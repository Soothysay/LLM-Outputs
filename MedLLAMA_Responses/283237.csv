   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1904**] is a 75 year old female with a PMH significant for AML s/p
   chemo and right-sided hemicolectomy for cecal mass found to be a low
   grade B cell lymphoma complicated by anastomotic leak and
   intra-abdominal abscesses s/p IR guided drain placement and washout
   with surgical drain placement now readmitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 29**] ICU for
   hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely
   secondary to sepsis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely  due  to sepsis/SIRS (tachycardia, leukocytosis)
   and intravascular volume depletion secondary to bleeding and
   hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.2).  She received 4u PRBC
   yesterday/overnight with hct this AM of 27.6.   Given degree of
   leukocytosis, likely combination of pre-existing MDS with superimposed
   infectious process and less likely leukemoid reaction.  Patient has had
   C.diff negative x1 in past week.  Given degree of leukocytosis,
   concerning for intra-abdominal abscess/infection versus C.diff colitis
   with increasing ostomy output.
   - Continue IV vanco, flagyl, pip/tazo
   - Add PO vanco for empiric C. diff coverage
   - Daily vanco AM levels, dose as needed with goal 15-20.
   - CT torso today.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Trend fever curve, WBC, monitor UOP.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Check stool C.diff toxin [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2
   - If continues to be hypotensive, bolus as necessary with
   crystalloid/pRBC. Patient may require additional CVL access as she only
   has a PICC with one usable port.
   - Will discuss with [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   .
   # Anemia: Hematocrit up top 27.6 this AM.  Given recent history of
   abdominal surgery and bloody ostomy output, likely is due to bleeding.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 4u PRBC yesterday.
   - Serial hct, transfuse for hct <25
   .
   # Post-op/anastomotic leak: As above. Currently hemodynamically
   stable.
   - Morphine prn.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Received 1u FFP prior to transfer to ICU for INR of
   1.7.  She has also received 10 mg PO and 2 mg IV last night.  Likely
   due to combination of malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis. INR this
   AM of 1.7.
   - Trend coags
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient developed ARF post-op likely secondary
   to ATN from intra-operative hypotension.  Creatinine continues to rise
   to 4.4 with potassium to 5.8 this AM.
   - Trend creatinine
   - ECG to assess for hyperkalemic changes.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Per renal, dose with IV lasix
   - Follow-up with renal regarding rising creatinine and potassium
   .
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma. Per
   oncology notes, patient refused bone marrow biopsy today.  Tentative
   plan to reattempt biopsy either today or Monday.
   - Follow-up with onc recs if any
   - Per onc, send Bcr-Abl today
   .
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc during admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear showed No
   blast, consistent with known MDS.
   - Follow-up with Onc

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and right-sided hemicolectomy for a cecal mass found to be a low-grade B-cell lymphoma. She was readmitted to the ICU for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis.

The patient received 4u PRBC yesterday and has a hematocrit of 27.6 this morning. She has a history of abdominal surgery and bloody ostomy output, which is likely contributing to her anemia. She has also received 1u FFP prior to transfer to ICU for an INR of 1.7.

The patient has a cecal mass with pathology consistent with low-grade B-cell lymphoma. She refused bone marrow biopsy today, but a tentative plan is to reattempt biopsy either today or Monday.

The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) post-op likely secondary to ATN from intra-operative hypotension. Her creatinine is rising to 4.4 with a potassium level of 5.8 this morning.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's worsening leukocytosis and hypotension suggest a high risk of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to bleeding, and if not properly managed, can lead to cardiovascular instability and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis, and if not properly managed, can lead to bleeding complications.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's ARF is likely due to ATN from intra-operative hypotension, and if not properly managed, can lead to end-stage renal disease and death.
5. Intra-abdominal abscess/infection: The patient's increasing ostomy output and leukocytosis suggest a high risk of intra-abdominal abscess/infection, which can lead to sepsis and death.
6. C. difficile colitis: The patient's increasing ostomy output and leukocytosis also suggest a high risk of C. difficile colitis, which can lead to sepsis and death.

To manage these potential complications, the patient should receive:

1. Continued IV vanco, flagyl, and pip/tazo for empiric C. diff coverage.
2. Daily vanco AM levels, dose as needed with a goal of 15-20.
3. CT torso today to evaluate for intra-abdominal abscess/infection.
4. Follow-up cultures and stool C. diff toxin testing.
5. Trend fever curve, WBC, and monitor UOP.
6. Check venous lactate and check stool C. diff toxin x2.
7. If hypotensive, bolus as necessary with crystalloid/pRBC.
8. Consider additional CVL access as the patient only has a PICC with one usable port.
9. Monitor UOP and creatinine, and adjust medication dosing accordingly.
10. Follow-up with renal regarding rising creatinine and potassium."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1904**] is a 75 year old female with a PMH significant for AML s/p
   chemo and right-sided hemicolectomy for cecal mass found to be a low
   grade B cell lymphoma complicated by anastomotic leak and
   intra-abdominal abscesses s/p IR guided drain placement and washout
   with surgical drain placement now readmitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 29**] ICU for
   hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely
   secondary to sepsis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely secondary to sepsis/SIRS (tachycardia,
   leukocytosis) and intravascular volume depletion secondary to bleeding
   and hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.2).  She received 2u PRBC today with
   hematocrit increase to 19.4, suggesting continued bleeding or
   hemolysis.  Given degree of leukocytosis, likely combination of
   pre-existing MDS with superimposed infectious process and less likely
   leukemoid reaction.  Patient has had C.diff negative x1 recently.
   Given degree of leukocytosis, concerning for intra-abdominal
   abscess/infection versus C.diff colitis with increasing ostomy output.
   - Continue IV vanco, flagyl, pip/tazo
   - Add PO vanco for empiric C. diff coverage
   - Daily vanco AM levels, dose as needed with goal 15-20.
   - Pan-culture, C.diff toxin [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2
   - Repeat CXR
   - Discussed with surgical resident, and plan for CT torso tomorrow.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC, monitor UOP.
   - Check lactate and fibrinogen.
   - Transfuse additional 2u PRBC
   - If continues to be hypotensive, bolus as necessary. Patient may
   require additional CVL access as she only has a PICC.
   .
   # Anemia: Hematocrit today of 17.9 from 28.8 yesterday.  Given recent
   history of abdominal surgery and bloody ostomy output, likely is due to
   bleeding.  Hemolysis labs negative. AM Hct pending. Received 4u PRBC
   yesterday.
   - Recheck hct this AM
   .
   # Post-op/anastomotic leak: As above. Currently hemodynamically
   stable.
   - Morphine and darvocet prn.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Received 1u FFP tonight prior to transfer to ICU for
   INR of 1.7.  She has also received 10 mg PO and 2 mg IV last night.
   - Trend coags
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient developed ARF post-op likely secondary
   to ATN from intra-operative hypotension.  Creatinine rise to 3.9 with
   potassium to 5.5 with no ECG changes.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Follow-up with Renal
   .
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma. Per
   oncology notes, patient refused bone marrow biopsy today.  Tentative
   plan to reattempt biopsy on Monday.
   - Follow-up with onc recs if any
   - Per onc, send Bcr-Abl
   .
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc during admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear showed No
   blast, consistent with known MDS.
   - Follow-up with Onc

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis. The patient has a complex medical history, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), right-sided hemicolectomy for a cecal mass found to be a low-grade B-cell lymphoma, and anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypotension: likely secondary to sepsis/SIRS, intravascular volume depletion, and bleeding.
* Anemia: likely due to bleeding, with a recent decrease in hematocrit from 28.8 to 17.9.
* Coagulopathy: with an INR of 1.7, which has been treated with 1u FFP.
* Acute renal failure: likely secondary to ATN from intra-operative hypotension, with a creatinine level of 3.9 and potassium level of 5.5.
* Worsening leukocytosis: likely due to a combination of pre-existing MDS and superimposed infectious process.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: which can lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
* Intra-abdominal abscesses: which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
* C. difficile colitis: which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
* Hemorrhagic complications: due to bleeding from the anastomotic site or other sources.
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): due to sepsis, pneumonia, or other causes.
* Cardiac complications: due to sepsis, cardiac tamponade, or other causes.
* Renal failure: which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and death.
* Gastrointestinal complications: such as bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications. The plan includes:

* Continued IV vancomycin, flagyl, and piperacillin-tazobactam for empiric coverage of C. difficile and other potential pathogens.
* Addition of PO vancomycin for empiric C. difficile coverage.
* Daily vancomycin levels and dose adjustments as needed.
* Pan-culture and C. difficile toxin testing.
* Repeat CXR and CT torso.
* Trend fever curve, WBC, and monitor UOP.
* Check lactate and fibrinogen levels.
* Transfusion of additional PRBCs.
* Bolus of fluids as needed to manage hypotension.
* Consideration of additional CVL access if the patient remains hypotensive.
* Recheck of hct and labs as needed.
* Follow-up with surgery, oncology, and other specialties as indicated."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1904**] is a 75 year old female with a PMH significant for AML s/p
   chemo and right-sided hemicolectomy for cecal mass found to be a low
   grade B cell lymphoma complicated by anastomotic leak and
   intra-abdominal abscesses s/p IR guided drain placement and washout
   with surgical drain placement now readmitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 29**] ICU for
   hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely
   secondary to sepsis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely secondary to sepsis/SIRS (tachycardia,
   leukocytosis) and intravascular volume depletion secondary to bleeding
   and hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.2).  She received 2u PRBC today with
   hematocrit increase to 19.4, suggesting continued bleeding or
   hemolysis.  Given degree of leukocytosis, likely combination of
   pre-existing MDS with superimposed infectious process and less likely
   leukemoid reaction.  Patient has had C.diff negative x1 recently.
   Given degree of leukocytosis, concerning for intra-abdominal
   abscess/infection versus C.diff colitis with increasing ostomy output.
   - Continue IV vanco, flagyl, pip/tazo
   - Add PO vanco for empiric C. diff coverage
   - Daily vanco AM levels, dose as needed with goal 15-20.
   - Pan-culture, C.diff toxin [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2
   - Repeat CXR
   - Discussed with surgical resident, and plan for CT torso tomorrow.
   - Trend fever curve, WBC, monitor UOP.
   - Check lactate and fibrinogen.
   - Transfuse additional 2u PRBC
   - If continues to be hypotensive, bolus as necessary. Patient may
   require additional CVL access as she only has a PICC.
   .
   # Anemia: Hematocrit today of 17.9 from 28.8 yesterday.  Given recent
   history of abdominal surgery and bloody ostomy output, likely is due to
   bleeding.  Hemolysis labs negative. AM Hct pending. Received 4u PRBC
   yesterday.
   - Recheck hct this AM
   .
   # Post-op/anastomotic leak: As above. Currently hemodynamically
   stable.
   - Morphine and darvocet prn.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Received 1u FFP tonight prior to transfer to ICU for
   INR of 1.7.  She has also received 10 mg PO and 2 mg IV last night.
   - Trend coags
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient developed ARF post-op likely secondary
   to ATN from intra-operative hypotension.  Creatinine rise to 3.9 with
   potassium to 5.5 with no ECG changes.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Follow-up with Renal
   .
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma. Per
   oncology notes, patient refused bone marrow biopsy today.  Tentative
   plan to reattempt biopsy on Monday.
   - Follow-up with onc recs if any
   - Per onc, send Bcr-Abl
   .
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc during admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear showed No
   blast, consistent with known MDS.

Summary:

The patient, a 75-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis. She has a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and right-sided hemicolectomy for a cecal mass found to be low-grade B-cell lymphoma complicated by anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses. The patient received 2u PRBC today with a hematocrit increase to 19.4, suggesting continued bleeding or hemolysis. She has a PICC line and is receiving IV vancomycin, flagyl, and pip/tazo.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and tachycardia suggest a high risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Intra-abdominal Abscess/Infection: The patient's worsening leukocytosis and increasing ostomy output suggest a high risk of intra-abdominal abscess or infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level of 3.9 and potassium level of 5.5 suggest a high risk of acute renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalance and organ dysfunction.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR of 1.7 and low platelet count suggest a high risk of coagulopathy, which can lead to bleeding and organ dysfunction.
5. Hemorrhage: The patient's hematocrit increase to 19.4 suggests continued bleeding or hemolysis, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction.
6. C. difficile Colitis: The patient's increasing ostomy output and leukocytosis suggest a high risk of C. difficile colitis, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
7. Anastomotic Leak: The patient's history of anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses suggests a high risk of further complications, including sepsis and organ dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV vancomycin, flagyl, and pip/tazo to treat sepsis and intra-abdominal infection.
2. Add PO vancomycin for empiric C. difficile coverage.
3. Monitor the patient's leukocytosis, hemoglobin, and platelet count closely.
4. Trend the patient's creatinine and potassium levels to monitor for acute renal failure.
5. Monitor the patient's INR and platelet count to monitor for coagulopathy.
6. Consider additional imaging studies, such as a CT scan, to evaluate for intra-abdominal abscess or infection.
7. Consider consulting with a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist or infectious disease specialist, to help manage the patient's condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a complex medical history, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a recent hemicolectomy for a cecal mass with anastomotic leak. She is currently in the ICU due to hypotension, suspected sepsis, and acute blood loss anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further sepsis due to the ongoing intra-abdominal infection and the presence of a colostomy. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies is necessary to detect any signs of worsening sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria and rising potassium levels suggest AKI, which may progress to acute on chronic renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration of dialysis may be necessary.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR of 1.7 suggests coagulopathy, which may increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of coagulation studies and correction of coagulopathy as needed are necessary.
4. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's hypotension and suspected acute blood loss anemia may lead to hypovolemic shock if not promptly treated.
5. B-cell Lymphoma: The patient's B-cell lymphoma may be progressing, and further evaluation with BCR/ABL testing is necessary to determine the best course of treatment.
6. Catheter-Related Complications: The patient's presence of a PICC line and other invasive lines increases the risk of catheter-related complications, such as infection, thrombosis, or bleeding.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of respiratory issues and the presence of a colostomy may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address these potential complications and improve her clinical outcomes."

   24 Hour Events:
 MULTI LUMEN - START [**2177-9-27**] 10:00 PM
   - ID: If patient worsens, considering switching from Zosyn to
   meropenem. Add caspofungin for additional coverage. Order more blood
   cultures. Awaiting CT abdomen/pelvis.
   - At 1400, 500cc NS bolus for hypotension (MAP 55-60) and continued
   poor urine output. Per surgery recs, also ordered furosemide 100mg IV
   x1. Anuric - no improvement.
   - Potassium slowly rising overnight to 7.0 at 2200. Per renal, manage
   medically. Given bicarb, insulin with D50, calcium. Lasix as above with
   no effect. EKG check x2 - no acute changes. At 0200, K 5.3.
   - CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:
        (1)Interval placement of right upper quadrant anterior approach
   Penrose drain and left lower quadrant diverting ileostomy.
        (2) Large intraperitoneal hematoma; high density possibly also
   partially due to oral contrast extravasation seen on prior CT
   examination.
        (3) Interval development of bilateral hydronephrosis possibly due
   to compression of the ureters by hematoma.
        (4) Decrease in right pleural effusion and resolution of left
   effusion, with improved lung aeration.
        (5) No change in subcutaneous pelvic soft tissue stranding, likely
   due to third spacing.
   - Given CT findings and hypotension requiring starting pressor
   (Levophed, max dose) in addition to acidosis in context of rising
   lactate, taken to OR; returned with open abdomen and intubated. Per
   surgery recs, not to be taken off sedation. Will return to OR on Monday
   to close.
   - Given Vitamin K, 2U pRBCs, 1U FFP, 1U platelets
   - Levophed weaned to 0.1

   Assessment and Plan
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   75 year old female with AML s/p chemo and right-sided hemicolectomy for
   cecal mass found to be a low grade B cell lymphoma complicated by
   anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses s/p IR guided drain
   placement and washout with surgical drain placement now readmitted to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening
   leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis.
   # Hypotension: Given large hematoma noted yesterday on CT, likely
   related to bleeding. Given markedly elevated WBC count and associated
   tachycardia + potential source for infection (abdomen), likely also a
   component of sepsis/SIRS. C. diff negative x1.
   - Continue vancomycin IV and flagyl IV for empiric coverage
   - Per ID recs, d/c Zosyn and begin meropenem given that patient has
   been persistently infected even with Zosyn on board
   - Daily vanc troughs (goal 15-20)
   - D/c vancomycin PO which was started yesterday given concern for C
   diff based on markedly elevated WBC count and no clear source of
   infection
   - Follow cultures, C diff toxin
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Recheck lactate; peaked at ~3.6 today
   # Anemia: Given 2U pRBCs yesterday. Good reason for blood loss anemia
   given large hematomas intraabdominally.
   - Serial hct, transfuse for hct <25
   # Post-op: Dressings changed by surgery.
   - Keep patient intubated and sedated until Monday; at that time will be
   taken back to OR for wound closure.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   # Coagulopathy: Stable. Given recent surgery, will aim for lower INR.
   Given vitamin K yesterday. Likely due to combination of
   malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis.
   - Trend INR
   - Repeat vitamin K this morning
   # Acute renal failure: Two good reasons for this
 ATN from hypotension
   + obstruction secondary to hematoma. Creatinine continues to rise.
   Potassium elevated as well. Excellent diuresis this morning following
   removal of hematoma which was causing bilateral hydronephrosis. Given
   several rounds of calcium, bicarbonate, insulin + D50.
   - Hold off on giving furosemide today
 autodiuresing very well.
   - ECG to assess for hyperkalemic changes
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Check renal recs
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma. Per
   oncology notes, patient refused bone marrow biopsy today.  Tentative
   plan to reattempt biopsy either today or Monday.
   - Follow-up with onc recs if any
   - Per onc, send Bcr-Abl today
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc during admission. Initial

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 MULTI LUMEN - START [**2177-9-27**] 10:00 PM
   - ID: If patient worsens, considering switching from Zosyn to
   meropenem. Add caspofungin for additional coverage. Order more blood
   cultures. Awaiting CT abdomen/pelvis.
   - At 1400, 500cc NS bolus for hypotension (MAP 55-60) and continued
   poor urine output. Per surgery recs, also ordered furosemide 100mg IV
   x1. Anuric - no improvement.
   - Potassium slowly rising overnight to 7.0 at 2200. Per renal, manage
   medically. Given bicarb, insulin with D50, calcium. Lasix as above with
   no effect. EKG check x2 - no acute changes. At 0200, K 5.3.
   - CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:
        (1)Interval placement of right upper quadrant anterior approach
   Penrose drain and left lower quadrant diverting ileostomy.
        (2) Large intraperitoneal hematoma; high density possibly also
   partially due to oral contrast extravasation seen on prior CT
   examination.
        (3) Interval development of bilateral hydronephrosis possibly due
   to compression of the ureters by hematoma.
        (4) Decrease in right pleural effusion and resolution of left
   effusion, with improved lung aeration.
        (5) No change in subcutaneous pelvic soft tissue stranding, likely
   due to third spacing.
   - Given CT findings and hypotension requiring starting pressor
   (Levophed, max dose) in addition to acidosis in context of rising
   lactate, taken to OR; returned with open abdomen and intubated. Per
   surgery recs, not to be taken off sedation. Will return to OR on Monday
   to close.
   - Given Vitamin K, 2U pRBCs, 1U FFP, 1U platelets
   - Levophed weaned to 0.1

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   75 year old female with AML s/p chemo and right-sided hemicolectomy for
   cecal mass found to be a low grade B cell lymphoma complicated by
   anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses s/p IR guided drain
   placement and washout with surgical drain placement now readmitted to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening
   leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis.
   # Hypotension: Given large hematoma noted yesterday on CT, likely
   related to bleeding. Given markedly elevated WBC count and associated
   tachycardia + potential source for infection (abdomen), likely also a
   component of sepsis/SIRS. C. diff negative x1.
   - Continue vancomycin IV and flagyl IV for empiric coverage
   - Per ID recs, d/c Zosyn and begin meropenem given that patient has
   been persistently infected even with Zosyn on board
   - Daily vanc troughs (goal 15-20)
   - D/c vancomycin PO which was started yesterday given concern for C
   diff based on markedly elevated WBC count and no clear source of
   infection
   - Follow cultures, C diff toxin
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Recheck lactate; peaked at ~3.6 today
   # Anemia: Given 2U pRBCs yesterday. Good reason for blood loss anemia
   given large hematomas intraabdominally.
   - Serial hct, transfuse for hct <25
   # Post-op: Dressings changed by surgery.
   - Keep patient intubated and sedated until Monday; at that time will be
   taken back to OR for wound closure.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   # Coagulopathy: Stable. Given recent surgery, will aim for lower INR.
   Given vitamin K yesterday. Likely due to combination of
   malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis.
   - Trend INR
   - Repeat vitamin K this morning
   # Acute renal failure: Two good reasons for this
 ATN from hypotension
   + obstruction secondary to hematoma. Creatinine continues to rise.
   Potassium elevated as well. Excellent diuresis this morning following
   removal of hematoma which was causing bilateral hydronephrosis. Given
   several rounds of calcium, bicarbonate, insulin + D50.
   - Hold off on giving furosemide today
 autodiuresing very well.
   - ECG to assess for hyperkalemic changes
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Check renal recs
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma. Per
   oncology notes, patient refused bone marrow biopsy today.  Tentative
   plan to reattempt biopsy either today or Monday.
   - Follow-up with onc recs if any
   - Per onc, send Bcr-Abl today
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc during admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear showed No

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and low-grade B-cell lymphoma, who underwent a right-sided hemicolectomy for a cecal mass and developed anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses. She was readmitted to the ICU for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis.

The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential complications:

1. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has a large hematoma, which may be causing bleeding and hypotension. She also has a high potassium level, which may be due to renal failure or other causes.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely due to hypotension and obstruction secondary to the hematoma. Her creatinine level is rising, and she has been given several rounds of calcium, bicarbonate, insulin, and D50 to manage her electrolyte imbalance.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a stable coagulopathy, which may be due to malnutrition, malabsorption, and sepsis. She has been given vitamin K and will be monitored for INR.
4. Sepsis: The patient has a high WBC count and associated tachycardia, which may be indicative of sepsis. She has been given antibiotics and will be monitored for fever and leukocytosis.
5. Anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses: The patient has a history of anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses, which may be contributing to her sepsis and other complications.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to bleeding, sepsis, or other causes.
7. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, which may be due to blood loss, anemia, or other causes.
8. Worsening leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is rising, which may be indicative of sepsis or other complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue vancomycin IV and flagyl IV for empiric coverage.
2. Begin meropenem and d/c Zosyn.
3. Monitor WBC count, fever curve, and lactate levels.
4. Trend INR and repeat vitamin K.
5. Hold off on giving furosemide and monitor UOP.
6. Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins.
7. Check renal recs and follow-up with surgery.
8. Follow-up with oncology and send Bcr-Abl.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte and fluid status.

The patient's code status is FULL, and her disposition is ICU level of care."

 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 1904**] is a 75 year old female with a PMH significant for AML s/p
   chemo and right-sided hemicolectomy for cecal mass found to be a low
   grade B cell lymphoma complicated by anastomotic leak and
   intra-abdominal abscesses s/p IR guided drain placement and washout
   with surgical drain placement now readmitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 29**] ICU for
   hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely
   secondary to sepsis.
   # Hypotension: Likely due to sepsis/SIRS (tachycardia, leukocytosis)
   and intravascular volume depletion secondary to bleeding and
   hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.2).  She received 4u PRBC
   yesterday/overnight with hct this AM of 27.6.   Given degree of
   leukocytosis, likely combination of pre-existing MDS with superimposed
   infectious process and less likely leukemoid reaction.  Patient has had
   C.diff negative x1 in past week.  Given degree of leukocytosis,
   concerning for intra-abdominal abscess/infection versus C.diff colitis
   with increasing ostomy output.
   - Continue IV vanco, flagyl, pip/tazo
   - Add PO vanco for empiric C. diff coverage
   - Daily vanco AM levels, dose as needed with goal 15-20.
   - CT torso today.
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Trend fever curve, WBC, monitor UOP.
   - Check venous lactate.
   - Check stool C.diff toxin [**Doctor First Name 1021**] x2
   - If continues to be hypotensive, bolus as necessary with
   crystalloid/pRBC. Patient may require additional CVL access as she only
   has a PICC with one usable port.
   - Will discuss with [**Doctor First Name 91**]
   # Anemia: Hematocrit up top 27.6 this AM.  Given recent history of
   abdominal surgery and bloody ostomy output, likely is due to bleeding.
   Hemolysis labs negative. Received 4u PRBC yesterday.
   - Serial hct, transfuse for hct <25
   # Post-op/anastomotic leak: As above. Currently hemodynamically
   stable.
   - Morphine prn.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   # Coagulopathy: Received 1u FFP prior to transfer to ICU for INR of
   1.7.  She has also received 10 mg PO and 2 mg IV last night.  Likely
   due to combination of malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis. INR this
   AM of 1.7.
   - Trend coags
   # Acute renal failure: Patient developed ARF post-op likely secondary
   to ATN from intra-operative hypotension.  Creatinine continues to rise
   to 4.4 with potassium to 5.8 this AM.
   - Trend creatinine
   - ECG to assess for hyperkalemic changes
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins.
   - Per renal, dose with IV lasix
   - Follow-up with renal regarding rising creatinine and potassium
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma. Per
   oncology notes, patient refused bone marrow biopsy today.  Tentative
   plan to reattempt biopsy either today or Monday.
   - Follow-up with onc recs if any
   - Per onc, send Bcr-Abl today
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc during admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear showed No
   blast, consistent with known MDS.
   - Follow-up with Onc
   # DM 2: ISS and accuchecks.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 MULTI LUMEN - START [**2177-9-27**] 10:00 PM
   - ID: If patient worsens, considering switching from Zosyn to
   meropenem. Add caspofungin for additional coverage. Order more blood
   cultures. Awaiting CT abdomen/pelvis.
   - At 1400, 500cc NS bolus for hypotension (MAP 55-60) and continued
   poor urine output. Per surgery recs, also ordered furosemide 100mg IV
   x1. Anuric - no improvement.
   - Potassium slowly rising overnight to 7.0 at 2200. Per renal, manage
   medically. Given bicarb, insulin with D50, calcium. Lasix as above with
   no effect. EKG check x2 - no acute changes. At 0200, K 5.3.
   - CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:
        (1)Interval placement of right upper quadrant anterior approach
   Penrose drain and left lower quadrant diverting ileostomy.
        (2) Large intraperitoneal hematoma; high density possibly also
   partially due to oral contrast extravasation seen on prior CT
   examination.
        (3) Interval development of bilateral hydronephrosis possibly due
   to compression of the ureters by hematoma.
        (4) Decrease in right pleural effusion and resolution of left
   effusion, with improved lung aeration.
        (5) No change in subcutaneous pelvic soft tissue stranding, likely
   due to third spacing.
   - Given CT findings and hypotension requiring starting pressor
   (Levophed, max dose) in addition to acidosis in context of rising
   lactate, taken to OR; returned with open abdomen and intubated. Per
   surgery recs, not to be taken off sedation. Will return to OR on Monday

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of anastomotic leak, intra-abdominal abscesses, and sepsis, which increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is rising, and potassium is increasing, which may indicate ARF.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of bleeding and is receiving blood products, which increases the risk of coagulopathy.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's potassium level is increasing, which may indicate an electrolyte imbalance.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of cardiac disease and is receiving pressors, which increases the risk of cardiac complications.
7. Infection: The patient has a history of intra-abdominal abscesses and is at risk of developing further infections.
8. Hemorrhage: The patient has a history of bleeding and is at risk of further hemorrhage.
9. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and may be at risk of malnutrition.
10. Wound Complications: The patient has a history of surgical wounds and is at risk of developing wound complications.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Electrolyte and fluid disorder
* Abdominal pain (including abdominal tenderness)
* Renal failure, acute
* Hypotension
* Anemia
* Coagulopathy
* Post-op/anastomotic leak
* Acute renal failure

The plan includes:

* Continue IV vanco, flagyl, and pip/tazo
* Add PO vanco for empiric C. diff coverage
* Daily vanco AM levels, dose as needed with goal 15-20
* CT torso today
* Follow-up cultures

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

She underwent a right hemicolectomy with anastomotic leak and has an ostomy. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypotension, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, open abdominal wound, hyperkalemia, and shock from acute blood loss anemia.

The patient's 24-hour events include:

* Urine output did not improve with Lasix or fluid resuscitation
* Continued hyperkalemia, treated with bicarbonate
* CT torso showed an increase in intraperitoneal hematoma with bilateral hydronephrosis, pleural effusions decreased
* Worsening hypotension requiring levophed and development of acidosis
* Went to the operating room (OR) for hematoma evacuation and wounds left open, received blood, platelets, and FFP

The patient's vital signs include:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.5°F)
* Heart rate: 103 bpm (97-127 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 104/55 mmHg (70-136/65-90 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 18 inspirations per minute (13-43 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's laboratory results include:

* Hemoglobin: 9.6 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 52.0
* Platelet count: 116
* Creatinine: 3.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 26.7 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: potassium 22 mEq/L, sodium 5.8 mEq/L, chloride 87 mg/dL, magnesium 2.2 mg/dL, phosphorus 7.9 mg/dL
* Coagulation studies: INR 21.0, partial thromboplastin time 49.2 seconds, fibrinogen 502 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.3 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.6 g/dL
* LDH: 516 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies include:

* CXR: continued right effusion, patchy infiltrates, endotracheal tube low and heading towards the right mainstem bronchus

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Problem: Cecal B-cell lymphoma s/p hemicolectomy, colostomy for anastomotic leak, now s/p peritoneal hematoma evacuation
* Acute respiratory failure
* Acute renal failure from post-obstructive uropathy +/- pre-renal/ATN
* Open abdominal wound
* Hyperkalemia in the setting of ARF
* Shock from acute blood loss anemia

The patient's plan includes:

* Pressor requirements decreased since OR/hematoma evacuation yesterday
* Remain on levophed, adjust for MAP > 60
* Per ID change to meropenem
* Hct unchanged
* Continue bicarb drip and check K levels
* Urine output is beginning to increase, hopefully renal function and hyperkalemia will begin to improve s/p hematoma evacuation
* INR still high, administer further vitamin K
* Intubated prior to surgery with no plans to wean today as she requires heavy sedation/pain control due to open abdominal wound
* Oxygenation adequate, move ETT which appears too low
* Peritoneal hematoma: back to OR tomorrow to close wound

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: TPN
* Glycemic control: monitor blood glucose levels
* Lines: PICC line, 22-gauge line, multi-lumen line
* Prophylaxis: DVT boots, stress ulcer PPI, VAP HOB elevation, mouth care
* Communication: code status: full code, disposition: ICU, total time spent: 45 minutes
* Patient is critically ill."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone chemotherapy, right hemicolectomy, and ostomy creation for B-cell lymphoma. She has developed a peritoneal hematoma and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of her condition.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Hypotension requiring pressor support with levophed
* Hyperkalemia treated with bicarbonate
* Acute respiratory failure requiring intubation
* Acute renal failure from post-obstructive uropathy and possibly pre-renal or atn
* Open abdominal wound
* Coagulopathy with an elevated INR
* Shock from acute blood loss anemia

The patient's laboratory results show:
* Hemoglobin (Hb) 9.6 g/dL
* White blood cell count (WBC) 52.0
* Platelet count (Plt) 116

 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   75 year old female with AML s/p chemo and right-sided hemicolectomy for
   cecal mass found to be a low grade B cell lymphoma complicated by
   anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses s/p IR guided drain
   placement and washout with surgical drain placement now readmitted to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening
   leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis.
   # Hypotension: Improved today, but remains pressor dependent after
   hematoma evacuation.  Given markedly elevated WBC count and associated
   tachycardia + potential source for infection (abdomen), possibly a
   component of sepsis/SIRS, although less likely as hypotension improved
   with hemostasis. C. diff negative x2.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) 350**] for now
   - Continue norepinephrine until OR
   - Transfuse 1 U prior to OR
   # Anemia: Given 2U pRBCs [**2177-9-28**]. Good reason for blood loss anemia
   given large hematomas intraabdominally.
   - Serial hct, transfuse for hct <25
   - transfuse 1 U as above
   .
   # Post-op: Dressings changed by surgery.
   - will be taken back to OR for wound closure vs washout and re-pack.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely [**1-4**] to consumption with large abdominal
   hematoma.
   - recheck platelets this PM
   # Coagulopathy: may be [**1-4**] thrombocytopenia. Given recent surgery, will
   aim for lower INR. Given vitamin K [**2177-9-28**]. Likely due to combination
   of malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis.
   - Trend INR
   - Likely will need FFP per surgery.
   # Acute renal failure: Two good reasons for this
 ATN from hypotension
   + obstruction secondary to hematoma. Creatinine stable today. Potassium
   back to normal. Excellent diuresis this morning following removal of
   hematoma which was causing bilateral hydronephrosis.
   - Hold off on giving furosemide today
 autodiuresing very well.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Check renal recs
   .
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma. Per
   oncology notes, patient refused bone marrow biopsy today.  Tentative
   plan to reattempt biopsy today.
   - Follow-up with onc recs if any
   - Per onc, f/u Bcr-Abl today
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc during admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear showed No
   blast, consistent with known MDS.
   - Follow-up with Onc

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   75 year old female with AML s/p chemo and right-sided hemicolectomy for
   cecal mass found to be a low grade B cell lymphoma complicated by
   anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses s/p IR guided drain
   placement and washout with surgical drain placement now readmitted to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening
   leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis.
   # Hypotension: Improved today, but remains pressor dependent after
   hematoma evacuation.  Given markedly elevated WBC count and associated
   tachycardia + potential source for infection (abdomen), possibly a
   component of sepsis/SIRS, although less likely as hypotension improved
   with hemostasis. C. diff negative x2.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) 350**] for now
   - Continue norepinephrine until OR
   - Transfuse 1 U prior to OR
   # Anemia: Given 2U pRBCs [**2177-9-28**]. Good reason for blood loss anemia
   given large hematomas intraabdominally.
   - Serial hct, transfuse for hct <25
   - transfuse 1 U as above
   .
   # Post-op: Dressings changed by surgery.
   - will be taken back to OR for wound closure vs washout and re-pack.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely [**1-4**] to consumption with large abdominal
   hematoma.
   - recheck platelets this PM
   # Coagulopathy: may be [**1-4**] thrombocytopenia. Given recent surgery, will
   aim for lower INR. Given vitamin K [**2177-9-28**]. Likely due to combination
   of malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis.
   - Trend INR
   - Likely will need FFP per surgery.
   # Acute renal failure: Two good reasons for this
 ATN from hypotension
   + obstruction secondary to hematoma. Creatinine stable today. Potassium
   back to normal. Excellent diuresis this morning following removal of
   hematoma which was causing bilateral hydronephrosis.
   - Hold off on giving furosemide today
 autodiuresing very well.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Check renal recs
   .
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma. Per
   oncology notes, patient refused bone marrow biopsy today.  Tentative
   plan to reattempt biopsy today.
   - Follow-up with onc recs if any
   - Per onc, f/u Bcr-Abl today
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc during admission. Initial

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a right-sided hemicolectomy for a cecal mass found to be a low-grade B-cell lymphoma. She was readmitted to the ICU for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis. The patient's condition has improved with evacuation of the hematoma, but she remains pressor-dependent and has ongoing electrolyte and fluid disorders.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis/SIRS: The patient's elevated WBC count, tachycardia, and potential source of infection in the abdomen suggest that sepsis/SIRS may be a concern. Close monitoring of the WBC count and fever curve is recommended.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is stable, but she has ongoing renal failure. Close monitoring of the UOP and renal function is recommended, and nephrotoxins should be avoided.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, and she has ongoing thrombocytopenia. Close monitoring of the INR and platelet count is recommended, and FFP may be necessary.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has ongoing electrolyte disorders, including hypokalemia and hypocalcemia. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels is recommended, and replacement therapy may be necessary.
5. Wound Infection: The patient's wounds are left open, and there is a risk of wound infection. Close monitoring of the wounds and laboratory results is recommended.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and has ongoing respiratory failure. Close monitoring of the respiratory status and oxygenation is recommended.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypotension and pressor dependence may indicate cardiac complications. Close monitoring of the cardiac status and cardiac function is recommended.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's WBC count and fever curve for signs of sepsis/SIRS.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function and UOP closely, and avoid nephrotoxins.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's INR and platelet count, and consider FFP if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and replace as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's wound status and laboratory results for signs of wound infection.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and cardiac function closely.

These complications and recommendations are based on the information provided in the progress note and may not be exhaustive."

   is sedated and intubated, appeared comfortable on morning rounds.
   Abdomen distended, packed open wound, colostomy. No bowel sounds
   heard.   She continues on low dose norepinephrine albeit have been
   weaning off.  Her urine output picked up significantly after evacuation
   of the clot, likely a postobstructive diureiss.  WBC slightly decreased

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   75 year old female with AML s/p chemo and right-sided hemicolectomy for
   cecal mass found to be a low grade B cell lymphoma complicated by
   anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses s/p IR guided drain
   placement and washout with surgical drain placement now readmitted to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening
   leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis.
   # Hypotension: Improved today, but remains pressor dependent after
   hematoma evacuation.  Given markedly elevated WBC count and associated
   tachycardia + potential source for infection (abdomen), possibly a
   component of sepsis/SIRS, although less likely as hypotension improved
   with hemostasis. C. diff negative x2.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) 350**] for now
   - Continue norepinephrine until OR
   - Transfuse 1 U prior to OR
   # Anemia: Given 2U pRBCs [**2177-9-28**]. Good reason for blood loss anemia
   given large hematomas intraabdominally.
   - Serial hct, transfuse for hct <25
   - transfuse 1 U as above
   .
   # Post-op: Dressings changed by surgery.
   - will be taken back to OR for wound closure vs washout and re-pack.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely [**1-4**] to consumption with large abdominal
   hematoma.
   - recheck platelets this PM
   # Coagulopathy: may be [**1-4**] thrombocytopenia. Given recent surgery, will
   aim for lower INR. Given vitamin K [**2177-9-28**]. Likely due to combination
   of malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis.
   - Trend INR
   - Likely will need FFP per surgery.
   # Acute renal failure: Two good reasons for this
 ATN from hypotension
   + obstruction secondary to hematoma. Creatinine stable today. Potassium
   back to normal. Excellent diuresis this morning following removal of
   hematoma which was causing bilateral hydronephrosis.
   - Hold off on giving furosemide today
 autodiuresing very well.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Check renal recs
   .
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma. Per
   oncology notes, patient refused bone marrow biopsy today.  Tentative
   plan to reattempt biopsy today.
   - Follow-up with onc recs if any
   - Per onc, f/u Bcr-Abl today
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc during admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear showed No
   blast, consistent with known MDS.

   resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with Dr.
   [**Initials (NamePattern4) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2148**]
s note including the assessment and plan as above.  The patient
   is sedated and intubated, appeared comfortable on morning rounds.
   Abdomen distended, packed open wound, colostomy. No bowel sounds
   heard.   She continues on low dose norepinephrine albeit have been
   weaning off.  Her urine output picked up significantly after evacuation
   of the clot, likely a postobstructive diureiss.  WBC slightly decreased
   ableit still 79K. Hct 23.8, stable, plts as aove.  Discussed with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 2149**] who plans to take her back to OR and if no evidence of bleeding
   will consider unpacking and closing the abdominal incision.  Plan to
   transfuse 1 u pRBCs on the way to the OR.  Patient remains critically
   ill.  Total time spend was 50 minutes.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), who underwent a right-sided hemicolectomy for a cecal mass found to be a low-grade B-cell lymphoma. She developed anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses, which were treated with IR-guided drain placement and washout. She was readmitted to the ICU for hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 112/45 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is intubated and sedated. Her respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 79,000 cells/μL
* Hemoglobin: 8.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 88,000 cells/μL
* Creatinine: 1.37 mg/dL
* Potassium: 4.3 mmol/L
* Lactic acid: 2.3 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.6 g/dL
* LDH: 516 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 7.0 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Electrolyte and fluid disorder
* Abdominal pain
* Acute renal failure
* Anemia
* Coagulopathy
* Thrombocytopenia
* Cecal mass (low-grade B-cell lymphoma)
* Acute myeloid leukemia

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Trend WBC count and fever curve
* Continue norepinephrine until OR
* Transfuse 1 U prior to OR
* Serial hct, transfuse for hct <25
* Recheck platelets this PM
* Trend INR
* Likely will need FFP per surgery
* Hold off on giving furosemide today
* Monitor UOP
* Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
* Check renal recs
* Follow-up with oncology notes
* Per onc, f/u Bcr-Abl today

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Acute kidney injury
* Respiratory failure
* Bleeding complications
* Thrombotic complications
* Infection-related complications
* Hemorrhagic complications

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who has undergone chemotherapy and a right-sided hemicolectomy for a cecal mass found to be a low-grade B-cell lymphoma. She was readmitted to the ICU due to hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis likely secondary to sepsis.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

* Electrolyte and fluid disorder
* Abdominal pain, including abdominal tenderness
* Acute renal failure, likely secondary to hypotension and obstruction from a hematoma
* Coagulopathy, possibly due to malnutrition, malabsorption, and sepsis
* Leukocytosis, possibly secondary to sepsis and infection

The patient is receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, blood transfusions, and medication to manage her symptoms. She is intubated and sedated and will be taken back to the operating room for wound closure on Monday.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Coagulopathy and bleeding
* Infection and abscess formation
* Worsening anemia and bleeding
* Hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias
* Hypotension and cardiovascular instability

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and low-grade B-cell lymphoma. She underwent a hemicolectomy and was readmitted to the ICU for sepsis, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis.

The patient underwent a wound closure and washout procedure, which was tolerated well. She received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 1 unit of platelets. Her hemoglobin (Hct) level increased from 23.2 to 27.7, and her platelet count increased from 78 to 100.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 103 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 116/59 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 21 inspirations per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 98%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 72.8, which is down from 79.4 the previous day. Her creatinine level is stable at 4.6 mg/dL, and her lactate level is 1.7 mmol/L.

The patient's medical conditions include anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, acute renal failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2. She is receiving treatment for sepsis, including antibiotics and vasopressors.

The patient's medications include vancomycin, caspofungin, metronidazole, and fentanyl. She is also receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and lipids.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

1. Sepsis management: Continue vancomycin, caspofungin, and metronidazole, and monitor for signs of sepsis.
2. Anemia management: Transfuse 2 more units of PRBCs, and monitor Hct levels.
3. Thrombocytopenia management: Monitor platelet counts and transfuse platelets as needed.
4. Coagulopathy management: Monitor INR levels and administer vitamin K as needed.
5. Acute renal failure management: Monitor urine output and creatinine levels, and avoid nephrotoxins.
6. Diabetes management: Monitor blood glucose levels and adjust insulin dosing as needed.
7. Nutrition management: Continue TPN and lipids, and monitor for signs of malnutrition.
8. Prophylaxis: Administer stress ulcer prophylaxis, and monitor for signs of stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is being managed with antibiotics and vasopressors, but it is essential to monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust treatment as needed.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is being managed with transfusions, but it is essential to monitor Hct levels and adjust transfusion rates as needed.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is being managed with platelet transfusions, but it is essential to monitor platelet counts and adjust transfusion rates as needed.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is being managed with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma, but it is essential to monitor INR levels and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is being managed with fluid restriction and monitoring of creatinine levels, but it is essential to monitor urine output and adjust treatment as needed.
6. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is being managed with insulin and glucose monitoring, but it is essential to monitor blood glucose levels and adjust insulin dosing as needed.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition is being managed with TPN and lipids, but it is essential to monitor for signs of malnutrition and adjust nutrition management as needed.

In conclusion, the patient's health progress in the ICU is stable, with ongoing management of sepsis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, acute renal failure, and diabetes. It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical conditions closely to adjust treatment as needed and prevent potential medical complications."

   IR guided drain placement and washout with surgical drain now
   readmitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for sepsis (hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy,
   and worsening leukocytosis), now POD#1 from would closure and wash out.
   # Sepsis: Was on and off Levophed overnight. Currently off pressors
   following closure of her ventral wound.  WBC 72.8 down from 79.4
   yesterday AM. Tachy in low 100s. Cultures NGTD. C. diff negative x2.
   Afebrile since procedure.
   - Following WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 350**]/Caspofungin/ Flagyl
   - Transfuse  U prior to OR
   # Post-op: Pt taken back to OR for wound closure, washout and re-pack
   overnight. Tolerated procedure well. Anterior drains with good output.
   Posterior drains with minimal inferiorly, no drainage superiorly.
   - Follow-up surgery recs
   # Anemia: Given 2U pRBCs [**2177-9-28**], 1 ([**9-29**]), Hct 21 this AM, will
   transfuse 2 more pRBCs.
   - Serial hct, transfuse for hct <25
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: AM level pending. Will likely need further
   transfusions of platlets [**1-4**] to both consumption in abdominal hematoma
   and dilutional secondary to blood transfusions.
   - Serial Platlets checks and transfusion
   # Coagulopathy: INR may be [**1-4**] thrombocytopenia. Given recent surgery,
   will aim for lower INR. Given vitamin K [**2177-9-28**]. Likely due to
   combination of malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis.
   - Trend INR
   - 2 units of FFP this AM for INR of 1.7.
   # Acute renal failure: Good UOP overnight. Differential etiologies were
   ATN from hypotension + obstruction secondary to hematoma. Creatinine
   stable today at 4.6 from 4.5.
   - Hold off on giving furosemide today
 autodiuresing very well.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Check renal recs
   .
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma.
   - Follow-up with onc recs
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc during admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear showed No
   blast, consistent with known MDS.
   - Follow-up with Onc
   # DM 2: FS 140-150s overnight.

   I saw and examined the patient with the medical resident, reviewed 24
   hour events and was present for key portions of the services provided.
   Patient continues to be critically ill, ventilated for respiratory
   failure.  To OR yesterday where abdomen was unpacked and wound closed.
   A-line came out overnight. Overnight hct dropped to 21 without evidence
   of increased output from surgical drains.  Weaned off pressors at 5 am
   albeit given hemodynamic lability needed to go back on at 0945 just
   prior to our rounding.  Low grade fevers overnight. Lungs with
   scattered crackles albeit mostly dependent.  Tachy, regular. Abdomen
   distended, midline wound dressing clean and dry. Anasarca increased.
   Unresponsive even to noxious stimuli, have decreased fentanyl and
   versed as suspect she is oversedated.  Labs notable for WBC 72, plts
   100K, INR 1.7.  No new culture data.
   Problems:
   1)       Chronic respiratory failure secondary to volume overload.  Has
   had secretions, mostly described as frothy albeit today more thick,
   tan.  Bronchoscopy showed minimal frothy secretions throughout, BAL
   clear sent for gram stain, C+S as per surgery. Continues broad spectum
   abx/antifungal therapy. Need to readdress with ID service as to
   endpoint.  Try to diurese with blood transfusions today if blood
   pressure will tolerate.  Needs a-line replaced as this came out
   overnight.
   2)       Anemia:  No clear evidence of blood loss in abdomen given
   drains not producing much output.  Will give FFP to maintain INR <1.5.
   Plts up to 100K.  Follow serial CBC, if trending down will obtain
   repeat CT of the abdomen.
   3)       Hypotension secondary to hypovolemia vs. sepsis:  Managing
   with IVF challenge, transfuse pRBCs as above given hct drop, continues
   broad spectum abx.
   4)       Acute renal failure secondary to hematoma/obstruction and
   component of ATN related to episodes of hypotension.  Cr stable from
   yesterday.  Trying to aggressively avoid further hypotensive insults as
   above. Dose meds accordingly.
   Else assessment and plan as per Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 1538**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   I saw and examined the patient with the medical resident, reviewed 24
   hour events and was present for key portions of the services provided.
   Patient continues to be critically ill, ventilated for respiratory
   failure.  To OR yesterday where abdomen was unpacked and wound closed.
   A-line came out overnight. Overnight hct dropped to 21 without evidence
   of increased output from surgical drains.  Weaned off pressors at 5 am
   albeit given hemodynamic lability needed to go back on at 0945 just
   prior to our rounding.  Low grade fevers overnight. Lungs with
   scattered crackles albeit mostly dependent.  Tachy, regular. Abdomen
   distended, midline wound dressing clean and dry. Anasarca increased.
   Unresponsive even to noxious stimuli, have decreased fentanyl and
   versed as suspect she is oversedated.  Labs notable for WBC 72, plts
   100K, INR 1.7.  No new culture data.
   Problems:
   1)       Chronic respiratory failure secondary to volume overload.  Has
   had secretions, mostly described as frothy albeit today more thick,
   tan.  Bronchoscopy showed minimal frothy secretions throughout, BAL
   clear sent for gram stain, C+S as per surgery. Continues broad spectum
   abx/antifungal therapy. Need to readdress with ID service as to
   endpoint.  Try to diurese with blood transfusions today if blood
   pressure will tolerate.  Needs a-line replaced as this came out
   overnight.
   2)       Anemia:  No clear evidence of blood loss in abdomen given
   drains not producing much output.  Will give FFP to maintain INR <1.5.
   Plts up to 100K.  Follow serial CBC, if trending down will obtain
   repeat CT of the abdomen.
   3)       Hypotension secondary to hypovolemia vs. sepsis:  Managing
   with IVF challenge, transfuse pRBCs as above given hct drop, continues
   broad spectum abx.
   4)       Acute renal failure secondary to hematoma/obstruction and
   component of ATN related to episodes of hypotension.  Cr stable from
   yesterday.  Trying to aggressively avoid further hypotensive insults as
   above. Dose meds accordingly.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), low-grade B-cell lymphoma, and a recent hemicolectomy for a cecal mass. She was admitted to the ICU with sepsis, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis.

The patient underwent a wound closure and washout procedure in the operating room, during which she received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 1 unit of platelets. She was also given vancomycin, caspofungin, and metronidazole for antibiotic coverage.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 103 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 116/59 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on a FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 72.8 K/μL, platelet count of 100 K/μL, and hemoglobin of 21.0 g/dL. Her international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.7, and her creatinine level is 4.6 mg/dL.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a respiratory rate of 21 inspirations per minute and a respiratory system compliance of 23.8 cmH2O/mL. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's abdominal status is also critical, with anastomotic leaks and intra-abdominal abscesses. She has a midline incision and loop ileostomy, and her surgical drains are intact.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Chronic respiratory failure secondary to volume overload: The patient has had secretions, mostly described as frothy, and bronchoscopy showed minimal frothy secretions throughout.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 21.0 g/dL, and she has received 2 units of PRBCs.
3. Hypotension secondary to hypovolemia vs. sepsis: The patient's blood pressure is 116/59 mmHg, and she is receiving IV fluids and pressors.
4. Acute renal failure secondary to hematoma/obstruction and component of ATN related to episodes of hypotension: The patient's creatinine level is 4.6 mg/dL, and she is receiving IV fluids and diuretics.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her underlying medical conditions and the presence of anastomotic leaks and intra-abdominal abscesses.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require further respiratory support.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 4.6 mg/dL, and she may require further renal support.
4. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is 100 K/μL, and she may be at risk for bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's wound and surgical drains are at risk for infection, and she may require further antibiotic coverage.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for sepsis.
2. Continue vancomycin, caspofungin, and metronidazole for antibiotic coverage.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust diuretic therapy as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust platelet transfusions as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's wound and surgical drains for signs of infection.
7. Consider further surgical intervention for anastomotic leaks and intra-abdominal abscesses.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill 75-year-old female with a history of AML, low-grade B-cell lymphoma, and a recent hemicolectomy for a cecal mass. She is at risk for multiple medical complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, renal failure, bleeding, and infection. Her treatment plan includes ongoing antibiotic coverage, respiratory support, renal support, and bleeding risk monitoring."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities and complications. The patient's condition is characterized by:

1. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and their respiratory status is compromised, with a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 232.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin is not assessed, which may indicate the presence of pressure ulcers or other skin complications.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.6 mg/dL, sodium level of 142 mmol/L, and chloride level of 107 mmol/L.
5. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by the elevated creatinine level of 5.0 mg/dL.
6. Abdominal pain: The patient is experiencing abdominal pain, which may be related to their underlying condition or a complication.
7. Nutritional compromise: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids, which may indicate a compromised nutritional status.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's heart rate is 103 beats per minute, and their blood pressure is 116/59 mmHg, which may indicate cardiovascular instability.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal electrolyte levels may indicate the presence of sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output may indicate acute kidney injury.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's compromised respiratory status and elevated respiratory rate may indicate respiratory distress.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal pain and altered nutrition may indicate gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
6. Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
7. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and abnormal electrolyte levels may increase their risk of infection.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   75yoF with AML s/p chemo and R  hemicolectomy for cecal mass (low grade
   B cell lymphoma) c/b anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses s/p
   IR guided drain placement and washout with surgical drain now
   readmitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for sepsis (hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy,
   and worsening leukocytosis)
   # Hypotension: Improved today, but remains pressor dependent after
   hematoma evacuation.  Given markedly elevated WBC count and associated
   tachycardia + potential source for infection (abdomen), possibly a
   component of sepsis/SIRS, although less likely as hypotension improved
   with hemostasis. C. diff negative x2.
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve
   - Continue [**Last Name (un) 350**] for now
   - Continue norepinephrine until OR
   - Transfuse 1 U prior to OR
   # Anemia: Given 2U pRBCs [**2177-9-28**]. Good reason for blood loss anemia
   given large hematomas intraabdominally.
   - Serial hct, transfuse for hct <25
   - transfuse 1 U as above
   .
   # Post-op: Dressings changed by surgery.
   - will be taken back to OR for wound closure vs washout and re-pack.
   - Follow-up with surgery
   # Thrombocytopenia: Likely [**1-4**] to consumption with large abdominal
   hematoma.
   - recheck platelets this PM
   # Coagulopathy: may be [**1-4**] thrombocytopenia. Given recent surgery, will
   aim for lower INR. Given vitamin K [**2177-9-28**]. Likely due to combination
   of malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis.
   - Trend INR
   - Likely will need FFP per surgery.
   # Acute renal failure: Two good reasons for this
 ATN from hypotension
   + obstruction secondary to hematoma. Creatinine stable today. Potassium
   back to normal. Excellent diuresis this morning following removal of
   hematoma which was causing bilateral hydronephrosis.
   - Hold off on giving furosemide today
 autodiuresing very well.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   - Check renal recs
   .
   # Cecal mass: Pathology consistent with low grade B cell lymphoma. Per
   oncology notes, patient refused bone marrow biopsy today.  Tentative
   plan to reattempt biopsy today.
   - Follow-up with onc recs if any
   - Per onc, f/u Bcr-Abl today
   # AML: Treated [**2171**], followed by Heme/Onc during admission. Initial
   concern for recurrence given leukocytosis - peripheral smear showed No
   blast, consistent with known MDS.
   - Follow-up with Onc

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy and hemicolectomy for a cecal mass (low-grade B-cell lymphoma). She developed an anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses, which were treated with interventional radiology-guided drain placement and washout. The patient was readmitted to the ICU for sepsis, characterized by hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T = 36.1°C, HR = 103 bpm, BP = 116/59 mmHg, RR = 21 breaths/min, SpO2 = 98%
* Laboratory results: WBC = 87.7 K/μL, Hct = 23.8%, Plt = 78 K/μL, Cr = 5.0 mg/dL, TropT = 0.04 ng/mL, TCO2 = 26 mmHg, Glucose = 111 mg/dL
* Physical examination: Intubated, sedated, with equal breath sounds bilaterally, no wheezing or rhonchi; 3+ edema to the knees bilaterally; JP drain with bloody fluid

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis/SIRS: The patient's elevated WBC count, tachycardia, and potential source of infection (abdomen) make sepsis/SIRS a possible complication.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and potential obstruction secondary to the hematoma make acute renal failure a concern.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be due to consumption with the large abdominal hematoma.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and potential bleeding complications make coagulopathy a concern.
5. Anastomotic leak: The patient's previous anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses may lead to further complications if not properly managed.
6. Infection: The patient's WBC count and potential source of infection (abdomen) make infection a possible complication.
7. Hypotension: The patient's pressor-dependent hypotension may lead to further complications if not properly managed.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Trend WBC count and fever curve
* Continue norepinephrine until OR
* Transfuse 1 U prior to OR
* Serial hct, transfuse for hct <25
* Follow-up with surgery
* Trend INR
* Likely will need FFP per surgery
* Hold off on giving furosemide today
* Monitor UOP
* Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
* Check renal recs
* Follow-up with onc recs if any
* Per onc, f/u Bcr-Abl today

   transfusions of platlets [**1-4**] to both consumption in abdominal hematoma
   and dilutional secondary to blood transfusions.
   - Serial Platlets checks and transfusion
   # Coagulopathy: INR may be [**1-4**] thrombocytopenia. Given recent surgery,
   will aim for lower INR. Given vitamin K [**2177-9-28**]. Likely due to
   combination of malnutrition/malabsorption and sepsis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass (low-grade B-cell lymphoma) and developed an anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses. She was readmitted to the ICU for sepsis, hypotension, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis. She underwent a wound closure, washout, and re-pack procedure in the operating room.

Current condition:

* Hypotension (BP: 95/50 mmHg)
* Anemia (Hct: 21%)
* Coagulopathy (INR: 1.7)
* Thrombocytopenia (Plt: 79)
* Acute renal failure (Creatinine: 4.6 mg/dL)
* Leukocytosis (WBC: 72.8 K/uL)
* Respiratory failure (requiring mechanical ventilation)

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to the intra-abdominal abscesses and anastomotic leak. Monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and antibiotic therapy is essential to prevent further complications.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she requires close monitoring of her renal function. Dose adjustment of medications and avoidance of nephrotoxins are necessary to prevent further kidney damage.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy increase the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of platelet counts and coagulation studies is necessary to prevent bleeding.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires close monitoring of her oxygenation and ventilation. Adjustments to her mechanical ventilation settings and consideration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be necessary.
5. Infection: The patient's wound and intra-abdominal abscesses increase the risk of infection. Monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and antibiotic therapy is essential to prevent further complications.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may worsen her overall condition and increase the risk of complications. Nutritional support, such as total parenteral nutrition (TPN), may be necessary to prevent malnutrition.

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy for sepsis and wound infection.
2. Monitor vital signs, blood cultures, and coagulation studies to prevent bleeding complications.
3. Adjust medication dosages and avoid nephrotoxins to prevent AKI.
4. Monitor respiratory function and adjust mechanical ventilation settings as necessary.
5. Consider extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) if respiratory failure persists.
6. Monitor wound and intra-abdominal abscesses for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary.
7. Provide nutritional support, such as TPN, to prevent malnutrition.
8. Monitor platelet counts and transfuse platelets as necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
9. Monitor INR and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary to prevent bleeding complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition:ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass (low-grade B-cell lymphoma) with anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses. She was readmitted to the ICU for sepsis, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 81 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 95/50 mmHg. She has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 9 mmHg.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 87,000/μL and is receiving platelet transfusions. She also has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL and is receiving red blood cell transfusions.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 4.1 mg/dL. She is receiving lasix and is being monitored for urine output.
* Electrolytes: The patient has electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia.
* Infection: The patient has a culture-positive infection with a high white blood cell count (WBC) and is receiving antibiotics.
* Nutritional: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and mechanically ventilated, but there is a risk of respiratory failure if the ventilator settings are not adjusted properly.
* Sepsis: The patient has a high WBC count and is receiving antibiotics, but there is a risk of sepsis if the infection is not adequately treated.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient is already receiving platelet transfusions, but there is a risk of bleeding if the platelet count does not improve.
* Anemia: The patient is receiving red blood cell transfusions, but there is a risk of transfusion reactions if the blood products are not properly screened.
* Acute renal failure: The patient is already receiving lasix and is being monitored for urine output, but there is a risk of worsening renal function if the treatment is not effective.
* Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications if not properly treated.
* Infection: The patient has a culture-positive infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death if not adequately treated.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is recommended that the patient continue to receive close monitoring and treatment in the ICU, with adjustments to her ventilator settings, antibiotics, and blood product transfusions as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**]):  Bronch yesterday showed
   minimal thin, frothy secretions.  Sputum gram stains with more than 25
   polys, no organisms.  BAL pending. Still with total body fluid
   overload, will need to remove fluid to start to move her towards
   weaning from ventilator support.  Now off pressors for more than 12
   hours.  Will hold on lasix drip until sure hct stable as below.
 HYPOTENSION:  In setting of hct drop was concerned about active
   bleeding albeit not clear this was the case as below.  On broad
   spectrum abx/ antifungals.  Repeat blood cultures sent through line
   given possibility of sepsis.
 ANEMIA:  No increased output from abdominal drains noted.   Right
   drain out.  Dressing clean and dry.  Abdomen a bit more distended
   today.  Hct bumped appropriately to transfusion.  Will follow today for
   evidence of blood loss.  Low threshold to repeat abdominal scan if hct
   decreases over the day.
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER: Hypokalemia, repleted this
   morning.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  Creatinine
   continues to improve albeit may see worsening in setting of transient
   hypotension albeit given transfusions and volume resusuitation,
   hopefully will avoid further insult.
 COAGULOPATHY:  Received vitamin K and FFP yesterday.  INR still
   elevated.  Will hold on further FFP as no evidence of active bleeding.
   Else agree with assessment and plan as per the medical resisdent's
   note.

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**]):  Bronch yesterday showed
   minimal thin, frothy secretions.  Sputum gram stains with more than 25
   polys, no organisms.  BAL pending. Still with total body fluid
   overload, will need to remove fluid to start to move her towards
   weaning from ventilator support.  Now off pressors for more than 12
   hours.  Will hold on lasix drip until sure hct stable as below.
 HYPOTENSION:  In setting of hct drop was concerned about active
   bleeding albeit not clear this was the case as below.  On broad
   spectrum abx/ antifungals.  Repeat blood cultures sent through line
   given possibility of sepsis.
 ANEMIA:  No increased output from abdominal drains noted.   Right
   drain out.  Dressing clean and dry.  Abdomen a bit more distended
   today.  Hct bumped appropriately to transfusion.  Will follow today for
   evidence of blood loss.  Low threshold to repeat abdominal scan if hct
   decreases over the day.
 ELECTROLYTE & FLUID DISORDER, OTHER: Hypokalemia, repleted this
   morning.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  Creatinine
   continues to improve albeit may see worsening in setting of transient
   hypotension albeit given transfusions and volume resusuitation,
   hopefully will avoid further insult.
 COAGULOPATHY:  Received vitamin K and FFP yesterday.  INR still
   elevated.  Will hold on further FFP as no evidence of active bleeding.
   Else agree with assessment and plan as per the medical resisdent's
   note.

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 55 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a POD #2, post-abdominal wound unpacking and closure, with respiratory failure and acute kidney injury. The patient is currently ventilator-dependent with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 99%. The patient has a history of anemia, hypokalemia, and coagulopathy.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 80 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 105/54 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 99%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.2 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 67.1 cells per microliter (cells/μL)
* Platelet count: 100 cells per microliter (cells/μL)
* Creatinine: 5.0 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.04 ng/mL
* Troponin-T: 0.04 ng/mL
* Albumin: 2.2 g/dL
* LDH: 521 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.2 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient's bronchoscopy showed minimal thin, frothy secretions, and sputum gram stains showed more than 25 polys, no organisms. The patient is still ventilator-dependent and needs to be weaned off the ventilator support.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals. Repeat blood cultures have been sent through the line given the possibility of sepsis.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin is low, and the patient has been transfused with packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets.
* Electrolyte and fluid disorder, other: The patient has hypokalemia, which was repleted this morning.
* Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient's creatinine continues to improve, but may worsen in the setting of transient hypotension.
* Coagulopathy: The patient received vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma yesterday, and the INR is still elevated. Further fresh frozen plasma will be held off unless there is evidence of active bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further ventilator dependence and increased risk of pneumonia.
* Sepsis: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated white blood cell count may indicate sepsis, which could lead to further organ dysfunction.
* Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and anemia may increase the risk of bleeding, which could be life-threatening.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to further electrolyte and fluid imbalances.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and electrolyte imbalances may increase the risk of cardiovascular instability, which could lead to cardiac arrest.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these complications and improve their clinical outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass with anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis. She is currently in the ICU on day 3 post-operative, with a diagnosis of sepsis, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. She has been weaned off pressors and is afebrile, with stable WBC count and heart rate in the 80s. She has a net negative fluid balance overnight and is being diuresed with Lasix to improve compliance. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, but she has a slight increase in alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin. Her platelet count is stable, and she has a normal coagulation profile. Her creatinine level is improving, and she is being closely monitored for renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen if she develops a secondary infection or if her antibiotics are ineffective.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute hypoxemic respiratory failure may progress to ARDS if her oxygenation and ventilation requirements increase.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's AKI may worsen if she continues to have a net negative fluid balance or if her creatinine level increases.
4. Liver Dysfunction: The patient's LFTs may worsen if she has a prolonged period of hypotension or if she develops a secondary liver injury.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile may worsen if she develops a secondary bleeding disorder or if her INR increases.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she has a prolonged period of bleeding or if she develops a secondary anemia.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if she has a prolonged period of bleeding or if she develops a secondary thrombocytopenia.
8. Cecal Mass Recurrence: The patient's cecal mass may recur if her lymphoma is not effectively treated or if she develops a secondary tumor.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's sepsis, respiratory function, and kidney function closely.
2. Adjust the patient's antibiotics and vasopressors as needed to manage her sepsis and hypotension.
3. Continue to diurese the patient with Lasix to improve her fluid balance and kidney function.
4. Monitor the patient's LFTs and coagulation profile closely and adjust her medications as needed.
5. Consider transfusing the patient with blood products if her platelet count or hemoglobin level decreases.
6. Follow up with the patient's oncologist to discuss her treatment options and monitor her response to therapy.
7. Continue to provide nutrition and glycemic control as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent surgery for a cecal mass and developed anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal abscesses. She was readmitted to the ICU for sepsis, anemia, coagulopathy, and worsening leukocytosis. She has been treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and blood transfusions. Her current medications include vancomycin, caspofungin, meropenem, and metronidazole.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is not fully controlled, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not managed properly.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is not fully corrected, and there is a risk of further bleeding and organ dysfunction if not managed properly.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is not fully corrected, and there is a risk of further bleeding and organ dysfunction if not managed properly.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is not fully corrected, and there is a risk of further bleeding and organ dysfunction if not managed properly.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is not fully reversed, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not managed properly.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of further infection due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of intra-abdominal abscesses.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient is at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to her anemia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of respiratory failure due to her sepsis, anemia, and coagulopathy.
9. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient is at risk of cardiovascular complications due to her sepsis, anemia, and coagulopathy.
10. Malignancy: The patient's AML is not fully controlled, and there is a risk of further progression and recurrence if not managed properly.

Based on these potential medical complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration and ensure optimal outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -PICC was confirmed placed on [**9-27**]
   -TPN continued
   -ID recommended caspo for fungal coverage despite rising LFTs (they
   thought LFT's were [**1-4**] shock liver) but surgery doesn't want this at
   this time.
   -Lasix gtt was started and titrated up to 2mg /hr as pressures were
   holding and pt needed help increasing her diuresis- K is being
   aggressively repleted while she is on the gtt.
   -FiO2 was reduced to 40% (still on CMV, assist/control)
   -Hct holding stable
   -Vanco level in am based on level

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: The patient's temperature is 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate is 81 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure is 100/52 mmHg, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 17 mmHg, and cardiac output is not mentioned.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,291 mL of fluids and lost 2,480 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -189 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 72.8 K/uL, platelet count is 79 K/uL, and lactate level is 1.7 mmol/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low calcium level of 8.2 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and the patient is receiving mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory acidosis.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient's urine output is not mentioned in the progress note.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low calcium level. This may lead to muscle weakness, cramping, or cardiac arrhythmias.
* Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics, and there is a risk of antibiotic-associated diarrhea or other side effects.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, and there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level is not mentioned in the progress note, but the patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids, which may affect glucose control.

Based on the patient's current condition, further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or manage potential complications. The patient's response to treatment should be closely monitored, and adjustments to therapy should be made as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy and a right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass with anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis. She is currently in the ICU on day 3 post-op from wound closure and washout.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the 80s, and she is afebrile. Her white blood cell count is stable, and she is off pressors. Her respiratory status is improving, with a reduction in FiO2 to 40% overnight.

The patient's laboratory results show improving liver function tests (LFTs), but slightly increased alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin. Her hematocrit is stable, and her platelet count is stable. Her coagulation studies show a normal international normalized ratio (INR).

The patient's fluid balance is negative, with a net loss of 189 mL overnight. Her creatinine is improving, and she is diuresing well on a Lasix drip.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying condition and fluid overload.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine is improving, but she may still be at risk for acute kidney injury due to her underlying condition and fluid overload.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation studies show a normal INR, but she may still be at risk for coagulopathy due to her underlying condition and the use of anticoagulant medications.
4. Infection: The patient's sepsis is resolving, but she may still be at risk for infection due to her underlying condition and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
5. Hemorrhage: The patient's platelet count is stable, but she may still be at risk for hemorrhage due to her underlying condition and the use of anticoagulant medications.

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be stable, but she may still be at risk for various medical complications. Close monitoring and management of her condition are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   I saw and examined the patient with the medical ICU resident, reviewed
   24 hour events and was present during key portions of services
   provided.  Continues off pressors. Patient continued to diurese on
   lasix drip overnight, negative ~2.2 L up to midnight last night,
   negative 630 cc since midnight. Continues intubated, critically ill.
   Secretions minimal via ETT.  Sedation off since 9 am. Lungs clear
   anterolaterally, dependent crackles, dimished breath sounds on right
   base.  Abdomen soft, staples in tact, no surrounding
   erythema/discharge.  Edema slightly better. Tolerating aggressive
   diuresis from a hemodynamically stable, Cr continues to improve,
   repleting electrolytes as needed.  Persistent coagulopathy, received
   vit K yesterday.  More awake off sedation, ABG improved on the PSV.  As
   she becomes more alert will  do SBT later today.  Wil discuss with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 2149**].  Total time spent 45 minutes.  Agree with assessment and plan
   as per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1538**]

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis: The patient's cecal mass and anastomotic leak can lead to ongoing sepsis, which can worsen the patient's condition.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute hypoxemic respiratory failure can worsen, leading to increased respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is negative, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy can worsen, leading to increased bleeding risk and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen, leading to increased creatinine levels and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can worsen, leading to increased bleeding risk and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Increased liver enzymes: The patient's increased liver enzymes can indicate liver damage or failure, which can worsen the patient's condition.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance can worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and potentially life-threatening complications.
10. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing sepsis can worsen, leading to multi-organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.

The patient's medical history, current medications, and laboratory results suggest that they are at risk for these complications. It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or mitigate these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy and a right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass due to anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis. The patient is currently in the ICU, three days post-operative, with ongoing sepsis, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 105/52 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via endotracheal tube at 40% FiO2 and is on assist control ventilation. The patient's respiratory support is being weaned, and the team is considering transitioning to pressure support ventilation.

The patient's fluid balance is negative, with a net loss of 2,246 mL, and the plateaus have increased from 25 to 27 cmH2O. The patient is receiving diuretic therapy with furosemide (Lasix) at 2 mg/hour and is being repleted with electrolytes aggressively.

The patient's laboratory results show stable white blood cell count, improving transaminases, and stable hemoglobin and platelet counts. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.9, and the team is considering the use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and/or vitamin K if the INR worsens.

The patient's acute kidney injury is improving, with a creatinine level of 4.1 mg/dL, and the patient is receiving diuretic therapy to promote urine output. The patient's cecal mass pathology is consistent with low-grade B-cell lymphoma, and the team is following up with oncology recommendations.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is being weaned, and the team is considering transitioning to pressure support ventilation. The patient may experience respiratory failure if the weaning process is not done carefully.
2. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing sepsis, and the team needs to monitor the patient's temperature, white blood cell count, and other laboratory results to ensure that the sepsis is resolving.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is improving, but the team needs to continue monitoring the patient's creatinine level and urine output to ensure that the injury is resolving.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, and the team needs to monitor the patient's INR and consider the use of FFP and/or vitamin K if the INR worsens.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable, but the team needs to continue monitoring the patient's hemoglobin level and transfusing blood products as necessary to maintain a hemoglobin level greater than 25%.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is stable, but the team needs to continue monitoring the patient's platelet count and transfusing blood products as necessary to maintain a platelet count greater than 50,000/μL.
7. Cecal mass recurrence: The patient's cecal mass pathology is consistent with low-grade B-cell lymphoma, and the team needs to follow up with oncology recommendations to ensure that the patient receives appropriate treatment for the cancer.

Overall, the patient is stable, but the team needs to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory and cardiovascular status to ensure that the patient's condition does not deteriorate."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass with anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) on day 6 after wound closure and washout. The patient remains off pressors and afebrile, with a stable white blood cell count and heart rate in the 80s.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

* Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring continued diuresis and potential adjustment of respiratory support
* Fluid imbalance, with a negative balance of 3.8 liters overnight, requiring continued diuresis and electrolyte repletion
* Increased liver function tests (LFTs), potentially due to a lag effect from prior hypotensive episode
* Anemia, with a stable hemoglobin level and ongoing transfusion
* Thrombocytopenia, with a stable platelet count and ongoing transfusion
* Coagulopathy, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.9 and ongoing monitoring
* Acute renal failure, with improved creatinine levels and ongoing diuresis

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory failure requires continued close monitoring and potential adjustment of respiratory support.
* Fluid overload: The patient's negative fluid balance and ongoing diuresis may lead to fluid overload, which can exacerbate respiratory failure and other medical complications.
* Hepatic dysfunction: The patient's increased LFTs may indicate ongoing liver damage, which can lead to complications such as coagulopathy and encephalopathy.
* Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of ongoing transfusions.
* Renal dysfunction: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
* Infection: The patient's ongoing sepsis and intra-abdominal infection may lead to further complications, such as organ failure and septic shock."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass due to anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis. She is currently in the ICU on day 6 post-wound closure and washout.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F (36.9°C), heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/63 mmHg. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 379 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Her oxygen saturation is 99%, and her respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 36.6 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 11.5 g/dL
* Platelet count (PLT): 77 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 3.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 24 mg/dL
* Serum electrolytes: Na+ 137 mmol/L, K+ 4.2 mmol/L, Cl- 110 mmol/L
* Glucose: 92 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.7 mmol/L

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Sepsis, which is resolving
* Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation
* Fluid balance, which is negative 3.8 L overnight
* Increased liver function tests (LFTs), which are improving
* Anemia, which is stable
* Thrombocytopenia, which is stable
* Coagulopathy, which is being monitored
* Acute renal failure, which is improving

The patient's plan includes:

* Weaning sedation and discussing with surgery for potential extubation
* Discussing with surgery for I/O goal and fluid balance
* Repleting electrolytes aggressively
* Trending LFTs and checking for acid-base status
* Serial Hct and transfusion for Hct <25
* Serial PLT checks and transfusion
* Trending INR and monitoring UOP
* Renally dosing meds and avoiding nephrotoxins
* Following up with oncology for AML and cecal mass

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis worsening
* Respiratory failure
* Fluid overload
* Acute kidney injury
* Liver failure
* Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Coagulopathy
* Anemia
* Metabolic acidosis due to lactic acidosis

The patient's code status is full, and her disposition is to continue on the hospital's ICU unit."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass due to anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) on day 6 post-operative.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 102 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 165/77 mmHg. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40% and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of amylase and lipase, with values of 279 and 575, respectively. Her white blood cell count is 35.0 x 10^9/L, and her platelet count is 68 x 10^9/L. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are 24 and 2.7 mg/dL, respectively, indicating acute kidney injury.

The patient's medical conditions include shock, respiratory failure, altered nutrition, electrolyte and fluid disorder, abdominal pain, and acute renal failure. She is also at risk for sepsis, as evidenced by her elevated white blood cell count and fever curve.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results to ensure that her condition is stable and improving.
2. Adjustments to her fluid and electrolyte management to prevent further complications.
3. Weaning of sedation as tolerated and discussion with the medicine and surgery teams regarding extubation.
4. Repleting electrolytes as needed and monitoring for signs of further worsening of her hematoma.
5. Serial platelet checks and transfusions as necessary.
6. Trending of her INR and monitoring for signs of further bleeding.
7. Monitoring of her urine output and adjusting her medication regimen to avoid nephrotoxins.
8. Follow-up with the hematology-oncology team regarding her AML and cecal mass.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever curve, she is at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, which is above the normal range, and her RSBI is 98, indicating that she is at risk for further respiratory compromise.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's BUN and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute kidney injury. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Hematoma: The patient's platelet count is 68 x 10^9/L, which is below the normal range. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further worsening of her hematoma.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is 1.8, which is above the normal range. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's sepsis is resolving, but the possibility of septic shock remains, especially with the elevated WBC count and fever curve.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and the RSBI of 98 indicates that the patient may still be at risk for respiratory complications.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is improving, but the risk of acute renal failure remains, especially with the patient's history of anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, such as potassium, magnesium, and phosphate, may be imbalanced due to the ongoing fluid overload and diuresis.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, and the risk of bleeding complications remains, especially with the patient's history of thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, especially with the ongoing bleeding and transfusion requirements.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, especially with the ongoing bleeding and transfusion requirements.
8. AML and Cecal Mass: The patient's AML and cecal mass may recur, especially with the patient's history of leukocytosis and known MDS.
9. DM 2: The patient's DM 2 may worsen, especially with the ongoing hyperglycemia and lack of adequate glycemic control.
10. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload remains a concern, especially with the ongoing diuresis and lack of adequate fluid management.

In terms of the patient's current status, the following findings are notable:

* The patient's WBC count is stable, and the fever curve is improving.
* The patient's HR is in the 80s, and the patient is afebrile.
* The patient's RSBI is 98, indicating ongoing respiratory failure.
* The patient's creatinine level is improving, but the risk of acute renal failure remains.
* The patient's electrolyte levels, such as potassium, magnesium, and phosphate, may be imbalanced due to the ongoing fluid overload and diuresis.
* The patient's INR is elevated, and the risk of bleeding complications remains.
* The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may worsen, especially with the ongoing bleeding and transfusion requirements.

Based on these findings, the patient's plan of care should include:

* Continued monitoring of the patient's vital signs, including WBC count, fever curve, and HR.
* Ongoing respiratory support, including CPAP/PSV and Fentanyl.
* Continued diuresis and fluid management to address fluid overload.
* Monitoring of the patient's electrolyte levels and correction of any imbalances.
* Monitoring of the patient's INR and correction of any bleeding complications.
* Serial hct and platelet checks to monitor anemia and thrombocytopenia.
* Ongoing management of the patient's AML and cecal mass, including follow-up with Heme/Onc and Onc.
* Ongoing management of the patient's DM 2, including ISS and accuchecks.
* Ongoing monitoring of the patient's fluid status and correction of any fluid overload."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass due to anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis. She is currently in the ICU for acute respiratory failure, shock, and electrolyte imbalance. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, and blood pressure of 165/77 mmHg. She has a central venous catheter, arterial line, and femoral arterial line in place. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lipase, and amylase levels, as well as decreased platelet count. She is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and analgesics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is currently stable, but there is a risk of progression or recurrence.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance is being managed with aggressive repletion, but there is a risk of further imbalance.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is improving, but there is a risk of further deterioration.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is being managed with serial platelet checks and transfusions, but there is a risk of further worsening.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is being managed with vitamin K, but there is a risk of further bleeding.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is being managed with serial hemoglobin checks and transfusions, but there is a risk of further worsening.
8. Increased Liver Enzymes: The patient's increased liver enzymes are being monitored, but there is a risk of further elevation.
9. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain is being managed with pain medication, but there is a risk of further worsening.
10. Anastomotic Leak: The patient's anastomotic leak is being managed with antibiotics and drainage, but there is a risk of further leakage.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass with anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis. She is currently in the ICU on day 8 post-operative, with a diagnosis of sepsis, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She has been off pressors and antibiotics since the previous day. Her WBC count is improving, and she remains off antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 123 bpm, and blood pressure of 189/92 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV with a FiO2 of 40%. Her laboratory results show improving WBC count, stable Hct, and stable platelet count.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is currently resolving, but she is still at risk for further complications.
2. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with CPAP/PSV, but she may require further intervention if her respiratory status deteriorates.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is improving, but she may still require further management to prevent further kidney damage.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, but she may require further transfusions if her Hct level drops below 25.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is stable, but she may require further transfusions if her platelet count drops below 50.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is stable, but she may require further monitoring to prevent bleeding complications.
7. AML and Cecal Mass: The patient's AML and cecal mass are being managed by the hematology/oncology team, and she may require further treatment to prevent recurrence.
8. DM 2: The patient's blood glucose levels are stable, but she may require further monitoring and management to prevent hyperglycemia.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-inch tall individual who weighs 87.4 kg, with a body mass index (BMI) of 34.3. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 390 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The patient's heart rate (HR) is 123 bpm, with a blood pressure (BP) of 189/92 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 99% on 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, with a total fluid input of 4,287 mL and a total fluid output of 4,336 mL.

The patient has a history of shock, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, alteration in nutrition, electrolyte and fluid disorder, abdominal pain, and renal failure. The patient is receiving treatment for these conditions, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and fluid resuscitation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and the risk of respiratory failure is high. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on 40% FiO2, which may indicate a degree of hypoxia. The patient's peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 11 cmH2O, which may indicate increased airway resistance.
2. Shock: The patient's blood pressure is 189/92 mmHg, which may indicate hypertension. The patient's central venous pressure is 8 mmHg, which may indicate hypovolemia. The patient's lactate level is 1.4 mmol/L, which may indicate tissue hypoperfusion.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 2.4 mg/dL, which may indicate acute renal failure. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 21 mEq/L, which may indicate azotemia.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient's sodium level is 143 mEq/L, which may indicate hypernatremia. The patient's potassium level is 4.8 mEq/L, which may indicate hypokalemia. The patient's chloride level is 59 mg/dL, which may indicate hypochloremia.
5. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain may indicate a gastrointestinal source of sepsis, which may worsen the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity is impaired, which may increase the risk of infection and sepsis.
7. Nutrition: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, which may worsen the patient's overall condition.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The patient requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to address the underlying causes of their illness."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy and a right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass due to anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal sepsis.
* She is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation and has been off pressors for 24 hours.
* Her WBC count is stable, and she is afebrile with a heart rate in the 80s.
* She has minimal drainage from her JP drains and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids.

**Potential Complications:**

* **Sepsis:** Although the patient is currently off pressors, there is still a risk of sepsis given her recent history of intra-abdominal sepsis and anastomotic leak.
* **Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but there is a risk of further deterioration given her underlying AML and recent surgery.
* **Fluid Balance:** The patient's net fluid balance is even, but there is still a risk of fluid overload given her recent surgery and potential sepsis.
* **Increased LFTs:** The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, but there is still a risk of further liver damage given her recent hypotensive episode and potential sepsis.
* **Anemia:** The patient's hemoglobin level is stable, but there is still a risk of further anemia given her recent blood loss and potential ongoing bleeding.
* **Thrombocytopenia:** The patient's platelet count is stable, but there is still a risk of further thrombocytopenia given her recent surgery and potential sepsis.
* **Coagulopathy:** The patient's INR is stable, but there is still a risk of further coagulopathy given her recent surgery and potential sepsis.
* **Acute Renal Failure:** The patient's creatinine level is improving, but there is still a risk of further renal damage given her recent surgery and potential sepsis.
* **AML and Cecal Mass:** There is still a risk of recurrence of the cecal mass given the patient's underlying AML and recent surgery.
* **DM 2:** The patient's blood sugar levels are stable, but there is still a risk of further hyperglycemia given her recent surgery and potential sepsis.

**Recommendations:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
* Maintain a close eye on the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels to prevent fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
* Continue to trend the patient's LFTs and adjust treatment accordingly.
* Monitor the patient's hemoglobin and platelet levels and transfuse as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's INR and adjust treatment accordingly.
* Monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust treatment accordingly.
* Follow up with the oncology team to discuss the patient's AML and cecal mass.
* Continue to monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and adjust treatment accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and electrolyte imbalances. They are currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, as well as diuretic therapy to manage fluid overload. Their electrolyte levels are being monitored and replaced as necessary. The patient's nutritional needs are being met through total parenteral nutrition (TPN). They are also receiving prophylactic measures to prevent deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and they are at risk for further deterioration, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which could lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased risk of mortality.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and they are at risk for further decline, which could lead to chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, or even death.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are being closely monitored, but they are at risk for further imbalances, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to their prolonged hospitalization, invasive lines and tubes, and compromised immune system.
5. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal function is compromised, and they are at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and other complications.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional needs are being met through TPN, but they are at risk for deficiencies in essential nutrients, which could lead to further complications.
8. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin is at risk for breakdown due to prolonged immobility and compromised circulation.

It is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to anticipate and address potential complications promptly and effectively."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent right hemicolectomy and hematoma evacuation. The patient has been in the ICU for 9 days and has been experiencing shock, respiratory failure, altered nutrition, electrolyte and fluid disorders, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 157/66 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula and has been successfully extubated.

The patient's laboratory results show an improving white blood cell count, but the patient is still experiencing thrombocytopenia. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, but the patient is not experiencing any current interventions. The patient's hematocrit is stable, and the patient is not requiring transfusions.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a heart rate of 83 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 157/66 mmHg.

The patient's renal function is improving, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL. The patient is not experiencing any signs of further worsening of the hematoma.

The patient's electrolyte levels are stable, with a potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, sodium level of 142 mmol/L, and chloride level of 103 mmol/L. The patient's blood glucose level is 162 mg/dL, and the patient is receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

The patient's medication list includes lasix, insulin, and antibiotics. The patient is also receiving parenteral nutrition and has a central line, arterial line, and femoral line.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the presence of an intra-abdominal hematoma and the patient's immunocompromised state.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to the presence of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the patient's underlying lung disease.
* Renal failure: The patient is at risk for renal failure due to the presence of acute kidney injury and the patient's underlying kidney disease.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient is at risk for electrolyte imbalance due to the presence of an intra-abdominal hematoma and the patient's underlying kidney disease.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient is at risk for thrombocytopenia due to the presence of an intra-abdominal hematoma and the patient's underlying bone marrow disease.
* Coagulopathy: The patient is at risk for coagulopathy due to the presence of an intra-abdominal hematoma and the patient's underlying liver disease.

In conclusion, the patient is a 75-year-old female with AML who underwent right hemicolectomy and hematoma evacuation. The patient is experiencing shock, respiratory failure, altered nutrition, electrolyte and fluid disorders, and acute renal failure. The patient is at risk for sepsis, respiratory failure, renal failure, electrolyte imbalance, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. The patient's laboratory results show an improving white blood cell count, but the patient is still experiencing thrombocytopenia. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, but the patient is not experiencing any current interventions. The patient's hematocrit is stable, and the patient is not requiring transfusions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patient has been extubated since yesterday morning and is doing well. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, and blood pressure of 155/64 mmHg.

The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure, which has been managed with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and spontaneous ventilation. The patient's respiratory support has been adjusted, with a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 25 mEq/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, sodium level of 140 mEq/L, and chloride level of 110 mEq/L.

The patient has a history of anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL and a hematocrit level of 33.3%. The patient's platelet count is within normal limits, with a level of 68 K/uL.

The patient's abdominal examination is normal, with soft and non-tender abdomen and present bowel sounds. The patient's extremities are warm and without edema.

The patient's neurologic examination is normal, with the patient being attentive and following simple commands.

The patient has a history of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has been ruled out. The patient's D-dimer level is elevated at 5744 ng/mL, indicating the presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's plan includes continued monitoring of their respiratory and cardiac status, as well as management of their electrolyte and fluid imbalances. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate, leading to hypoxia and hypercapnia.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's kidney function can worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): The patient's DIC can worsen, leading to bleeding and organ failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient can develop sepsis, leading to organ failure and death.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
6. Abdominal complications: The patient can develop abdominal complications, such as abscesses, perforation, or bleeding.
7. Neurologic complications: The patient can develop neurologic complications, such as seizures, stroke, or encephalopathy.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy and a right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass due to anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma. She is currently in the ICU on day 10 post-operative and is being treated for sepsis, intra-abdominal hematoma, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, and blood pressure of 132/55 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy at 3L NC and has a SpO2 of 100%. Her respiratory support is being monitored, and her fluid balance is being closely monitored to achieve a goal of -2L today.

Laboratory results show an improving WBC count, stable Hct, and stable platelet count. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, but trending downward. Her creatinine level is improving, and her urine output is good.

The patient's medical history includes AML, cecal mass, anastomotic leak, intra-abdominal hematoma, and DM2. She has a history of allergies to lisinopril and aspirin.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis due to her ongoing infection and the presence of an intra-abdominal hematoma.
2. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient's intra-abdominal hematoma could potentially develop into an abscess, which could lead to further complications.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute hypoxemic respiratory failure could progress to ARDS, which could lead to respiratory failure.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure could worsen and progress to AKI, which could lead to end-stage renal disease.
5. Liver failure: The patient's elevated LFTs could indicate liver failure, which could lead to liver failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy could worsen and lead to bleeding complications.
7. Recurrence of AML: The patient's history of AML and the presence of leukocytosis could indicate a recurrence of the disease, which could lead to further complications.

Overall, the patient is at risk for developing various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a hemicolectomy for a cecal mass with anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma. She is currently in the ICU on day 10 post-operatively, with resolving sepsis and off pressors. Her WBC count is improving, and she is off antibiotics since October 3rd.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: She remains extubated and is receiving 3L NC oxygen.
2. Fluid Balance: She has a negative fluid balance of -2L yesterday and -1L overnight, with a goal of -2L today. Her electrolytes are being repleted as needed.
3. Increased LFTs: Her alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels have peaked, potentially due to a lag effect from prior hypotensive episode.
4. Thrombocytopenia: Her platelet count is stable, and there are no signs of further worsening of the hematoma.
5. Coagulopathy: Her INR is stable at 1.6, and will be trending.
6. Acute Renal Failure: Her creatinine level is improving, and she will be monitored for UOP, renal dosing of medications, and avoidance of nephrotoxins.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma may worsen, leading to further sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure may progress, requiring reintubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia may worsen, increasing the risk of bleeding and hematoma expansion.
4. Acute renal failure may progress, requiring dialysis and potentially affecting medication dosing and electrolyte management.
5. Leukemia recurrence is a concern, and the patient will require follow-up with oncology.
6. Diabetes management may be affected by changes in glucose levels and medication dosing.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Maintain a negative fluid balance and replete electrolytes as needed.
3. Trend LFTs and monitor for signs of worsening liver dysfunction.
4. Monitor platelet count and INR, and adjust anticoagulation therapy as needed.
5. Continue to monitor renal function and adjust medication dosing and electrolyte management accordingly.
6. Follow up with oncology to assess for leukemia recurrence and plan for further treatment.
7. Monitor for signs of worsening sepsis and adjust antibiotic therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a hemicolectomy for a cecal mass with anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma. She is currently in the ICU on day 10 post-operative.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 99.2°F (37.3°C), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 132/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 3L nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC) increasing from 22.7 to 24.5
* Hematocrit (Hct) decreasing from 34.4 to 33.3
* Platelet count (Plt) stable at 68
* Creatinine (Cr) decreasing from 2.1 to 1.9
* Troponin-T (TnT) increasing from 0.04 to 0.04
* Lactic acid (Lac) stable at 1.4 mmol/L
* Albumin (Alb) stable at 2.4 g/dL
* LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) increasing from 731 IU/L to 731 IU/L

The patient's medications include:

* TPN with lipids
* Protonix (pantoprazole) for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Heparin for DVT prophylaxis
* PPI (proton pump inhibitor) for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Lasix (furosemide) for fluid management

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing to monitor for sepsis and adjusting antibiotics as necessary
* Maintaining good oxygen saturation and respiratory support
* Repleting electrolytes as needed
* Trending liver function tests (LFTs) and adjusting medication as necessary
* Monitoring platelet count and adjusting transfusions as necessary
* Trending INR and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as necessary
* Monitoring renal function and adjusting medication as necessary
* Following up with hematology/oncology for further management of AML

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Liver failure
* Thrombocytopenia and bleeding
* Coagulopathy and bleeding
* Recurrence of AML
* Development of secondary infections"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a complex medical condition. They have a history of shock, respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and electrolyte imbalance. The patient has a Dobhoff tube in place for nutrition and has been started on TPN with lipids. They have a PICC line and a multi-lumen line in place for medication administration. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have ongoing issues with fluid balance, electrolyte imbalances, and abdominal pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and they are at risk for further deterioration. Pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and respiratory distress syndrome are potential complications.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's kidney function is compromised, and they are at risk for further deterioration. Acute tubular necrosis, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease are potential complications.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and they are at risk for further imbalance. Hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypercalcemia are potential complications.
4. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is ongoing, and they are at risk for further complications such as perforation, abscess formation, and sepsis.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to their compromised immune system and the presence of invasive lines and tubes. Sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ failure are potential complications.
6. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is compromised, and they are at risk for further overload. Pulmonary edema, cardiac failure, and cerebral edema are potential complications.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's nutrition is compromised, and they are at risk for further malnutrition. Malnutrition can lead to muscle wasting, weakness, and impaired wound healing.
8. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk for pressure ulcers due to their prolonged immobility and compromised skin integrity. Pressure ulcers can lead to infection, sepsis, and further compromise of the patient's condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass due to anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma. The patient is currently in the ICU on day 11 post-surgery.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
* Heart rate: 88 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 124/61 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Stable

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 24.5 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 33.3%
* Platelet count: 68 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* Liver function tests: Elevated ALT and AST, but trending down
* Coagulation studies: International normalized ratio (INR) 1.5, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 30.0 seconds

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Sepsis: Afebrile, off pressors, WBC improving
* Intra-abdominal hematoma: Stable, no current intervention
* Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: Remains extubated, good oxygen saturation
* Fluid balance: -300 mL yesterday, lasix gtt remains off
* Increased liver function tests: Potentially due to prior hypotensive episode-shock liver
* Thrombocytopenia: Stable overnight, no signs of further worsening of hematoma
* Coagulopathy: Stable at 1.5
* Acute renal failure: Good urine output yesterday, creatinine continues to improve
* AML and cecal mass: Followed by Heme/Onc during admission
* DM 2: Well-controlled, followed by endocrinology

The patient's medications include:

* TPN with lipids
* Antibiotics (off since October 3)
* Lasix gtt (off)
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring WBC count and fever curve
* Continuing to trend liver function tests
* Monitoring platelet count and coagulation studies
* Monitoring urine output and creatinine levels
* Renally dosing medications and avoiding nephrotoxins
* Following up with oncology for AML and cecal mass
* Continuing to monitor for signs of sepsis and intra-abdominal hematoma

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Intra-abdominal abscess or fistula
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Liver failure
* Thrombocytopenia and bleeding
* Coagulopathy and bleeding
* Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Respiratory failure
* Neurological complications (e.g., seizures, stroke)

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy and a right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass with anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma. She is currently in the 11th post-operative day (POD) and is recovering from wound closure and washout.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 88 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 124/61 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 24 inspirations per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC) improving
* Hemoglobin (Hct) stable
* Platelet count (Plt) stable
* Creatinine (Cr) improving
* Liver function tests (LFTs) showing slight increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, but stable overall
* Coagulation profile showing a stable international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5
* Electrolytes within normal range

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: NAD (normal appetite and diet)
* Eyes and conjunctiva: mildly icteric
* Cardiovascular: S1S2 (normal heart sounds)
* Respiratory: clear anteriorly, decreased dependently
* Abdominal: soft, mildly tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: trace edema in lower extremities, no edema in upper extremities
* Skin: warm
* Neurologic: attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, movement not assessed, tone not assessed

The patient's medical conditions and complications include:

* Sepsis: afebrile, off pressors, WBC improving, cultures NGTD
* Intra-abdominal hematoma: stable, no current intervention
* Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure: remains extubated, good O2 sat on RA
* Fluid balance: -300 mL yesterday, lasix gtt remains off, I/O today, repleting electrolytes PRN, PM lytes
* Increased LFTs: TB slightly up today, potentially a lag effect from prior hypotensive episode-shock liver
* Thrombocytopenia: stable overnight, no signs of further worsening of hematoma
* Coagulopathy: stable at 1.5
* Acute renal failure: good UOP yesterday, creatinine continues to improve
* AML and cecal mass: followed by Heme/Onc during admission, initial concern for recurrence given leukocytosis
* DM 2: well-controlled, FS in mid 100's

The patient's plan includes:

* Monitoring WBC count and fever curve
* Off antibiotics since [**2177-10-3**]
* JP drains out, ostomy draining well, no drainage from Penrose, Pigtail
* Continue to monitor intra-abdominal hematoma
* Continue to trend LFTs
* Monitor UOP and renal function
* Renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins, check renal recs
* Follow-up with Onc
* ISS and accuchecks

The patient is currently in the ICU and will be discussed with [**Doctor First Name 91**] regarding when to move to the floor."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a hemicolectomy for a cecal mass with anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma. The patient has been in the ICU for 11 days post-operatively.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 124/61 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 3L nasal cannula.

The patient has been experiencing hyponatremia, which was corrected with half normal saline (NS). The patient also has a history of emesis, which was managed with Zofran.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC) increasing from 24.5 to 31.0
* Hematocrit (Hct) stable at 33.3%
* Platelet count (Plt) stable at 68
* Creatinine improving from 1.9 to 1.8 mg/dL
* Lactic acid levels stable at 1.4 mmol/L
* Electrolyte levels stable, with calcium (Ca++) at 8.0 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) at 2.8 mg/dL, and phosphorus (PO4) at 3.8 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Sepsis, which is resolving
* Intra-abdominal hematoma, which is stable
* Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is being managed with oxygen therapy
* Fluid imbalance, which is being managed with diuresis and electrolyte repletion
* Increased liver enzymes, which are being trended
* Thrombocytopenia, which is being monitored
* Coagulopathy, which is being trended
* Acute renal failure, which is being managed with diuresis and medication dosing

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing to monitor WBC count and fever curve
* Maintaining JP drains and ostomy drainage
* Continuing to trend liver enzymes and electrolytes
* Monitoring for signs of worsening hematoma
* Replenishing electrolytes as needed
* Managing fluid balance and diuresis
* Avoiding nephrotoxins and adjusting medication dosing as needed
* Following up with hematology/oncology for further evaluation and management of AML and cecal mass

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening sepsis
* Hemorrhage from the intra-abdominal hematoma
* Respiratory failure
* Renal failure
* Liver failure
* Coagulopathy
* Thrombocytopenia
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Infection from JP drains and ostomy

Based on the patient's current status and plan, it is essential to continue to monitor and manage the patient's conditions closely to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-inch tall adult who was admitted to the ICU with a history of multi-lumen stop and has been receiving various medications and treatments. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 124/61 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with an SpO2 of 98% and no oxygen delivery device.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their condition, but they are responding to stimuli and have no signs of skin or neurologic abnormalities. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and troponin-T, indicating possible inflammation and cardiac damage.

The patient's medical conditions include shock, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, alteration in nutrition, electrolyte and fluid disorder, abdominal pain, and acute renal failure. The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase levels suggest possible sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels indicate possible cardiac damage, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if not properly managed, leading to respiratory acidosis and eventually respiratory arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen if not properly managed, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and eventually end-stage renal disease.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abdominal pain and elevated liver enzymes suggest possible gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and multi-organ failure.
6. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and altered nutrition increase the risk of infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and worsen the patient's condition.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte and fluid disorder can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory failure if not properly managed.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the best possible outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent surgery for a cecal mass and had an anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being managed for various medical complications.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is extubated and has good oxygen saturation on room air.
* Cardiovascular: The patient is stable, with no signs of shock or cardiac compromise.
* Neurological: The patient is attentive and follows simple commands, with no signs of altered mental status.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has abdominal pain, but it is not severe. The ostomy is draining well, and the patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with lipids.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL. The patient is receiving fluids and medications to manage the condition.
* Hepatic: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, with a total bilirubin level of 7.5 mg/dL. The patient is receiving liver-directed therapy and is being monitored for signs of liver failure.
* Coagulation: The patient has a coagulopathy, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5. The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy and is being monitored for signs of bleeding.
* Hematological: The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 62,000/uL. The patient is receiving platelet transfusions as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis due to the presence of an intra-abdominal hematoma and the patient's immunocompromised state.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for developing respiratory failure due to the presence of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and the patient's underlying lung disease.
* Renal failure: The patient is at risk for developing renal failure due to the presence of acute renal failure and the patient's underlying kidney disease.
* Liver failure: The patient is at risk for developing liver failure due to the presence of elevated liver enzymes and the patient's underlying liver disease.
* Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to the presence of a coagulopathy and the patient's underlying bleeding disorder.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to the presence of an intra-abdominal hematoma and the patient's immunocompromised state.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications. The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy and right hemicolectomy for a cecal mass due to anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple medical issues.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 77 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 145/54 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase and transaminases, which may be due to chronic pancreatitis or liver disease. Her pancreatic enzymes, including amylase and lipase, are also elevated. Her white blood cell count is stable at 22.7 K/μL, and her platelet count is 70 K/μL.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is at risk for developing septic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and may require mechanical ventilation.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure and may require dialysis.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count and is at risk for bleeding.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR), which may increase her risk of bleeding.
6. Pancreatitis: The patient has chronic pancreatitis and may develop acute pancreatitis, which could lead to further complications.
7. Liver disease: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and may have underlying liver disease, which could worsen her condition.
8. Intra-abdominal hematoma: The patient has a history of intra-abdominal hematoma and may develop further complications, such as bleeding or infection.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continued monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Administration of antibiotics to prevent sepsis.
3. Mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function.
4. Dialysis to manage her acute renal failure.
5. Platelet transfusions to support her thrombocytopenia.
6. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to correct her coagulopathy.
7. Pain management to alleviate her abdominal pain.
8. Nutrition support, including total parenteral nutrition (TPN), to provide adequate caloric intake.
9. Close monitoring of her fluid balance to prevent further complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical issues to prevent further complications and improve her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a complex medical history, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a recent hemicolectomy for an anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple medical complications.

The patient's condition is complicated by:

1. Sepsis: Although she is afebrile and off pressors, she remains at risk for sepsis due to her underlying conditions and the presence of NG tubes and drains.
2. Pancreatitis: Her pancreatic enzymes are still climbing, and she may require further treatment to manage this condition.
3. Liver dysfunction: Her liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, and she may have an underlying liver condition, such as a stone or pancreatitis, which could be contributing to her symptoms.
4. Thrombocytopenia: Her platelet count is low, which may be related to her underlying medical conditions or treatment.
5. Coagulopathy: Her international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated, which may be related to her liver dysfunction or other underlying conditions.
6. Acute renal failure: Her creatinine level is elevated, and she may require further treatment to manage this condition.
7. Respiratory failure: She has acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and may require further respiratory support.
8. Abdominal pain: She has ongoing abdominal pain, which may be related to her underlying conditions or treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient may develop septic shock, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient may develop further complications from pancreatitis, such as abscesses or pseudocysts.
3. Liver dysfunction: The patient may develop liver failure, which can lead to coagulopathy, bleeding, and death.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient may develop further bleeding complications due to her low platelet count.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient may develop further bleeding complications due to her elevated INR.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient may develop further kidney damage or failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and other complications.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient may develop further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
8. Abdominal pain: The patient may develop further abdominal complications, such as abscesses or perforation.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her multiple medical complications to prevent further deterioration and improve her overall outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Problems
   Complicated bowel anatomy (see operations above)
   Low bicarbonate
          This was previously dominantly a respiratory alkalosis, but
   HCO3 has continued to fall.
          Check ABG, ULytes, ostomy lytes and then evaluate further
          TPN is low-chloride already
   Liver disease
          Appears mostly cholestatic.  However, holding TPN is a major
   issue in this patient.
          Appreciate hepatology
s input
   Ferritin > Assay
          Ask lab to dilute
          Discuss with hepatology: does she have hemochromatosis?
   Could this help explain her pancreatitis?

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent hemicolectomy for a cecal mass and developed anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma. She has been in the ICU for 13 days and has been treated for sepsis, acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and acute renal failure. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with a peak total bilirubin (TB) of 8.1, but are currently stable. Her ferritin level is elevated to 3303, and her liver specialist is unsure if it is due to hemochromatosis or Still's disease. She has a history of diabetes, which is well-controlled.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatotoxicity: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, and she is at risk of developing liver damage due to the chemotherapy and potential liver disease.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated ferritin level and liver function tests may indicate pancreatitis, which could worsen her condition.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute hypoxemic respiratory failure could worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or cardiac arrest.
4. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis could worsen, leading to multi-organ failure.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure could worsen, leading to end-stage renal disease.
6. Hemorrhage: The patient's thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy make her at risk of bleeding, which could worsen her condition.
7. Intra-abdominal complications: The patient's anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma could worsen, leading to further complications such as peritonitis or abscesses.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and poor nutritional intake could lead to malnutrition, which could worsen her condition.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and ferritin level closely to assess for potential liver damage or pancreatitis.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's sepsis and treat accordingly.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and provide supportive care as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and bleeding risk and provide platelet transfusions as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's intra-abdominal status and provide supportive care as needed.
7. Provide nutritional support to the patient to prevent malnutrition.
8. Consider consulting a gastroenterologist or hepatologist to assess the patient's liver function and provide guidance on potential treatment options."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-inch tall, 87.2 kg male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, unknown origin. He has a history of chronic pancreatitis, and has been experiencing impaired physical mobility and altered nutrition. He is currently receiving TPN with lipids and has a PICC line in place. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 127/57 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 100%. His lab results show a white blood cell count of 21.6, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 69 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and unknown origin of infection may lead to sepsis, which can cause organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's chronic pancreatitis may worsen, leading to further complications such as pancreatic necrosis or abscess formation.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or need for mechanical ventilation.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to end-stage renal disease or the need for dialysis.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or seizures.
6. Shock: The patient's shock may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
7. Infection: The patient's impaired physical mobility and altered nutrition may increase his risk of developing infections, such as pressure ulcers or pneumonia.
8. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen, leading to increased agitation, confusion, and risk of falls or other injuries."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent a hemicolectomy for a cecal mass with anastomotic leak and intra-abdominal hematoma. She is currently in the ICU on day 14 post-operative, with a history of resolving sepsis. Her current condition is stable, with no fever, pain, or chills. Laboratory results show elevated amylase and lipase levels, suggesting pancreatitis, but with no signs of worsening. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are slightly elevated, and she has a potential diagnosis of hemochromatosis. She has a non-gap metabolic acidosis, and her fluid balance is being closely monitored. Her platelet count is stable, and she has no signs of worsening of her intra-abdominal hematoma.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase and lipase levels suggest pancreatitis, which could worsen if not managed properly.
2. Hemochromatosis: The patient's elevated ferritin levels and potential diagnosis of hemochromatosis could lead to further liver damage and fibrosis if not managed.
3. Non-gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's decreased bicarbonate levels and normal anion gap suggest a non-gap metabolic acidosis, which could worsen if not treated.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's stable creatinine levels and good urine output suggest that she is at risk for acute renal failure if her fluid balance is not closely monitored.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's stable platelet count is a concern, as thrombocytopenia can worsen and lead to bleeding complications if not managed properly.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's stable international normalized ratio (INR) is a concern, as coagulopathy can worsen and lead to bleeding complications if not managed properly.
7. Intra-abdominal hematoma: The patient's stable intra-abdominal hematoma is a concern, as it could worsen and lead to further complications if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results, particularly her amylase and lipase levels, to ensure that her pancreatitis is not worsening.
2. Manage the patient's non-gap metabolic acidosis by administering bicarbonate supplements and monitoring her urine output.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels to ensure that she is not at risk for acute renal failure.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and coagulation status to ensure that she is not at risk for bleeding complications.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's intra-abdominal hematoma and consider further imaging or intervention if it worsens.
6. Consult with the patient's oncologist to discuss her treatment plan and potential risks and complications.
7. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist or hepatologist to discuss the patient's potential diagnosis of hemochromatosis and management options."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Heart rate: 93 beats per minute (bpm) with a range of 85-109 bpm
* Blood pressure: 124/65 mmHg with a range of 119/49-140/70 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 inspirations per minute (insp/min) with a range of 18-38 insp/min
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's lab results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.8 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 21.6-25.9 K/uL
* Platelet count: 65-72 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.5-1.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 100-124 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 117-144 mEq/L, potassium 4.4-4.8 mEq/L, chloride 25.0-33.3 mEq/L
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* D-dimer: 5744 ng/mL

The patient has a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis, and is at risk for complications such as pancreatitis, pancreatic abscess, and sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Pancreatitis: The patient's chronic pancreatitis puts them at risk for recurrent episodes of pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic abscess, sepsis, and multi-organ failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and D-dimer levels suggest that they may be at risk for sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and their oxygen saturation is 97%, which suggests that they may be at risk for respiratory failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, which suggests that they may be at risk for acute renal failure.
5. Electrolyte and fluid disorders: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and they are receiving TPN with lipids, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
6. Shock: The patient's blood pressure is low, and they have a diagnosis of shock, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
7. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is a symptom of their chronic pancreatitis, and can lead to complications such as pancreatitis, pancreatic abscess, and sepsis.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including pancreatitis, sepsis, respiratory failure, renal failure, electrolyte and fluid disorders, shock, and abdominal pain."
