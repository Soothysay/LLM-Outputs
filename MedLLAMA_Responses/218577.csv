   Imaging: [**2146-11-9**] Renal US: no hydronephrosis or acute process. small
   to mod ascites
   .
   [**2146-11-9**] CT head: no acute process
   .
   [**2146-11-7**]: 1. Decrease in size of the soft tissue mass over the right
   anterior chest wall which is invading into the sternum and the right
   anterior ribs. Decrease in the epidural soft tissue enhancing mass at
   L3. Decrease in size of soft tissue nodule in the right abdomen
   subcutaneous fat.
   2. Unchanged peritoneal deposits seen in the right upper quadrant and
   in the nephrectomy bed. More extensive ascites within the abdomen, and
   new bilateral small pleural effusions.
   3. Increase in size of peritoneal mass in the right upper quadrant with
   decreased enhancement compared to [**2146-8-15**] CT. WIth the regression of
   other disease this could reflect ongoing hemorrhage and necrosis from
   recent chemotherapy, though this is uncertain.
   4. Diffuse thickening of the transverse colon with asymmetrical focal
   thickening of the wall of the proximal left colon. The pattern is
   unusual for inflammatory or infectious conditions and there is no
   nodularity to suggest that this is due to further metastatic spread.
   These findings could be related to chemotherapy but ischemic colitis is
   in the differential. SMA and [**Female First Name (un) **] are widely patent; mesenteric veins
   are not well evaluated on this CT due to the phase of scanning.
   5. Diffuse esophageal thickening suggests esophagitis.
   ECG: EKG: [**2146-11-9**] 14:10 Sinus at 62, LAD, RBBB. TWI in opposite
   direction of QRS. QRS 146 (up from 120 [**2146-5-20**]). No peaked T waves of P
   wave flattening. Qtc 479
   .
   EKG [**2146-11-9**] 1638: unchanged except QRS improved to 136, Qtc to 469.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents
   with N/V, ARF, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration,
   # Acute renal failure. CR of 9.5 from baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**].
   Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D
   and ongoing use of diuretics. Intrinsic component is likely, including
   ATN given recent dye load on [**11-7**]. The Sunitinib itself can cause
   acute renal failure as well (increased Cr reported in upto 66% of
   cases), as can gabapentin. In the setting of low plt and elevated LDH
   microangiopathic hemalytic anemia / DIC with end organ damage is also
   possible. Post renal less likely without hydro on renal US.
   - Aggressive IVF
   - foley, monitor UO
   - urine lytes
   - urine eos
   - spin urine
   - renal recs
   - hold sunitinib and gabapentin.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and Sodium polystyrene sulfonate. No BMs yet. Likely
   [**2-21**] ARF, also could be 2.2 sunitinib. Lysis from hemolytic anemia or
   necrotic CA (as suggested on CT) also possible
   - q4h K
   - HCO3 IVF
   - await Sodium polystyrene sulfonate effects
   - hold Sunitinib
   .
   #. Metabolic: Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis with
   lactate of 7.2 on presentation, lactic acidosis likely multifactorial
   with metformin administration, global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   decreased po intake also with local production from necrotic tissue in
   her abdomen.  CT scan from [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic
   peritoneal mass and possible mesenteric ischemia which could be
   contributing to a type B lactic acidosis, but mesenteric ischemia is
   much less likely given benign abdominal exam.  Delta-delta of 2.8 on
   presentation suggestive of underling metabolic alkalosis, likely from
   GI losses.
   - Patient received over 5L IVF o/n with minimal urine output, still c/o
   thirst will give more IVF this morning, 2L of LR and see if urine
   output increases and lactate decreases since it has risen again since
   the initial decrease to 5.8.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal infection with
   vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 67 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication induced or comsumptive
   process such as DIC or TMA.
   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the
   setting of any procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg
   for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia and sutent administration
   - zofran prn, pt npo for now
   - treat uremia
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc about possible rasburicase
   - also f/u with how much of her current presentation could be sutent
   related
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.
   - RISS for now, if she remains consistently in the 200
s will likely
   start an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN: Given clnical evidence of dyhydration hold all BP meds,
   especially [**Last Name (un) **] given hyperkalemia.
   - Trend BP
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met: Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now
   Glycemic Control:  regular insulin sliding scale
   Lines: 2 PIV
s for now, will like need some form of central access:
   triple lumen vs. HD line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D
   and ongoing use of diuretics. Intrinsic component is likely, including
   ATN given recent dye load on [**11-7**]. The Sunitinib itself can cause
   acute renal failure as well (increased Cr reported in upto 66% of
   cases), as can gabapentin. In the setting of low plt and elevated LDH
   microangiopathic hemalytic anemia / DIC with end organ damage is also
   possible. Post renal less likely without hydro on renal US.

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who was admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, lactic acidosis, and altered mental status. She has a history of nephrectomy and failed IL-2 treatment, and was recently treated with sunitinib. She is currently receiving IV fluids, insulin, and antibiotics, and is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is at risk for further deterioration in renal function.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, and she is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactic acid level is elevated, and she is at risk for further deterioration in her condition.
4. Infection: The patient's bandemia and altered mental status suggest the possibility of infection, which could be related to her underlying disease or a secondary complication.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she is at risk for bleeding.
6. Uremic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and asterixis suggest the possibility of uremic encephalopathy.
7. Mesenteric Ischemia: The patient's CT scan suggests the possibility of mesenteric ischemia, which could be a complication of her underlying disease or a secondary complication.
8. Colitis: The patient's CT scan suggests the possibility of colitis, which could be a complication of her underlying disease or a secondary complication.
9. DIC/Hemolytic Anemia: The patient's thrombocytopenia and bandemia suggest the possibility of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or hemolytic anemia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV fluids and insulin to manage acute renal failure and hyperkalemia.
2. Monitor the patient's potassium and creatinine levels closely to adjust treatment as needed.
3. Consider empirical coverage for infection with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusions if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider intubation if necessary.
6. Consider further imaging studies to evaluate for potential complications such as mesenteric ischemia or colitis.
7. Consider consulting a nephrologist or other specialists to assist with management of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents
   with N/V, ARF, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure. CR of 9.5 from baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**].
   Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D
   and ongoing use of diuretics, also likely a component of ATN from
   global hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given her recent
   CT with contrast.  No baseline labs prior to contrast so unclear what
   her renal function was prior to the scan.   Could also be related to
   Sunitinib which can cause acute renal failure as well (increased Cr
   reported in upto 66% of cases).
   - uric acid levels are very elevated, likely due to elevated uric acid
   from sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF, uric acid no longer
   being excreted, very concerning that the part of her functional kidney
   that is working could be injured by the large amount of uric acid in
   the blood.  Would favor using rasburicase to help bind the uric acid,
   will discuss the possibility with renal and onc.
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  renal ultrasound with no signs of obstruction
   - f/u urine eosinophils and electrolyte studies
   - renal following, appreciate recs
will discuss indications for HD

   # Hyperkalemia: K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and kayexelate.  Patient with BM overnight and K has
   decreased to 4.2 this morning.  Hyperkalemia most likely from renal
   failure, could also be a component of lysis from necrotic tumor in her
   abdomen.

   [**2146-11-9**] CT head: no acute process
   .
   [**2146-11-7**]: 1. Decrease in size of the soft tissue mass over the right
   anterior chest wall which is invading into the sternum and the right
   anterior ribs. Decrease in the epidural soft tissue enhancing mass at
   L3. Decrease in size of soft tissue nodule in the right abdomen
   subcutaneous fat.
   2. Unchanged peritoneal deposits seen in the right upper quadrant and
   in the nephrectomy bed. More extensive ascites within the abdomen, and
   new bilateral small pleural effusions.
   3. Increase in size of peritoneal mass in the right upper quadrant with
   decreased enhancement compared to [**2146-8-15**] CT. WIth the regression of
   other disease this could reflect ongoing hemorrhage and necrosis from
   recent chemotherapy, though this is uncertain.
   4. Diffuse thickening of the transverse colon with asymmetrical focal
   thickening of the wall of the proximal left colon. The pattern is
   unusual for inflammatory or infectious conditions and there is no
   nodularity to suggest that this is due to further metastatic spread.
   These findings could be related to chemotherapy but ischemic colitis is
   in the differential. SMA and [**Female First Name (un) **] are widely patent; mesenteric veins
   are not well evaluated on this CT due to the phase of scanning.
   5. Diffuse esophageal thickening suggests esophagitis.
   ECG: EKG: [**2146-11-9**] 14:10 Sinus at 62, LAD, RBBB. TWI in opposite

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents
   with N/V, ARF, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure. CR of 9.5 from baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**].
   Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D
   and ongoing use of diuretics, also likely a component of ATN from
   global hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given her recent
   CT with contrast.  No baseline labs prior to contrast so unclear what
   her renal function was prior to the scan.   Could also be related to
   Sunitinib which can cause acute renal failure as well (increased Cr
   reported in upto 66% of cases).
   - uric acid levels are very elevated, likely due to elevated uric acid
   from sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF, uric acid no longer
   being excreted, very concerning that the part of her functional kidney
   that is working could be injured by the large amount of uric acid in
   the blood.  Would favor using rasburicase to help bind the uric acid,
   will discuss the possibility with renal and onc.
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  renal ultrasound with no signs of obstruction
   - f/u urine eosinophils and electrolyte studies
   - renal following, appreciate recs
will discuss indications for HD
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and kayexelate.  Patient with BM overnight and K has
   decreased to 4.2 this morning.  Hyperkalemia most likely from renal
   failure, could also be a component of lysis from necrotic tumor in her
   abdomen.
   - continue to monitor q4h K
   - LR for IVF
s for now
   - renal following and appreciate recs, will continue to monitor in the
   event that she needs an HD intervention
   .
   #. Metabolic: Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis with
   lactate of 7.2 on presentation, lactic acidosis likely multifactorial
   with metformin administration, global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   decreased po intake also with local production from necrotic tissue in
   her abdomen.  CT scan from [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic
   peritoneal mass and possible mesenteric ischemia which could be
   contributing to a type B lactic acidosis, but mesenteric ischemia is
   much less likely given benign abdominal exam.  Delta-delta of 2.8 on
   presentation suggestive of underling metabolic alkalosis, likely from
   GI losses.
   - Patient received over 5L IVF o/n with minimal urine output, still c/o
   thirst will give more IVF this morning, 2L of LR and see if urine
   output increases and lactate decreases since it has risen again since
   the initial decrease to 5.8.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal infection with
   vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 67 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication induced or comsumptive
   process such as DIC or TMA.
   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the
   setting of any procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg
   for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia and sutent administration
   - zofran prn, pt npo for now
   - treat uremia
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc about possible rasburicase
   - also f/u with how much of her current presentation could be sutent
   related
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.
   - RISS for now, if she remains consistently in the 200
s will likely
   start an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN: Given clnical evidence of dyhydration hold all BP meds,
   especially [**Last Name (un) **] given hyperkalemia.
   - Trend BP-monitor for rebound hypertension in the setting of stopping
   clonidine
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met: Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications have arisen:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased significantly, and the patient has a pre-renal component likely due to poor oral intake, nausea, vomiting, and diuretic use. The patient's uric acid levels are also very elevated, which is a concern.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated, which is likely due to renal failure and possibly also related to lysis from necrotic tumor in the abdomen.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis with a lactate level of 7.2, which is likely multifactorial, including metformin administration, global hypoperfusion, and local production from necrotic tissue in the abdomen.
4. Bandemia: The patient has a bandemia, which suggests infection, and the most likely source is an intra-abdominal process, given the patient's nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased significantly, which is likely due to sepsis, sunitinib, medication-induced thrombocytopenia, or a consumptive process such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient is disoriented, with asterixis and hyper-reflexia, which is suggestive of uremia.
7. Nausea and Vomiting: The patient has ongoing nausea and vomiting, which is likely due to uremia and sunitinib administration.
8. Metabolic Derangements: The patient has multiple metabolic derangements, including hyperkalemia, lactic acidosis, and altered mental status, which are likely related to the patient's underlying renal cell cancer and its treatment.

   .
   [**2146-11-9**] CT head: no acute process
   .
   [**2146-11-7**]: 1. Decrease in size of the soft tissue mass over the right
   anterior chest wall which is invading into the sternum and the right
   anterior ribs. Decrease in the epidural soft tissue enhancing mass at
   L3. Decrease in size of soft tissue nodule in the right abdomen
   subcutaneous fat.
   2. Unchanged peritoneal deposits seen in the right upper quadrant and
   in the nephrectomy bed. More extensive ascites within the abdomen, and
   new bilateral small pleural effusions.
   3. Increase in size of peritoneal mass in the right upper quadrant with
   decreased enhancement compared to [**2146-8-15**] CT. WIth the regression of
   other disease this could reflect ongoing hemorrhage and necrosis from
   recent chemotherapy, though this is uncertain.
   4. Diffuse thickening of the transverse colon with asymmetrical focal
   thickening of the wall of the proximal left colon. The pattern is
   unusual for inflammatory or infectious conditions and there is no
   nodularity to suggest that this is due to further metastatic spread.
   These findings could be related to chemotherapy but ischemic colitis is
   in the differential. SMA and [**Female First Name (un) **] are widely patent; mesenteric veins
   are not well evaluated on this CT due to the phase of scanning.
   5. Diffuse esophageal thickening suggests esophagitis.
   ECG: EKG: [**2146-11-9**] 14:10 Sinus at 62, LAD, RBBB. TWI in opposite
   direction of QRS. QRS 146 (up from 120 [**2146-5-20**]). No peaked T waves of P

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents
   with N/V, ARF, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration,
   # Acute renal failure. CR of 9.5 from baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**].
   Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D
   and ongoing use of diuretics. Intrinsic component is likely, including
   ATN given recent dye load on [**11-7**]. The Sunitinib itself can cause
   acute renal failure as well (increased Cr reported in upto 66% of
   cases), as can gabapentin. In the setting of low plt and elevated LDH
   microangiopathic hemalytic anemia / DIC with end organ damage is also
   possible. Post renal less likely without hydro on renal US.
   - Aggressive IVF
   - foley, monitor UO
   - urine lytes
   - urine eos
   - spin urine
   - renal recs
   - hold sunitinib and gabapentin.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and Sodium polystyrene sulfonate. No BMs yet. Likely
   [**2-21**] ARF, also could be 2.2 sunitinib. Lysis from hemolytic anemia or
   necrotic CA (as suggested on CT) also possible
   - q4h K
   - HCO3 IVF
   - await Sodium polystyrene sulfonate effects
   - hold Sunitinib
   .
   #. Metabolic: Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis with
   lactate of 7.2. Differential for lactic acidosis includes renal
   failure, infection, metformin induced. CT scan from [**11-7**] also noted
   possible necrotic peritoneal mass and possible mesenteric ischemia
   which could be contributing to a type B lactic acidossis. However
   mesenteric ischemia is not supported on exam. Delta-delta of 2.8
   suggestive of underlinge metabolic alkalosis, likely from GI losses.
   - Aggressive IVF
   - trend ABG, lactate
   - hold metformin
   - empirically cover broadly for infection with vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   - serial abd exams
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 67 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication induced or comsumptive
   process such as DIC or TMA.
   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the
   setting of any procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg
   for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia and sutent administration
   - zofran prn, pt npo for now
   - treat uremia
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc about possible rasburicase
   - also f/u with how much of her current presentation could be sutent
   related
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.
   - RISS for now, if she remains consistently in the 200
s will likely
   start an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN: Given clnical evidence of dyhydration hold all BP meds,
   especially [**Last Name (un) **] given hyperkalemia.
   - Trend BP
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met: Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

1. The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, who presents with nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
2. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple metabolic derangements, including acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
3. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine (9.5 mg/dL), urea nitrogen (67 mg/dL), and potassium (6.7 mmol/L), as well as decreased platelet count (67,000/μL).
4. The patient's imaging studies, including CT scans, show evidence of tumor necrosis, ascites, and pleural effusions.
5. The patient's medical history is significant for previous nephrectomy, failed IL-2 therapy, and recent completion of a 28-day course of sunitinib.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to prolonged use of nephrotoxic medications and underlying renal cell carcinoma.
2. Hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias due to elevated potassium levels and potential cardiac toxicity of sunitinib.
3. Lactic acidosis and metabolic acidosis due to underlying kidney disease, sepsis, or medication-induced toxicity.
4. Infections, including intra-abdominal sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections, given the patient's immunocompromised state and recent chemotherapy.
5. Thrombocytopenia and bleeding diathesis due to decreased platelet count and potential platelet dysfunction.
6. Respiratory failure due to pleural effusions and potential lung metastases.
7. Gastrointestinal complications, including colitis, perforation, and hemorrhage, given the patient's history of chemotherapy and potential tumor necrosis.
8. Neurological complications, including seizures, coma, and stroke, due to underlying uremia, electrolyte imbalances, and potential medication toxicity.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to monitor her closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-inch tall, overweight/obese individual admitted to the ICU with elevated uric acid levels (17.7 mg/dL) and received 5L of IV fluids overnight with only 55cc of urine output. They were given another dose of D50 and insulin for elevated glucose levels. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 36.3°C, Tcurrent of 35.8°C, HR of 81 bpm, BP of 112/63 mmHg, RR of 12 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 93%. The patient's physical examination reveals soft, non-tender abdomen, and normal bowel sounds. The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and increased Cr levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's decreased Hct and increased Cr levels suggest AKI, which can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of sepsis.
2. Hyperuricemia: The patient's elevated uric acid levels can lead to acute kidney injury, acute gouty arthritis, and uric acid nephrolithiasis.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and increased Cr levels suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's decreased urine output and increased Cr levels suggest the possibility of respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications such as ARDS and increased mortality.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's decreased Hct and increased Cr levels suggest the possibility of cardiovascular complications such as cardiogenic shock, which can lead to further complications such as arrhythmias and increased mortality.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's asterixis and decreased mental status suggest the possibility of neurological complications such as encephalopathy, which can lead to further complications such as seizures and increased mortality.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Imaging: [**2146-11-9**] Renal US: no hydronephrosis or acute process. small
   to mod ascites
   .
   [**2146-11-9**] CT head: no acute process
   .
   [**2146-11-7**]: 1. Decrease in size of the soft tissue mass over the right
   anterior chest wall which is invading into the sternum and the right
   anterior ribs. Decrease in the epidural soft tissue enhancing mass at
   L3. Decrease in size of soft tissue nodule in the right abdomen
   subcutaneous fat.
   2. Unchanged peritoneal deposits seen in the right upper quadrant and
   in the nephrectomy bed. More extensive ascites within the abdomen, and
   new bilateral small pleural effusions.
   3. Increase in size of peritoneal mass in the right upper quadrant with
   decreased enhancement compared to [**2146-8-15**] CT. WIth the regression of
   other disease this could reflect ongoing hemorrhage and necrosis from
   recent chemotherapy, though this is uncertain.
   4. Diffuse thickening of the transverse colon with asymmetrical focal
   thickening of the wall of the proximal left colon. The pattern is
   unusual for inflammatory or infectious conditions and there is no
   nodularity to suggest that this is due to further metastatic spread.
   These findings could be related to chemotherapy but ischemic colitis is
   in the differential. SMA and [**Female First Name (un) **] are widely patent; mesenteric veins
   are not well evaluated on this CT due to the phase of scanning.
   5. Diffuse esophageal thickening suggests esophagitis.
   ECG: EKG: [**2146-11-9**] 14:10 Sinus at 62, LAD, RBBB. TWI in opposite
   direction of QRS. QRS 146 (up from 120 [**2146-5-20**]). No peaked T waves of P
   wave flattening. Qtc 479
   .
   EKG [**2146-11-9**] 1638: unchanged except QRS improved to 136, Qtc to 469.
   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents
   with N/V, ARF, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. CR of 9.5 from baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**].
   Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D
   and ongoing use of diuretics. Intrinsic component is likely, including
   ATN given recent dye load on [**11-7**]. The Sunitinib itself can cause
   acute renal failure as well (increased Cr reported in upto 66% of
   cases), as can gabapentin. In the setting of low plt and elevated LDH
   microangiopathic hemalytic anemia / DIC with end organ damage is also
   possible. Post renal less likely without hydro on renal US.
   - Aggressive IVF
   - foley, monitor UO
   - urine lytes
   - urine eos
   - spin urine
   - renal recs
   - hold sunitinib and gabapentin.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and Sodium polystyrene sulfonate. No BMs yet. Likely
   [**2-21**] ARF, also could be 2.2 sunitinib. Lysis from hemolytic anemia or
   necrotic CA (as suggested on CT) also possible
   - q4h K
   - HCO3 IVF
   - await Sodium polystyrene sulfonate effects
   - hold Sunitinib
   .
   #. Metabolic: Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis with
   lactate of 7.2. Differential for lactic acidosis includes renal
   failure, infection, metformin induced. CT scan from [**11-7**] also noted
   possible necrotic peritoneal mass and possible mesenteric ischemia
   which could be contributing to a type B lactic acidossis. However
   mesenteric ischemia is not supported on exam. Delta-delta of 2.8
   suggestive of underlinge metabolic alkalosis, likely from GI losses.
   - Aggressive IVF
   - trend ABG, lactate
   - hold metformin
   - empirically cover broadly for infection with vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   - serial abd exams
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and colonic
   findings on [**11-7**] CT.
   - Cover broadly for intraabdominal process with cefepime, vanco,
   flagyl.
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 84 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), gabapentin, or comsumption such as
   DIC or TMA.
   - hold sunitinib
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel.
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia given ARF. Altered MS [**2-21**] evolving sepsis also
   possible. CT head neg for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not rapidily improve
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia. underlying GI infection also possible.
   Med toxicity aslo possible. Abdominal mets could also be contributing.
   - zofran prn
   - treat uremia
   - Trend LFTs.
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertabrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - hold sunitinib
   - heme/onc consult in am.
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.
   - RISS while NPO
   .
   #. HTN: Given clnical evidence of dyhydration hold all BP meds,
   especially [**Last Name (un) **] given hyperkalemia.
   - Trend BP
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met: Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents
   with N/V, ARF, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   .
   # Acute renal failure. CR of 9.5 from baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**].
   Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D
   and ongoing use of diuretics. Intrinsic component is likely, including
   ATN given recent dye load on [**11-7**]. The Sunitinib itself can cause
   acute renal failure as well (increased Cr reported in upto 66% of
   cases), as can gabapentin. In the setting of low plt and elevated LDH
   microangiopathic hemalytic anemia / DIC with end organ damage is also
   possible. Post renal less likely without hydro on renal US.
   - Aggressive IVF

   #. Metabolic: Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis with
   lactate of 7.2. Differential for lactic acidosis includes renal
   failure, infection, metformin induced. CT scan from [**11-7**] also noted
   possible necrotic peritoneal mass and possible mesenteric ischemia
   which could be contributing to a type B lactic acidossis. However
   mesenteric ischemia is not supported on exam. Delta-delta of 2.8
   suggestive of underlinge metabolic alkalosis, likely from GI losses.
   - Aggressive IVF
   - trend ABG, lactate

   flagyl.
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection

1. The patient is a 57-year-old male with metastatic renal cell cancer, who presented with nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure (ARF), hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
2. The patient has been treated with Sunitinib, which can cause acute renal failure, and has also received IV fluids, insulin, and calcium gluconate to manage his electrolyte imbalances.
3. The patient's laboratory results show:
	* Elevated creatinine (9.5 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (67 mg/dL)
	* Hyperkalemia (K 6.7 mmol/L)
	* Lactic acidosis (lactate 7.2 mmol/L)
	* Thrombocytopenia (platelet count 63 x 10^9/L)
	* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (323 IU/L)
	* Abnormal liver function tests (ALT 12 IU/L, AST 33 IU/L)
4. The patient's imaging studies show:
	* Renal ultrasound: no hydronephrosis or acute process
	* CT head: no acute process
	* CT abdomen: metastatic disease to the liver, lung, and sternum, with possible necrotic peritoneal mass and mesenteric ischemia
5. The patient's physical examination shows:
	* Abnormal vital signs, including tachypnea and tachycardia
	* Abnormal neurological examination, including asterixis and hyper-reflexia
	* Abnormal abdominal examination, including diffuse thickening of the transverse colon and focal thickening of the wall of the proximal left colon

Potential medical complications that may arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening ARF, which may lead to further electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
2. Hyperkalemia, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
3. Lactic acidosis, which may lead to metabolic acidosis and further worsening of the patient's condition.
4. Thrombocytopenia, which may lead to bleeding complications.
5. Infection, which may be related to the patient's metastatic disease or other underlying conditions.
6. Ischemic colitis, which may be related to the patient's metastatic disease or other underlying conditions.
7. Metabolic alkalosis, which may be related to the patient's electrolyte imbalances.
8. DIC or TMA, which may be related to the patient's thrombocytopenia and other underlying conditions.

Based on these findings, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and other underlying conditions. He also requires further evaluation and treatment of his metastatic disease, including consideration of chemotherapy and other targeted therapies."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF,
   hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure.
   CR of 9.3, starting to trend back up since yesterday (baseline of 1.2
   on [**10-13**]). Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and
   presistent N/V/D and ongoing use of diuretics, also likely a component
   of ATN from global hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given
   her recent CT with contrast; could also be related to Sunitinib tx.  No
   eosinophils in urine.  FeNa 1.4% prior to lasix dose. FeUrea 19%
   - uric acid levels trending down, s/p rasburicase. were likely elevated
   secondary to sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  renal ultrasound with no signs of obstruction
   - renal following, appreciate recs
will discuss indications for HD ;
   Nephrology feels pt may not end up needing HD at this point
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:
   Improved, stable. K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and kayexelate.  Patient with BM overnight and K has
   decreased to 4.2 this morning.  Hyperkalemia most likely from renal
   failure, could also be a component of lysis from necrotic tumor in her
   abdomen.
   - continue to monitor q4h K
   - LR for IVF
s for now
   - renal following and appreciate recs, will continue to monitor in the
   event that she needs an HD intervention
   .
   #. Metabolic:
   Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis; gap decreased to 16;
   lactic acidosis likely multifactorial with metformin administration,
   global hypoperfusion in the setting of decreased po intake also with
   local production from necrotic tissue in her abdomen.  CT scan from
   [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic peritoneal mass and possible
   mesenteric ischemia which could be contributing to a type B lactic
   acidosis, but mesenteric ischemia is much less likely given benign
   abdominal exam.  Delta-delta of 2.8 on presentation suggestive of
   underling metabolic alkalosis, likely from GI losses.
   - Patient received over 5L IVF o/n with minimal urine output, still c/o
   thirst will give more IVF this morning, 2L of LR and see if urine
   output increases and lactate decreases since it has risen again since
   the initial decrease to 5.8.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal infection with
   vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 67 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication induced or comsumptive
   process such as DIC or TMA.
   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the
   setting of any procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg
   for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia and sutent administration
   - zofran prn, pt npo for now
   - treat uremia
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc about possible rasburicase
   - also f/u with how much of her current presentation could be sutent
   related
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.
   - RISS for now, if she remains consistently in the 200
s will likely
   start an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN: Given clnical evidence of dyhydration hold all BP meds,
   especially [**Last Name (un) **] given hyperkalemia.
   - Trend BP-monitor for rebound hypertension in the setting of stopping
   clonidine
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met: Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF,
   hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure.
   CR of 9.3, starting to trend back up since yesterday (baseline of 1.2
   on [**10-13**]). Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and
   presistent N/V/D and ongoing use of diuretics, also likely a component
   of ATN from global hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given
   her recent CT with contrast; could also be related to Sunitinib tx.  No
   eosinophils in urine.  FeNa 1.4% prior to lasix dose. FeUrea 19%
   - uric acid levels trending down, s/p rasburicase. were likely elevated
   secondary to sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  renal ultrasound with no signs of obstruction
   - renal following, appreciate recs

   # Hyperkalemia:
   Improved, stable. K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and kayexelate.  Patient with BM overnight and K has
   decreased to 4.2 this morning.  Hyperkalemia most likely from renal
   failure, could also be a component of lysis from necrotic tumor in her
   abdomen.
   - continue to monitor q4h K
   - LR for IVF
s for now
   - renal following and appreciate recs, will continue to monitor in the
   event that she needs an HD intervention
   .
   #. Metabolic:
   Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis; gap decreased to 16;
   lactic acidosis likely multifactorial with metformin administration,
   global hypoperfusion in the setting of decreased po intake also with
   local production from necrotic tissue in her abdomen.  CT scan from
   [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic peritoneal mass and possible
   mesenteric ischemia which could be contributing to a type B lactic
   acidosis, but mesenteric ischemia is much less likely given benign
   abdominal exam.  Delta-delta of 2.8 on presentation suggestive of
   underling metabolic alkalosis, likely from GI losses.
   - Patient received over 5L IVF o/n with minimal urine output, still c/o
   thirst will give more IVF this morning, 2L of LR and see if urine
   output increases and lactate decreases since it has risen again since
   the initial decrease to 5.8.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal infection with
   vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl

   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the

   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presents with acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis. She has a history of nausea and vomiting, decreased oral intake, and has received IV contrast, Sunitinib, and Metformin. The patient's metabolic derangements are likely due to a combination of factors, including Sunitinib administration, decreased oral intake, and IV contrast. The patient has a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, lactic acidosis, and hyperkalemia. She also has thrombocytopenia, bandemia, and altered mental status, which may be related to uremia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is 9.3 mg/dL, and her urine output is low. ARF can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiovascular complications.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is 4.2 mEq/L, which is still elevated despite treatment. Hyperkalemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and respiratory depression.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactic acid level is 3.2 mmol/L, which is elevated. Lactic acidosis can lead to metabolic acidosis, which can cause respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and altered mental status.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 58 K/uL, which is low. Thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding, especially in the setting of uremia.
5. Bandemia: The patient's band count is 12.0%, which suggests an infection. Bandemia can lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, which may be related to uremia, lactic acidosis, or electrolyte imbalances. Altered mental status can increase the risk of falls, aspiration, and other complications.
7. Infection: The patient has a high risk of infection due to her immunosuppressed state, uremia, and bandemia. Infection can lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and electrolyte levels closely.
2. Consider hemodialysis if the patient's renal function does not improve or if her mental status worsens.
3. Continue to treat the patient's hyperkalemia with calcium, insulin, and kayexalate.
4. Monitor the patient's lactate levels closely and consider adjusting her treatment accordingly.
5. Continue to treat the patient's thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's mental status closely and consider adjusting her treatment accordingly.
7. Consider empirically covering the patient for an intra-abdominal infection with vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's band count and consider adjusting her treatment accordingly.
9. Consider obtaining a CT scan of the abdomen to evaluate for an intra-abdominal process.
10. Consider consulting with a nephrologist and an oncologist to optimize the patient's care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF,
   hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure.
   CR of 9.3, essentially stable (baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**]). Pre-renal
   component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D and ongoing
   use of diuretics, also likely a component of ATN from global
   hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given her recent CT with
   contrast; could also be related to Sunitinib tx.  No eosinophils in
   urine.  FeNa 1.4% prior to lasix dose. FeUrea 19%. renal ultrasound
   with no signs of obstruction
   - uric acid levels trending down, s/p rasburicase. were likely elevated
   secondary to sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Will not likely need HD b/c no indications, except possible uremia ;
   no longer has hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis improving
   - unable to assess JVP; will check neck veins w ultrasound to determine
   fluid status
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   #. Metabolic Acidosis:
   Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis; gap decreased to 16;
   lactic acidosis likely multifactorial with metformin administration,
   global hypoperfusion in the setting of decreased po intake also with
   local production from necrotic tissue in her abdomen.  CT scan from
   [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic peritoneal mass and possible
   mesenteric ischemia which could be contributing to a type B lactic
   acidosis.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - continue to empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal
   infection with vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia:
   Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR negative. UA
   neg. GI source possible given N/V/D and findings on [**11-7**] CT.  Most
   concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in the setting of
   necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue broad coverage
   for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - follow diffs on CBC
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:
   Stable. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis, sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication
   induced or comsumptive process such as DIC or TMA, though unlikely TMA,
   per Renal.
   - given one dose of DDAVP yesterday in setting of possible line
   procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel daily, and prior to procedures ; fibrinogen
   stable
   .
   # Altered Mental status:
   Not completely oriented but when asked repeatedly will remember
   orientation questions; slow to respond sometimes. Asterixis and
   hyper-reflexic suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her
   ARF. CT head neg for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presents with acute renal failure (ARF), hyperkalemia, lactic acidosis, and multiple metabolic derangements. She was administered Sunitinib and Metformin, which likely contributed to her ARF and metabolic derangements. She was also given IV contrast, which worsened her renal function. Her current condition includes:

* Acute renal failure (CR 9.3)
* Hyperkalemia (24 mEq/L)
* Lactic acidosis (lactate level 3.2 mmol/L)
* Metabolic acidosis (anion gap 16)
* Thrombocytopenia (58 K/uL)
* Bandemia (71.0% neutrophils)
* Altered mental status (not completely oriented)
* Abdominal mass (4-5cm) in the right lower quadrant (RLQ)
* Yellow tint and patches of hypopigmentation on her skin

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of Acute Renal Failure: Continued administration of nephrotoxic medications, inadequate fluid management, and lack of improvement in renal function may lead to further deterioration of renal function.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: Failure to manage lactic acidosis and metabolic acidosis may lead to further acidosis, which can worsen respiratory and cardiovascular status.
3. Thrombocytopenia: Continued bleeding or platelet consumption may lead to worsening of thrombocytopenia, potentially resulting in bleeding complications.
4. Infection: Presence of bandemia and altered mental status increases the risk of infection, particularly intra-abdominal infection.
5. Uremic Encephalopathy: Continued elevation of BUN and creatinine may lead to worsening of altered mental status and potentially life-threatening uremic encephalopathy.
6. Hyperkalemia: Failure to manage hyperkalemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Abdominal Complications: Presence of abdominal mass and potential necrosis may lead to abdominal complications, such as perforation, abscess, or bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor and manage ARF, metabolic acidosis, and lactic acidosis.
2. Reassess and adjust medication dosing to avoid nephrotoxicity.
3. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for intra-abdominal infection.
4. Monitor platelet count and consider platelet transfusion if necessary.
5. Continue to trend lactate and anion gap to monitor metabolic acidosis.
6. Consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS acutely worsens.
7. Monitor for signs of infection, particularly intra-abdominal infection.
8. Consider ultrasound to determine fluid status and assess JVP.
9. Follow up with heme/onc recs and continue to manage DM, HTN, and back pain/L3 met."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF,
   hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure.
   CR of 9.3, starting to trend back up since yesterday (baseline of 1.2
   on [**10-13**]). Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and
   presistent N/V/D and ongoing use of diuretics, also likely a component
   of ATN from global hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given
   her recent CT with contrast; could also be related to Sunitinib tx.  No
   eosinophils in urine.  FeNa 1.4% prior to lasix dose. FeUrea 19%
   - uric acid levels trending down, s/p rasburicase. were likely elevated
   secondary to sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  renal ultrasound with no signs of obstruction
   - renal following, appreciate recs
will discuss indications for HD ;
   Nephrology feels pt may not end up needing HD at this point
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:
   Improved, stable. K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and kayexelate.  Patient with BM overnight and K has
   decreased to 4.2 this morning.  Hyperkalemia most likely from renal
   failure, could also be a component of lysis from necrotic tumor in her
   abdomen.
   - continue to monitor q4h K
   - LR for IVF
s for now
   - renal following and appreciate recs, will continue to monitor in the
   event that she needs an HD intervention
   .
   #. Metabolic: Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis with
   lactate of 7.2 on presentation, lactic acidosis likely multifactorial
   with metformin administration, global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   decreased po intake also with local production from necrotic tissue in
   her abdomen.  CT scan from [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic
   peritoneal mass and possible mesenteric ischemia which could be
   contributing to a type B lactic acidosis, but mesenteric ischemia is
   much less likely given benign abdominal exam.  Delta-delta of 2.8 on
   presentation suggestive of underling metabolic alkalosis, likely from
   GI losses.
   - Patient received over 5L IVF o/n with minimal urine output, still c/o
   thirst will give more IVF this morning, 2L of LR and see if urine
   output increases and lactate decreases since it has risen again since
   the initial decrease to 5.8.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal infection with
   vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 67 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication induced or comsumptive
   process such as DIC or TMA.
   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the
   setting of any procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg
   for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia and sutent administration
   - zofran prn, pt npo for now
   - treat uremia
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF,
   hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure.
   CR of 9.3, starting to trend back up since yesterday (baseline of 1.2
   on [**10-13**]). Pre-renal component likely given poor PO intake and
   presistent N/V/D and ongoing use of diuretics, also likely a component
   of ATN from global hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given
   her recent CT with contrast; could also be related to Sunitinib tx.  No
   eosinophils in urine.  FeNa 1.4% prior to lasix dose. FeUrea 19%
   - uric acid levels trending down, s/p rasburicase. were likely elevated
   secondary to sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  renal ultrasound with no signs of obstruction
   - renal following, appreciate recs
will discuss indications for HD ;
   Nephrology feels pt may not end up needing HD at this point
   .
   # Hyperkalemia:
   Improved, stable. K 6.7 at arrival improved to 5.5 after Caclium,
   D50/insulin, HCO3, and kayexelate.  Patient with BM overnight and K has
   decreased to 4.2 this morning.  Hyperkalemia most likely from renal
   failure, could also be a component of lysis from necrotic tumor in her
   abdomen.
   - continue to monitor q4h K
   - LR for IVF
s for now
   - renal following and appreciate recs, will continue to monitor in the
   event that she needs an HD intervention
   .
   #. Metabolic: Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis with
   lactate of 7.2 on presentation, lactic acidosis likely multifactorial
   with metformin administration, global hypoperfusion in the setting of
   decreased po intake also with local production from necrotic tissue in
   her abdomen.  CT scan from [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic
   peritoneal mass and possible mesenteric ischemia which could be
   contributing to a type B lactic acidosis, but mesenteric ischemia is
   much less likely given benign abdominal exam.  Delta-delta of 2.8 on
   presentation suggestive of underling metabolic alkalosis, likely from
   GI losses.
   - Patient received over 5L IVF o/n with minimal urine output, still c/o
   thirst will give more IVF this morning, 2L of LR and see if urine
   output increases and lactate decreases since it has risen again since
   the initial decrease to 5.8.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal infection with
   vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR
   negative. UA neg. GI source most likely given N/V/D and findings on
   [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in
   the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue
   broad coverage for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: 67 down from 167 in [**9-28**]. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis,
   sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication induced or comsumptive
   process such as DIC or TMA.
   - inspite of platelet count over 50,000 since she is uremic her
   platelets are not functionally normal, so will give DDAVP in the
   setting of any procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel at least daily, and prior to procedures
   .
   # Altered Mental status: disoriented. Asterixis and hyper-reflexic
   suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her ARF. CT head neg
   for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   - f/u CT head final read
   .
   # N/V: Most likely [**2-21**] uremia and sutent administration
   - zofran prn, pt npo for now
   - treat uremia

   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presents with acute renal failure (ARF), hyperkalemia, lactic acidosis, and altered mental status. She has a history of nausea and vomiting, decreased oral intake, and hypoperfusion, which likely contributed to her metabolic derangements. She has been treated with various medications, including vancomycin, metronidazole, furosemide, and sunitinib, which may have contributed to her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is 9.3 mg/dL, and her urine output is decreased, indicating a high risk of ARF. Further monitoring of her renal function and fluid balance is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is 4.2 mmol/L, which is still elevated despite treatment. Continued monitoring and management of her electrolyte levels are necessary to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactate level is 7.2 mmol/L, which is elevated and may indicate a high risk of lactic acidosis. Further management of her metabolic derangements is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
4. Infection: The patient's bandemia and altered mental status suggest a high risk of infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and further monitoring and management of her infection is necessary.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 67 x 10^9/L, which is low and may indicate a high risk of bleeding. Further monitoring and management of her platelet count is necessary to prevent bleeding.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be related to uremia, lactic acidosis, or infection. Further monitoring and management of her mental status is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
7. Nausea and Vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may be related to her underlying condition or medications. Further management of her nausea and vomiting is necessary to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and fluid balance to prevent further deterioration.
2. Continue to manage the patient's hyperkalemia and lactic acidosis with close monitoring of her electrolyte levels.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's infection and adjust her antibiotic therapy as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and platelet count to prevent bleeding.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's altered mental status and adjust her management accordingly.
6. Continue to manage the patient's nausea and vomiting to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Consider consulting with a nephrologist and/or an oncologist to further manage the patient's condition.

ICU Care:

1. Nutrition: The patient should receive total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to provide adequate nutrition and prevent malnutrition.
2. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels should be closely monitored and managed to prevent hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.
3. Lines: The patient's lines should be monitored regularly to prevent infection and ensure proper function.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient should receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection, and stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent stress ulcers.
5. DVT: The patient should receive prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
6. Stress Ulcer: The patient should receive stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent stress ulcers.
7. VAP: The patient should receive ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis to prevent VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF,
   hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure.
   CR of 9.3, essentially stable (baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**]). Pre-renal
   component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D and ongoing
   use of diuretics, also likely a component of ATN from global
   hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given her recent CT with
   contrast; could also be related to Sunitinib tx.  No eosinophils in
   urine.  FeNa 1.4% prior to lasix dose. FeUrea 19%. renal ultrasound
   with no signs of obstruction
   - uric acid levels trending down, s/p rasburicase. were likely elevated
   secondary to sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Will not likely need HD b/c no indications, except possible uremia ;
   no longer has hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis improving
   - unable to assess JVP; will check neck veins w ultrasound to determine
   fluid status
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   #. Metabolic Acidosis:
   Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis; gap decreased to 16;
   lactic acidosis likely multifactorial with metformin administration,
   global hypoperfusion in the setting of decreased po intake also with
   local production from necrotic tissue in her abdomen.  CT scan from
   [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic peritoneal mass and possible
   mesenteric ischemia which could be contributing to a type B lactic
   acidosis.
   - trend lactate
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - continue to empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal
   infection with vanc, cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia:
   Suggestive of infection in setting of lactic acidosis. CXR negative. UA
   neg. GI source possible given N/V/D and findings on [**11-7**] CT.  Most
   concerning for an intra-abdominal process especially in the setting of
   necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor, so will continue broad coverage
   for an intra-abdominal process with vanc/cefepime/flagyl
   - follow diffs on CBC
   - f/u cultures
   - stool cult for c diff, bac, o+p, and viral infection given recent
   diarrhea and concern for colitis on CT scan
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:
   Stable. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis, sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication
   induced or comsumptive process such as DIC or TMA, though unlikely TMA,
   per Renal.
   - given one dose of DDAVP yesterday in setting of possible line
   procedure
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   - DIC / hemolysis panel daily, and prior to procedures ; fibrinogen
   stable
   .
   # Altered Mental status:
   Not completely oriented but when asked repeatedly will remember
   orientation questions; slow to respond sometimes. Asterixis and
   hyper-reflexic suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her
   ARF. CT head neg for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc recs
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.  Stable on insulin sliding scale now
   - RISS for now;  if she is consistently in the 200
s will likely start
   an insulin gtt
   .
   #. HTN:  BPs labile into 150s and 160s sometimes.
   - Hold BP meds for now
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met:   Pt not asking for pain meds
   - Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who has developed multiple medical complications, including:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is 9.3 mg/dL, and she has a pre-renal component likely due to poor oral intake and persistent nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient's uric acid levels were elevated, but are now trending down after administration of rasburicase.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactic acidosis caused by metformin administration, global hypoperfusion, and local production from necrotic tissue in her abdomen. The patient's lactate level is being trended, and metformin has been discontinued.
3. Bandemia: The patient has a white blood cell count of 14.0 K/uL, which is suggestive of infection. The patient's urine analysis is negative, and her CXR is negative. The most concerning source of infection is an intra-abdominal process, given the patient's recent CT scan findings of necrosis of her intra-abdominal tumor.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is stable, and the differential diagnosis includes sepsis, sunitinib, medication-induced or consumptive process such as DIC or TMA.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is not completely oriented but can remember orientation questions when asked repeatedly. Asterixis and hyper-reflexia are suggestive of uremia, especially in the setting of her ARF.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is 7.5 mg/dL, which is elevated. However, it is being managed with diuretics and electrolyte replacement.
7. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is labile and has been as high as 182/107 mmHg.
8. Lactic Acidosis: The patient has a lactic acid level of 3.2 mmol/L, which is elevated. The patient's lactate level is being trended, and metformin has been discontinued.
9. Renal Cell Cancer: The patient has metastatic renal cell carcinoma, which has progressed to her lung, sternum, and L3 vertebrae.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of ARF, leading to uremia and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Development of sepsis or septic shock due to ongoing infection.
3. Progression of lactic acidosis, leading to metabolic acidosis and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Development of DIC or TMA, which can exacerbate thrombocytopenia and bleeding.
5. Worsening of hyperkalemia, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Development of electrolyte imbalances, such as hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, or hyperphosphatemia, which can exacerbate ARF and other medical complications.
7. Progression of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, leading to further organ involvement and potentially life-threatening complications.

Given the patient's complex medical status, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   57 y/o with metastatic renal cell CA presents with N/V, ARF,
   hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis.
   --Patient
s multiple metabolic derangements likely started with sutent
   administration, which led to nausea/vomiting, decreased po intake and
   with continued administration of metformin all led to global decreased
   perfusion and increased lactate production.  Her decreased intake and
   hypoperfusion worsened her renal function, which was also likely
   worsened by IV contrast administration, leading to all of her
   electrolyte abnormalities.
   # Acute renal failure.
   CR of 9.3, essentially stable (baseline of 1.2 on [**10-13**]). Pre-renal
   component likely given poor PO intake and presistent N/V/D and ongoing
   use of diuretics, also likely a component of ATN from global
   hypoperfusion and contrast induced nephropathy given her recent CT with
   contrast; could also be related to Sunitinib tx.  No eosinophils in
   urine.  FeNa 1.4% prior to lasix dose. FeUrea 19%. renal ultrasound
   with no signs of obstruction
   - Cr down to 7.5 from peak of 9.3
   - uric acid levels trending down, s/p rasburicase. were likely elevated
   secondary to sutent therapy and in the setting of ARF
   - renally dose all medications and avoid nephrotoxins
   -  Will not likely need HD b/c no indications, except possible uremia ;
   no longer has hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis improving, continue
   to monitor mental status
   - unable to assess JVP; will check neck veins w ultrasound to determine
   fluid status
   - renal following, appreciate recs
   .
   #. Metabolic Acidosis:
   Multiple processes. Anion GAP metabolic acidosis; gap decreased to 16;
   lactic acidosis likely multifactorial with metformin administration,
   global hypoperfusion in the setting of decreased po intake also with
   local production from necrotic tissue in her abdomen.  CT scan from
   [**11-7**] also noted possible necrotic peritoneal mass and possible
   mesenteric ischemia which could be contributing to a type B lactic
   acidosis.
   - trend lactate
has been coming down, continue IV fluids
   - metformin discontinued and should not be restarted in the setting of
   profound lactic acidosis
   - continue to empirically cover broadly for likely intra-abdominal
   infection with cefepime, flagyl.
   .
   #. Bandemia: resolved, but was suggestive of infection in setting of
   lactic acidosis. CXR negative. UA neg. GI source possible given N/V/D
   and findings on [**11-7**] CT.  Most concerning for an intra-abdominal
   process especially in the setting of necrosis of her intra-abdominal
   tumor
   - will d/c vancomycin and continue cefepime/flagyl for total of 10 day
   course, today is [**3-29**]
   - follow diffs on CBC
   - f/u cultures
all with NGTD
   - stool viral cult pending, remainder are negative
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia:
   Stable. Ddx is [**2-21**] sepsis, sunitinib (reported 65% of time), medication
   induced or comsumptive process such as DIC or TMA, though unlikely TMA,
   per Renal.
   - DDAVP with procedures
   - trend plt, replete if bleeding or plt < 10
   .
   # Altered Mental status: currently oriented to self, place and month
   but not year or president
   Not completely oriented but when asked repeatedly will remember
   orientation questions; slow to respond sometimes. Asterixis and
   hyper-reflexic suggestive of uremia especially in the setting of her
   ARF. CT head neg for acute process
   - trend BUN, consider HD if renal function does not improve or if MS
   acutely worsens
   - monitor for infection
   .
   # Renal cell Cancer, metastatic to lung, sternum, L3 vertebrae. s/p
   nephrectomy and failed IL-2, finished 28 day course of sunitinib.
   - follow up with heme/onc recs
   .
   #. DM: hold oral hypoglycemics.  Stable on insulin sliding scale now
   .
   #. HTN:  patient consistently hypertensive, will restart home
   metoprolol but in divided doses
   - metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   .
   #. Back pain / L3 met:   Pt not asking for pain meds
   - Given ARF hold gabapentin.
   - given delirium hold narcotics
   - monitor for leg weakness or incontinence

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who presents with nausea, vomiting, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and lactic acidosis. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple metabolic derangements, including acute tubular necrosis, contrast-induced nephropathy, and sepsis.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has decreased from 9.3 to 7.5, but she still requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further deterioration.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis is likely multifactorial, with contributions from metformin administration, global hypoperfusion, and local production of lactic acid from necrotic tissue in her abdomen.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's lactic acid levels are trending down, but she still requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent further deterioration.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is stable, but she is at risk for bleeding due to her low platelet count and the use of anticoagulant medications.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is not completely oriented, but she is able to remember orientation questions when asked repeatedly. She is at risk for further deterioration in her mental status due to her ARF and potential uremia.
6. Bandemia: The patient's bandemia has resolved, but she is still at risk for infection due to her underlying medical conditions and the presence of necrotic tissue in her abdomen.
7. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP): The patient is at risk for TTP due to her thrombocytopenia and the use of anticoagulant medications.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Further deterioration in the patient's renal function, leading to the need for hemodialysis.
2. Development of sepsis or septic shock due to the presence of necrotic tissue in her abdomen and the use of anticoagulant medications.
3. Bleeding due to the patient's thrombocytopenia and the use of anticoagulant medications.
4. Further deterioration in the patient's mental status due to her ARF and potential uremia.
5. Development of TTP due to the patient's thrombocytopenia and the use of anticoagulant medications.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Renal diet: The patient is on a renal diet to help manage her ARF and prevent further deterioration.
2. Insulin sliding scale: The patient is on an insulin sliding scale to help manage her blood sugar levels.
3. Anticoagulant medications: The patient is on anticoagulant medications to help prevent further deterioration in her renal function and to prevent the development of TTP.
4. Prophylaxis for DVT: The patient is on prophylaxis for DVT due to her immobility and the use of anticoagulant medications.
5. Prophylaxis for stress ulcer: The patient is on prophylaxis for stress ulcer due to her underlying medical conditions and the use of anticoagulant medications.

The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU, where she will continue to receive close monitoring and treatment to manage her underlying medical conditions."
