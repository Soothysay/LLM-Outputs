   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - check cell count, gram stain, cultures from abscess drain; followup
   micro data here and from [**Hospital1 **]
   - empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone at CSF-penetrating doses
   - neurosurgical consult; may culture shunt fluid and will send CSF for
   cell count, cultures
   - general surgery consult for abd abscess
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   - prn morphine for pain
   2. Altered mental status: likely delirium from combination of pain
   medications, infection; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   - NPO for now pending improved mentation
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   3. Hypoxemia; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking history and
   late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely; altered mental
   status likely contributing to hypoventilation
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - prn morphine for splinting
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt, admitted to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 37.2°C (99°F), current temperature 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate 91 bpm, blood pressure 156/90 mmHg, respiratory rate 25 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% on nasal cannula.
* Physical examination: Generalized moaning, difficult to understand, tender abdomen with rebound tenderness.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 10.2 K/uL, Hct 32.1%, Plt 175 K/uL
	+ Blood chemistry: Glucose 100 mg/dL, Cr 0.6 mg/dL, Ca++ 9.4 mg/dL, Mg++ 1.8 mg/dL, PO4 2.0 mg/dL
	+ Coagulation studies: PT 14.2 seconds, PTT 38.2 seconds, INR 1.2
	+ Liver function tests: ALT 39 IU/L, AST 21 IU/L, Alk Phos 41 IU/L, T Bili 0.5 mg/dL
	+ Blood gases: pH 7.31, pCO2 31 mmHg, pO2 105 mmHg

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection
* Respiratory failure due to hypoxemia and hypoventilation
* Cardiovascular instability due to hypotension and electrolyte imbalance
* Neurological deterioration due to brain mets and potential seizures
* Infection-related complications such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or bloodstream infection
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to abdominal abscess
* Renal failure due to decreased perfusion and electrolyte imbalance
* Hepatic failure due to liver dysfunction and potential sepsis

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his condition, including:

* Antibiotic therapy for intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection
* Pain management with morphine and other analgesics
* Respiratory support with oxygen therapy and potential mechanical ventilation
* Cardiovascular support with fluids and vasopressors as needed
* Neurological support with anticonvulsant therapy and close monitoring for seizures
* Gastrointestinal support with prophylactic antibiotics and close monitoring for bleeding or perforation
* Renal support with close monitoring of electrolyte levels and potential hemodialysis
* Hepatic support with close monitoring of liver function tests and potential liver transplantation."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with an unclear primary diagnosis. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and antacids. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 91 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 156/90 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 98%. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an ABG of 31%.

The patient's laboratory results show mild leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 10.2-11.1 K/uL. The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.5 g/dL, and the platelet count is 143-175 K/uL. The patient's renal function is normal, with a creatinine level of 0.5-0.6 mg/dL. The patient's liver function is mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 21-39 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 39-41 IU/L.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's critical condition, with no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, or other systems.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show mild leukocytosis, which may indicate the presence of an infection. The patient's temperature is stable, but the patient's overall condition is critical, making it essential to monitor for signs of sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's ABG result indicates mild respiratory acidosis, which may worsen if the patient's respiratory status is not closely monitored.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is within normal limits, but the patient's overall condition is critical, making it essential to monitor for signs of renal failure.
4. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function is mildly elevated, which may indicate the presence of liver dysfunction or damage.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's platelet count is within normal limits, but the patient's overall condition is critical, making it essential to monitor for signs of coagulopathy.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level is stable, but the patient's overall condition is critical, making it essential to monitor for signs of hypoglycemia.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but the patient's overall condition is critical, making it essential to monitor for signs of electrolyte imbalance.
8. Pressure ulcers: The patient's skin assessment is limited, but the patient's critical condition makes it essential to monitor for signs of pressure ulcers.
9. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient's overall condition is critical, making it essential to monitor for signs of pneumonia.
10. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula, and the patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient's overall condition is critical, making it essential to monitor for signs of VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - check cell count, gram stain, cultures from abscess drain; followup
   micro data here and from [**Hospital1 **]
   - empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone at CSF-penetrating doses
   - neurosurgical consult; may culture shunt fluid and will send CSF for
   cell count, cultures
   - general surgery consult for abd abscess
   - review imaging with radiology here in AM
   - prn morphine for pain
   2. Altered mental status: likely delirium from combination of pain
   medications, infection; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   - NPO for now pending improved mentation
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   3. Hypoxemia; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking history and
   late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely; altered mental
   status likely contributing to hypoventilation
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - prn morphine for splinting
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology in AM; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - check cell count, gram stain, cultures from abscess drain; followup
   micro data here and from [**Hospital1 **]
   - empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone at CSF-penetrating doses
   - neurosurgical consult; may culture shunt fluid and will send CSF for
   cell count, cultures
   - general surgery consult for abd abscess
   - review imaging with radiology here in AM
   - prn morphine for pain
   2. Altered mental status: likely delirium from combination of pain
   medications, infection; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   - NPO for now pending improved mentation
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   3. Hypoxemia; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking history and
   late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely; altered mental
   status likely contributing to hypoventilation
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - prn morphine for splinting
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology in AM; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and known brain mets, was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about an intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. He has been receiving vancomycin and ceftriaxone empirically, and has been prescribed prn morphine for pain. His vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.2°C, Tcurrent of 36.8°C, HR of 91 bpm, BP of 156/90 mmHg, RR of 25 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 98%. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a sinus rhythm.

Physical examination reveals abdominal tenderness and rebound, and the patient is moaning and difficult to understand. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and liver enzymes, with a normal electrolyte panel. Imaging studies have not been reviewed yet.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Abdominal abscess: Empiric antibiotics have been started, and the patient will undergo further evaluation, including cell count, gram stain, and cultures from the abscess drain.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing delirium due to pain medications and infection, and will undergo serial neuro exams and review of brain imaging.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient will continue to receive oxygen therapy and bronchodilators, and will have his mental status monitored for potential contributing factors.
4. Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient will have ongoing goals-of-care discussions with neuro-onc and/or oncology.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to the abdominal abscess and potential VP shunt infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and altered mental status increase his risk of developing respiratory failure.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may worsen if not managed appropriately.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of an abdominal abscess increase his risk of developing further infections.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count may indicate an inflammatory response, which could lead to hemodynamic instability."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old man with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), brain metastases, and a ventriculoperitoneal (V-P) shunt for increased intracranial pressure. He was admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain and concern for abscess.

The patient had undergone ultrasound-guided drainage of a fluid collection in the abdomen yesterday and was transferred to the ICU for concern about V-P shunt infection. However, neurosurgery does not feel that the shunt was infected, and general surgery does not recommend surgery at this time, but rather conservative management with a drain.

The patient's 24-hour events are uneventful, with no significant changes in his condition. He is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and ceftriaxone, and has been started on flagyl. His pain is managed with morphine, and he is receiving incentive spirometry at the bedside.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a tender right side with some rebound tenderness in the abdomen, indicating possible peritonitis. His respiratory examination reveals wheezes on expiration, and his neurologic examination is normal.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.2-11.1 K/uL, with a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL and a platelet count of 175-143 K/uL. His electrolyte levels are normal, with a slight elevation in his lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level.

The patient's imaging studies, including a chest X-ray, show a right upper lobe mass and right hilar fullness, with an elevated right hemidiaphragm.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

* Peritonitis: The patient's abdominal fluid collection was drained, and he is to be followed up with general surgery to obtain culture results. He is to be started on flagyl and have his ceftriaxone dose changed to normal.
* V-P Shunt: Neurosurgery does not feel that the shunt is infected, and it is to be managed conservatively.
* Pain: The patient's pain is to be managed with PRN morphine.
* Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is attributed to his peritoneal process, and he is to continue to receive PRN nebulizers.
* NSCLC: The patient is to be notified to oncology of his presence.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis: The patient's peritonitis and V-P shunt infection could lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and wheezes on expiration could worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
* Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's peritonitis and abdominal tenderness could lead to abdominal compartment syndrome, which can be life-threatening.
* Neurological complications: The patient's brain metastases and V-P shunt could lead to neurological complications, such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure.
* Infection: The patient's V-P shunt and abdominal fluid collection could lead to infection, which could be life-threatening.
* Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy could lead to bleeding, which could be life-threatening.

Based on the patient's condition, it is recommended that he be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration and that his treatment plan be adjusted accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including known asthma and severe emphysema. They were intubated due to acute respiratory distress and have been receiving invasive ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by delirium, hypertension, tachycardia, and wheezing, which may be related to asthma or other underlying conditions. The patient has also developed new Q waves and ST changes on EKG, which may indicate a pulmonary embolism or other cardiac issue.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status has been complicated by wheezing and increased respiratory rate, which may indicate the development of pneumonia.
	* Asthma Attack: The patient's known asthma history and recent wheezing may indicate an asthma attack, which could worsen their respiratory status.
2. Cardiac Complications:
	* Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's new Q waves and ST changes on EKG may indicate a pulmonary embolism, which could lead to cardiac complications.
	* Cardiac Arrest: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may increase their risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Infectious Complications:
	* Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypertension may indicate the development of sepsis, which could worsen their condition.
	* Infections: The patient's recent cultures and antibiotic changes may indicate the development of infections, which could complicate their care.
4. Neurological Complications:
	* Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen their condition and increase their risk of complications.
	* Seizures: The patient's recent changes in mental status and new Q waves on EKG may increase their risk of seizures.
5. Other Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's recent changes in vital signs and recent antibiotic administration may increase their risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
	* Kidney Injury: The patient's recent changes in renal function and recent antibiotic administration may increase their risk of kidney injury.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - check cell count, gram stain, cultures from abscess drain; followup
   micro data here and from [**Hospital1 **]
   - empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone at CSF-penetrating doses
   - neurosurgical consult; may culture shunt fluid and will send CSF for
   cell count, cultures
   - general surgery consult for abd abscess
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   - prn morphine for pain
   2. Altered mental status: likely delirium from combination of pain
   medications, infection; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   - NPO for now pending improved mentation
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   3. Hypoxemia; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking history and
   late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely; altered mental
   status likely contributing to hypoventilation
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - prn morphine for splinting
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, was admitted to the ICU with invasive ventilation, sepsis, and altered mental status. The patient has a history of asthma, smoking, and COPD/emphysema. He was intubated due to worsening respiratory status and concern for pulmonary embolism, which was ruled out by CTPA. The patient's abdomen was cultured, and he was started on empiric antibiotics for intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. He was also given 60 IV Solumedrol for suspected asthma attack.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection: The patient's abdominal drainage culture is pending, and he is receiving empiric antibiotics. However, if the infection is not properly managed, it could lead to sepsis, organ failure, and increased mortality.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and he is requiring invasive ventilation. If the patient's respiratory status does not improve, he may require more aggressive respiratory support, such as ECMO, or even extrusion.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status could be due to delirium, infection, or medication side effects. If left untreated, it could lead to prolonged hospitalization, increased risk of falls, and decreased quality of life.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension could be indicative of underlying cardiovascular disease or medication side effects. If left untreated, it could lead to cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient is at high risk for developing secondary infections due to his immunocompromised state and invasive devices. If left untreated, it could lead to sepsis, organ failure, and increased mortality.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal drainage culture is pending, and he is at risk for developing gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation, if his abdominal abscess is not properly managed.
7. Pulmonary complications: The patient's history of asthma and COPD/emphysema puts him at risk for developing pulmonary complications, such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires continued close monitoring and management of his respiratory, neurological, and cardiovascular status. He should be closely monitored for signs of infection, and his abdominal drainage culture should be closely followed. The patient's pain should be managed with a multimodal approach, and his altered mental status should be closely monitored for signs of delirium or worsening neurological status. The patient's family should be educated on his condition and treatment plan, and they should be involved in his care as much as possible."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will only culture if shunt
   has purulent drainage on inspection.
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Will try Fentanyl patch now while on drip so that when drip is weaned
   off hopefully will have coverage with patch by then
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. If MS ok when gets extubated can have nl diet

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will only culture if shunt
   has purulent drainage on inspection.
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Will try Fentanyl patch now while on drip so that when drip is weaned
   off hopefully will have coverage with patch by then
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. If MS ok when gets extubated can have nl diet

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was admitted to the ICU due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. 

The patient's 24-hour events include the initiation of invasive ventilation, blood and urine cultures, and the administration of antibiotics, sedatives, and pain medications. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with the development of wheezing, hypoxemia, and altered mental status. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and he has a fever, which may indicate the presence of a bacterial infection. 
2. Pulmonary embolism: Although the CTPA was negative, the patient's history of smoking and late age of diagnosis make pulmonary embolism a possible complication. 
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and wheezing may indicate respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by his underlying COPD/emphysema and recent aspiration.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to delirium caused by a combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself.
5. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient's ascites fluid has a WBC count >250, which may indicate the presence of an intra-abdominal abscess.
6. VP shunt infection: The patient's VP shunt is at risk of infection, which may be exacerbated by the presence of bacteria in the ascites fluid.
7. Non-small cell lung cancer progression: The patient's recent bevacizumab treatment may have contributed to the progression of his non-small cell lung cancer.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Abdominal abscess management: The patient will receive antibiotics to cover bowel pathogens, and serial abdominal exams will be performed to monitor for signs of peritonitis.
2. CNS infection management: The patient will receive empiric antibiotics for CNS penetration, and a neurosurgical consult will be obtained to review imaging and plan further management.
3. Altered mental status management: The patient will be closely monitored for signs of delirium, and his pain medications will be adjusted to balance pain relief with the risk of delirium.
4. Respiratory management: The patient will be weaned off the ventilator, and his respiratory status will be closely monitored for signs of respiratory failure.
5. Non-small cell lung cancer management: The patient's oncology team will be consulted to discuss ongoing goals-of-care and treatment options."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here c/w bacterial peritonitis with WBCs >250. On
   Ceftaz as well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams
   - not a good surgical candidate because avastin 2  weeks ago.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will only culture if shunt
   has purulent drainage on inspection.
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   3. Altered mental status: likely delirium from combination of pain
   medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   seems to be clearer with fewer pain meds on board. Now intubated and
   sedated but when extubated may want to just give haldol for agitation
   and stay away from pain meds to see if delirium better without morphine
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today after steroids
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. If MS ok when gets extubated can have nl diet

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient's condition has deteriorated over the past 24 hours, with the following key events:

* Invasive ventilation was started at 12:30 AM.
* Blood and urine cultures were taken, and the patient developed sepsis.
* The patient became delirious and was given morphine, which was later held due to waxing and waning mental status.
* The patient developed tachycardia and hypertension, which was treated with tylenol and haloperidol.
* The patient's oxygen saturation decreased, and he became short of breath, requiring intubation.
* A CT chest scan showed severe emphysema, a new lesion in the left upper lobe, and old lesions in the right upper lobe.
* The patient was given 60 mg of IV solumedrol for a likely COPD exacerbation.
* The patient's abdominal ascites fluid showed bacterial peritonitis, and he was started on ceftazidime and flagyl.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to worsen without proper treatment, and he may develop organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is precarious, and he may require continued mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate underlying cardiovascular instability, which may worsen without proper treatment.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's delirium and altered mental status may indicate underlying neurological complications, such as meningitis or encephalitis.
5. Infection: The patient's VP shunt infection may spread to other areas of the body, leading to serious complications.
6. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD exacerbation may worsen without proper treatment, leading to respiratory failure.
7. Non-small cell lung cancer progression: The patient's non-small cell lung cancer may progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.

In terms of treatment, the patient's care plan should focus on addressing his sepsis, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular instability. He should receive appropriate antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, and cardiovascular support. His delirium and altered mental status should be managed with haloperidol and other medications as needed. His VP shunt infection should be treated with empiric antibiotics, and his COPD exacerbation should be managed with steroids and other medications as needed."

   - not a good surgical candidate because avastin 2  weeks ago.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will only culture if shunt
   has purulent drainage on inspection.
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   3. Altered mental status: likely delirium from combination of pain
   medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   seems to be clearer with fewer pain meds on board. Now intubated and
   sedated but when extubated may want to just give haldol for agitation
   and stay away from pain meds to see if delirium better without morphine
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today after steroids
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today; likely no need for
   formal consult; continue ongoing goals-of-care discussion

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here c/w bacterial peritonitis with WBCs >250. On
   Ceftaz as well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point
   -serial abdominal exams
   - not a good surgical candidate because avastin 2  weeks ago.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will only culture if shunt
   has purulent drainage on inspection.
   - review imaging with radiology here today
   - Gave CD to gen surgery for their review as well
   3. Altered mental status: likely delirium from combination of pain
   medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence of seizures
   - review brain imaging with neuroradiology in AM
   - serial neuro exams
   - treat pain as needed but avoid too many psychoactive medications
   seems to be clearer with fewer pain meds on board. Now intubated and
   sedated but when extubated may want to just give haldol for agitation
   and stay away from pain meds to see if delirium better without morphine
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA

   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read

   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today after steroids
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - touch base with neuro-onc and/or oncology today; likely no need for

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications have arisen:

1. Bacterial peritonitis: The patient's ascites fluid analysis showed WBCs >250, indicating bacterial peritonitis. The patient is being treated with ceftazidime and flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
2. Central nervous system (CNS) infection around shunt: The patient has a VP shunt, and the note suggests the possibility of CNS infection. The patient is being treated empirically with vancomycin and ceftazidime for CNS penetration.
3. Delirium: The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain itself. The patient is being treated with haloperidol (Haldol) to manage agitation.
4. Hypoxemia/wheezing: The patient has a history of asthma, but the note suggests that COPD/emphysema may be a more likely diagnosis given the patient's age and smoking history. The patient is being treated with solumedrol for a likely COPD exacerbation.
5. Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient has a diagnosis of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and has received bevacizumab approximately two weeks ago. The patient's condition is being managed by ongoing goals-of-care discussions with neuro-onc and/or oncology.
6. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although the CTPA was negative for PE, the patient's symptoms and history suggest that PE is a possible complication.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which may indicate respiratory failure.
8. Sepsis: The patient's temperature is 100.4°F (axillary), and the patient has a history of bacterial peritonitis and potential CNS infection, which may indicate sepsis.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and at risk for VAP.
10. Worsening of lung cancer: The patient's condition is being managed by ongoing goals-of-care discussions with neuro-onc and/or oncology, but the patient's condition may worsen over time.

The patient's current medications include:

* Ceftriaxone (changed to ceftazidime)
* Flagyl (500mg Q8H)
* Solumedrol (60mg IV daily)
* Haloperidol (Haldol)
* Midazolam (Versed)
* Fentanyl
* Morphine sulfate
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Tiotropium
* Fluticasone/salmeterol
* Levetiracetam (switched to IV)

The patient's laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 10.2-11.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.3-11.1 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 175-143 x 10^9/L

* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 8.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 1.4 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 1.9 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies include:

* CT chest: showing severe emphysema, LUL spiculated lesion, and scattered new nodules
* CTPA: negative for PE
* CXR: showing no interval change, no pulmonary edema, and no PNA

The patient's vital signs include:

* Temperature: 100.4°F (axillary)
* Heart rate: 111-132 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 129/85-191/105 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17-29 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* PaO2/FiO2: 388"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and intrabdominal abscess. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, wheezing, and hypoxemia. He had an aspiration event after sedation yesterday and is likely experiencing respiratory failure due to underlying COPD. The patient's delirium is being managed with low-dose fentanyl patch for pain. The lung cancer has progressed since the last CT scan.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to underlying COPD and aspiration event. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen due to continued use of sedatives and analgesics. Close monitoring of mental status and adjusting medications as necessary is important.
3. Lung Cancer Progression: The patient's lung cancer has progressed, which may lead to further complications, such as respiratory failure, pleural effusion, or metastases.
4. Sepsis: The patient's intrabdominal abscess and respiratory failure increase the risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status is necessary.
5. VAP: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of respiratory secretions and adjusting ventilation parameters as necessary is important.
6. DVT: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and underlying medical conditions. Close monitoring of extremities and adjusting prophylaxis as necessary is important.
7. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to critical illness and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of gastrointestinal symptoms and adjusting prophylaxis as necessary is important."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer, v-p shunt, and intrabdominal abscess. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and wheezing. The patient had an aspiration event after sedation yesterday, which is likely related to his underlying COPD. He is currently receiving invasive ventilation and has been started on solumedrol for COPD. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, and blood pressure of 129/81 mmHg. His respiratory support includes a non-rebreather mask, ventilator mode CMV/ASSIST, and FiO2 of 50%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is at risk of further deterioration. Prolonged mechanical ventilation can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia, and weaning from the ventilator may be challenging.
2. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be a sign of underlying infection, medication side effects, or metabolic disturbances. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address this condition.
3. Lung cancer progression: The patient's lung cancer has progressed, which may affect his respiratory status and overall prognosis.
4. Infection: The patient has an intrabdominal abscess and is receiving antibiotics. There is a risk of infection spreading to other parts of the body, and close monitoring is necessary.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is unstable, with a net fluid loss of 890 mL over the past 24 hours. This may indicate inadequate fluid resuscitation or excessive fluid loss, which can lead to hypotension and organ dysfunction.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, and his heart rate is above the normal range. This may indicate underlying cardiovascular instability, which requires close monitoring and management.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving nutrition support, but it is unclear if he is receiving adequate calories and protein. Malnutrition can exacerbate underlying medical conditions and impede recovery.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's bleeding parameters are not mentioned in the note, but there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with lung cancer and abdominal abscesses. Close monitoring of bleeding parameters is necessary."

   Provisional Findings Impression: JKPe MON [**2181-8-6**] 11:10 PM
   No findings to suggest intracranial infection or VP shunt infection.
   Interval
   progression of vasogenic edema within the centrum semiovale bilaterally
   worrisome for metastatic disease; however, no enhancing lesions were
   identified. Further evaluation with MRI would be beneficial.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will consider pulling VP
   today
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Pt fully sedated for possible surgery today

   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will consider pulling VP
   today
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Pt fully sedated for possible surgery today
   - serial neuro exams if less sedated
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, is being treated in the ICU for concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 125/79 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98%, and his respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, and a white blood cell count of 10.2 x 10^9/L. The patient's liver enzymes are slightly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase level of 20 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase level of 16 IU/L.

The patient's imaging studies show evidence of global white matter edema on the CT scan of the brain, which may be consistent with radiation therapy. The patient's OSH PET CT scan shows metastases to the liver, adrenal gland, and L4 vertebra, as well as an increase in the size of the lung lesions.

The patient's medical history is significant for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, with known brain mets and VP shunt. The patient's wife is actively involved in his care and is pushing for aggressive measures.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient's ascites fluid is positive for WBCs, and the patient is receiving antibiotics to cover bowel pathogens. The patient's wife has been advised to monitor for signs of peritonitis.
2. CNS infection around shunt: The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics for CNS penetration, and the neurosurgical team is considering pulling the VP shunt today.
3. Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing delirium due to a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain. The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of seizures and will require serial neuro exams.
4. Hypoxemia/wheezing: The patient has a history of asthma, but the patient's wife believes that the patient may have COPD/emphysema. The patient is receiving steroids for a likely COPD exacerbation and will need to be closely monitored for signs of respiratory distress.
5. Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient's cancer is progressing, and the patient's wife is unsure how this will inform management."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will consider pulling VP
   today
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Pt fully sedated for possible surgery today
   - serial neuro exams if less sedated
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient's condition is complicated by the following:

1. Abdominal abscess: The patient has ascites fluid with WBCs >250, which is being treated with antibiotics. The patient is being closely monitored for peritoneal signs, and serial abdominal exams are being performed if possible.
2. CNS infection around shunt: The patient is being treated with empiric antibiotics for CNS penetration. Neurosurgical consult is considering pulling the VP shunt today.
3. Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing delirium due to a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain. He is being sedated for possible surgery today and will have serial neuro exams if less sedated.
4. Hypoxemia/wheezing: The patient has a history of asthma, but it is more likely that he has COPD/emphysema, which is supported by CT scan findings. He is being treated with steroids for a likely COPD exacerbation.
5. Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient received bevacizumab approximately two weeks ago and is progressing. The wife is concerned about the patient's management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to the abdominal abscess and potential infection around the VP shunt.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and wheezing can lead to respiratory failure, especially if he is not able to be weaned off the ventilator.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status can worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to cancer and treatment makes him more susceptible to infections.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension can worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these complications and ensure his optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will consider pulling VP
   today
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Pt fully sedated for possible surgery today
   - serial neuro exams if less sedated
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, is currently in the ICU due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple comorbidities, including COPD, emphysema, and possible asthma. He has a history of bevacizumab treatment for his lung cancer, which may be contributing to his current condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 125/79 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 98% on 50% FiO2. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, indicating possible infection or inflammation. His liver function tests (LFTs) are normal, but his renal function tests (RFTs) show elevated creatinine and urea levels.

The patient's imaging studies show global white matter edema on CT scan, which may be consistent with radiation therapy. The CT scan also shows an increase in size of lung lesions, which is consistent with the patient's known metastatic lung cancer.

Potential medical complications:

1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient's abdominal CT scan shows an increase in size of the previously described spiculated lesion in the right upper lobe, which may be consistent with an abscess.
2. VP shunt infection: The patient's VP shunt is at risk of infection, particularly given the patient's compromised immune system.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is precarious, with hypoxemia and wheezing, which may be exacerbated by his COPD and emphysema.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase levels may indicate sepsis, particularly given the patient's history of infection and compromised immune system.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may be due to delirium, pain, or infection, which may require further evaluation and management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider weaning him off ventilator if possible.
3. Consider further evaluation of the patient's neurological status, including serial neuro exams and imaging studies.
4. Monitor the patient's laboratory results, including white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase levels, to assess for signs of infection or inflammation.
5. Consider further evaluation of the patient's abdominal abscess, including serial abdominal exams and imaging studies."

   No findings to suggest intracranial infection or VP shunt infection.
   Interval
   progression of vasogenic edema within the centrum semiovale bilaterally
   worrisome for metastatic disease; however, no enhancing lesions were
   identified. Further evaluation with MRI would be beneficial.
   CT Chest:
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Negative examination for pulmonary embolism.
   2. Increase in size of the previously described spiculated lesion in
   the
   right upper lobe, now extending to the pleura.
   3. New lung nodules as described above.
   4. Atelectasis of the right lower lobe, associated with effusion; no
   pleural
   nodule.
   5. Bronchomalacia of the right main bronchus and intermedius bronchus,
   evoked by expiration.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will consider pulling VP
   today
 on OR schedule
   - F/U final read
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR
   - Pt fully sedated for possible surgery today
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for
   wife
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and known brain metastases, who was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. The patient's condition is complex, with multiple medical issues, including:

* Global white matter edema on CT scan, possibly related to radiation therapy
* Increase in size of lung lesions and metastases to the liver, adrenal, and L4
* Abdominal abscess and peritonitic signs on exam
* CNS infection around the shunt, with empiric antibiotics
* Altered mental status, likely due to delirium from pain medications, infection, or pain
* Hypoxemia and wheezing, possibly related to asthma, COPD, or aspiration
* Non-small cell lung cancer, with bevacizumab treatment approximately 2 weeks ago

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intra-abdominal sepsis and organ failure due to the abdominal abscess and peritonitis
2. CNS infection and meningitis due to the shunt infection
3. Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying lung disease and hypoxemia
4. Cardiovascular instability due to the patient's hypotension and potential sepsis
5. Neurological deterioration due to the patient's altered mental status and potential seizures
6. Infection and sepsis due to the patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central lines and catheters
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the patient's abdominal disease and medications
8. Pulmonary embolism due to the patient's immobility and underlying lung disease

Plan:

1. Continue empiric antibiotics for the abdominal abscess and CNS infection
2. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider imaging studies to evaluate for progression of the brain metastases
3. Continue to manage the patient's pain and delirium, with a focus on balancing analgesia and sedation
4. Wean the patient off the ventilator if possible, and consider extubation if the patient's respiratory status improves
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and manage any signs of cardiovascular instability
6. Consider further imaging studies, such as MRI, to evaluate for progression of the patient's disease and potential complications

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs. Will consider pulling VP
   today
   - F/U final read
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Pt fully sedated for possible surgery today
   - serial neuro exams if less sedated
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for
   wife

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory: Intubated and ventilated due to hypoxemia and wheezing, with a diagnosis of likely COPD/emphysema. He has severe emphysema on CT scan and wheezing on exam.
* Cardiovascular: Hemodynamically stable, with a blood pressure of 125/79 mmHg and a heart rate of 96 beats per minute.
* Neurological: Altered mental status, likely due to delirium from pain medications, infection, or pain itself. He is fully sedated for possible surgery today.
* Abdominal: Cultures from NGTD are pending, and he is receiving antibiotics for possible intra-abdominal abscess.
* Laboratory results: WBC count is 10.2 x 10^9/L, Hct is 32.1%, and platelet count is 175 x 10^9/L. Other lab results are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient's abdominal abscess is not resolving, and he is still receiving antibiotics. If the abscess does not improve, surgical intervention may be necessary.
2. VP shunt infection: The patient's VP shunt is at risk of infection, and he is receiving empiric antibiotics. If the infection does not improve, surgical intervention may be necessary.
3. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is at risk of developing further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, but he is at risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is altered, and he is at risk of developing further neurological complications, such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to improve his respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 63-year-old with metastatic lung cancer, who has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, intraabdominal abscess, and V-P shunt. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, and blood pressure of 128/80 mmHg. The patient is receiving respiratory support with a ventilator, and their oxygen saturation is 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.1, hemoglobin of 31.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 143,000. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 20 and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 16. The patient's creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL, and their blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 30 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show a negative CT chest scan for pulmonary embolism, with increased size of lesions on the right and new lesions on the left. The patient's V-P shunt is positive, and they are at risk for delirium due to prior brain radiation therapy and CT changes.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a major barrier to extubation, and there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration if the patient is not closely monitored.
2. Intraabdominal abscess: The patient's intraabdominal abscess is a potential source of sepsis and can lead to further complications if not properly managed.
3. V-P shunt: The patient's V-P shunt is a potential source of bleeding and can lead to further complications if not properly managed.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium is a potential complication of their prior brain radiation therapy and CT changes, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not properly managed.
5. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and liver function tests suggest that they may be at risk for sepsis, which can lead to further complications if not properly managed.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN level and creatinine level suggest that they may be at risk for renal failure, which can lead to further complications if not properly managed.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and elevated white blood cell count suggest that they may be at risk for pneumonia, which can lead to further complications if not properly managed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

He has undergone various treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgical interventions. The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, analgesics, and sedatives. He has a drain in place for an intraabdominal abscess, and cultures have come back negative. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, and blood pressure of 128/80 mmHg. He is on a ventilator with a tidal volume of 480 mL and a respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a major concern, and the main barrier to extubation is his altered mental status and delirium. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration if the patient's sedation is minimized or if he experiences an episode of respiratory failure.
2. Intraabdominal abscess: Although the patient's drain is in place, there is a risk of further abscess formation or complications if the patient's immune system is compromised.
3. V-P shunt: The patient's V-P shunt is a potential source of complications, including infection, bleeding, or obstruction.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium is a concern, and there is a risk of further cognitive decline or development of other neurologic complications.
5. Sepsis: The patient's metastatic cancer and immunosuppressive therapy increase his risk of developing sepsis, particularly if he develops an infection.
6. Bleeding: The patient's cancer and therapy increase his risk of bleeding, particularly if he develops a coagulopathy or if his platelet count is low.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and poor oral intake increase his risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein-energy malnutrition.
8. Wound complications: The patient's surgical interventions and immunosuppressive therapy increase his risk of developing wound complications, including infection, dehiscence, or bleeding.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider fentanyl prn for agitation if still delirious
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider fentanyl prn for agitation if still delirious
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, underwent VP shunt removal in the operating room last evening. A post-op head CT scan showed a trace amount of intraventricular hemorrhage in the left occipital region, but no significant interval change. The patient grew GPC in a blood culture, which may be contamination. He is currently intubated and sedated with propofol, and the goal is to extubate him today. The patient has a history of abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection, and is being treated with antibiotics. He also has altered mental status, likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain itself. The patient has a history of asthma, COPD/emphysema, and non-small cell lung cancer, and is receiving treatment for his disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's blood culture grew GPC, which may be a sign of infection. The patient is at risk for developing sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and death.
2. Bleeding: The patient's post-op head CT scan showed a trace amount of intraventricular hemorrhage, which could worsen and lead to bleeding complications.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain itself. This could worsen and lead to increased agitation, confusion, and hallucinations.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to his lung disease and intubation. He is at risk for developing respiratory failure, which could lead to ventilator dependence and death.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension could worsen and lead to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection puts him at risk for developing gastrointestinal complications such as peritonitis, bowel obstruction, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of non-small cell lung cancer and brain metastases puts him at risk for developing neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, and cognitive decline.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy to treat the patient's infection.
2. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and consider transfusing blood products if necessary.
3. Adjust the patient's pain medication regimen to minimize delirium and improve pain control.
4. Continue respiratory support and consider weaning the patient off the ventilator if his respiratory status improves.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider adjusting his medication regimen if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider adjusting his medication regimen if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider adjusting his medication regimen if necessary.
8. Consider consulting a neurosurgeon to evaluate the patient's VP shunt and assess the risk of further bleeding or infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for
   wife
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Started on solumedrol 60mg IV daily for likely COPD exacerbation
   per wife this has happened in the past and steroids helped however as
   likely just acute aspiration will d/c today
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today if not going to surgery
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Unclear how this informs management for
   wife
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Infection: The patient has a VP shunt infection, which is a serious complication. The preliminary head CT scan shows a trace amount of intraventricular hemorrhage, which may indicate a more severe infection.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of abdominal abscess and is being treated with antibiotics for potential bowel pathogens. If the infection spreads, it may lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to delirium caused by a combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself. This can lead to difficulty in managing pain and may increase the risk of falls and other complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe emphysema and is intubated. If the patient is not extubated soon, it may lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient has hypoxemia, which may be due to aspiration, COPD exacerbation, or other respiratory complications. If not managed promptly, it may lead to respiratory failure.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of abdominal abscess and is being treated with antibiotics. If the infection spreads, it may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has a VP shunt infection, which may lead to neurological complications such as meningitis or encephalitis.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has hypertension and may be at risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

To manage these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored and treated promptly if any of these complications arise. The patient's treatment plan should include:

1. Aggressive antibiotic therapy for the VP shunt infection and abdominal abscess.
2. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation.
3. Management of delirium with propofol sedation and serial neuro exams.
4. Weaning off ventilator and extubation as soon as possible.
5. Monitoring of the patient's gastrointestinal status and managing any bleeding promptly.
6. Close monitoring of the patient's neurological status and managing any neurological complications promptly.
7. Cardiovascular monitoring and management of hypertension.
8. Communication with the patient's oncologist to ensure that the patient's cancer treatment is not compromised by the ICU care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider haldol prn for agitation if pain controlled and still
   delirious
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and known brain mets, was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. The patient underwent VP shunt removal, and a post-op head CT showed a trace amount of intraventricular hemorrhage. Blood cultures grew GPC, which may be due to contamination. The patient is currently intubated and receiving sedation with propofol.

Potential medical complications:

1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient's abdominal exam is positive for peritonitis, and cultures from the NG tube are pending. The patient is receiving antibiotics, and serial abdominal exams will be performed.
2. CNS infection around shunt: The patient's VP shunt was removed, and he is receiving empiric antibiotics. Neurosurgical consultation is planned, and cultures of the VP shunt tip will be sent.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain. Delirium is a concern, and the patient is being sedated with propofol to facilitate serial neuro exams.
4. Hypoxemia/wheezing: The patient has a history of asthma and severe emphysema, and his wheezing is likely exacerbated by aspiration when he was sedated overnight.
5. Non-small cell lung cancer: The patient's disease is progressing, and his wife is aware of his condition. The patient's oncologist is aware of his status and will be updated regularly.
6. Infection: The patient's blood cultures grew GPC, which may indicate a bloodstream infection. Further cultures and antibiotic therapy are necessary.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Weaning off the ventilator is planned, but the patient's respiratory status will need to be closely monitored.

Recommendations:

1. Continue empiric antibiotics for the intra-abdominal abscess and CNS infection.
2. Monitor the patient's abdominal exam and serial abdominal exams for signs of worsening infection.
3. Continue sedation with propofol and perform serial neuro exams to assess the patient's mental status.
4. Wean the patient off the ventilator, but closely monitor his respiratory status.
5. Continue antibiotic therapy for the bloodstream infection.
6. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust his insulin regimen as necessary.
7. Consider using a fentanyl patch for pain control and avoid morphine due to its potential to exacerbate delirium."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient underwent VP shunt removal in the OR last evening and was found to have a trace amount of intraventricular hemorrhage on post-op head CT. The patient's blood culture grew GPC in pairs and clusters, which may be due to contamination.

The patient is currently receiving propofol sedation and is restless this morning. The goal is to extubate the patient today. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.6°C, Tcurrent of 36.9°C, HR of 101 bpm, BP of 139/91 mmHg, RR of 26 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 96%.

The patient's lab results show mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL, and mild thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 121 K/uL. The patient's WBC count is within normal limits, and the differential shows a slight increase in neutrophils.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST mode, with a VT of 480 mL, RR of 16, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.44, PaO2 of 248, and PaCO2 of 52.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their sedation and respiratory status. The patient's skin and neurologic exams are not assessed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Increased risk of bleeding due to the trace amount of intraventricular hemorrhage
* Potential for respiratory complications due to the patient's mechanical ventilation and the possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Risk of infection due to the patient's GPC-positive blood culture
* Potential for cardiac complications due to the patient's tachycardia and hypertension
* Risk of gastrointestinal complications due to the patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis and the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Further monitoring and management of the patient's condition will be necessary to address these potential complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who has undergone shunt removal and is currently being treated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
* Heart rate: 101 bpm
* Blood pressure: 139/91 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* SpO2: 96%

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a respiratory support mode of CPAP/PSV and a respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute. The patient's lungs are not wheezing, but the CXR shows a right lower lobe effusion/infiltrate.

The patient's neurological status is also concerning, with the patient opening their eyes to voice but not following commands. The patient's pain is being managed with fentanyl and IV dilaudid.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: 129 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 112 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
* LDH: 173 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.0 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show a small residual amount of blood on head CT and a right lower lobe effusion/infiltrate on CXR.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and the CXR shows an effusion/infiltrate, which can worsen respiratory function.
* Sepsis: The patient has fevers and has been cultured for blood, which can indicate sepsis.
* Delirium: The patient's neurological status is concerning, and the patient is agitated, which can worsen delirium.
* Pain: The patient's pain is not well-controlled, which can worsen respiratory and neurological function.
* Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
* Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which can indicate infection.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend the following:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust respiratory support as needed.
* Administer antibiotics as indicated for sepsis.
* Continue to manage the patient's pain and delirium with appropriate medications.
* Monitor the patient's platelet count and bleeding risk.
* Consider imaging studies to rule out other causes of the patient's symptoms.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust treatment as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who had a shunt removed yesterday and continues to experience fevers. They are currently on CPAP and have a history of COPD, delirium, and respiratory failure. The patient is receiving various medications, including propofol, fentanyl, and dilaudid, and has been administered antibiotics. They have undergone imaging studies, including a head CT and CXR, which revealed a small residual amount of blood and RLL effusion/infiltrate, respectively.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers and blood cultures may indicate the presence of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is exacerbated by COPD and delirium, making extubation challenging. Prolonged mechanical ventilation can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and lung injury.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely to be a barrier to extubation and may require continued sedation and monitoring. Delirium can lead to increased risk of falls, injuries, and prolonged hospitalization.
4. Pain Management: The patient's pain is managed with fentanyl and dilaudid, but inadequate pain control can lead to agitation, delirium, and respiratory compromise.
5. Infection: The patient's RLL effusion/infiltrate on CXR may indicate the presence of an infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and cause sepsis.
6. Bloodstream Infection: The patient's blood cultures may indicate the presence of a bloodstream infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and failure.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged bleeding time and low platelet count may indicate the presence of a coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, may indicate the presence of an electrolyte imbalance, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their various medical conditions to prevent potential complications and improve their clinical outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider fentanyl prn for agitation if still delirious
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider fentanyl prn for agitation if still delirious
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Attempt to wean off ventilator today
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of intra-abdominal abscess, VP shunt infection, and altered mental status. He was intubated and received invasive ventilation, which was stopped and restarted multiple times due to respiratory distress. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypoxemia, wheezing, and possible aspiration. He has received various medications, including antibiotics, pain medications, and bronchodilators. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatinine levels. His chest CT scan showed severe emphysema and wheezing.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient's abdominal abscess is a high-risk condition that requires prompt treatment. If left untreated, it can lead to sepsis, organ failure, and mortality.
2. VP shunt infection: The patient's VP shunt infection is a serious complication that requires immediate attention. If left untreated, it can lead to meningitis, brain abscess, and death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia put him at risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxemic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and mortality.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase levels suggest possible sepsis, which can lead to organ failure, shock, and mortality if left untreated.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and possible seizures put him at risk of neurological complications, such as brain edema, cerebral vasospasm, and brain death.
6. Infection-related complications: The patient's various infections, including pneumonia, sepsis, and VP shunt infection, increase his risk of developing infection-related complications, such as septic shock, organ failure, and mortality.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal abscess and possible aspiration put him at risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and obstruction.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia put him at risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and mortality."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, who was previously intubated and mechanically ventilated, was extubated and placed on a shovel mask. However, they experienced increased work of breathing, tachycardia, and hypoxia, requiring nebulization and oxygen therapy. The patient's respiratory status remained unstable, with a respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 94%. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 118 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 162/98 mmHg. The patient's laboratory results showed mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and they may be at risk of developing respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR shows increased opacification in the right lung, which may indicate pneumonia.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient was previously mechanically ventilated, and the risk of VAP is high.
4. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels, which may indicate sepsis.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and liver dysfunction may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's electrolyte imbalances and increased lactate levels may indicate renal failure.
8. Sepsis-Induced Multi-Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (SMODS): The patient's sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction may increase the risk of SMODS.

Recommendations:

1. Continue oxygen therapy and nebulization as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider reintubation if necessary.
3. Administer antibiotics as prescribed and monitor for signs of sepsis.
4. Manage the patient's coagulopathy and liver dysfunction with appropriate medications and fluids.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte imbalances and renal function closely.
6. Consider consulting a cardiologist for further management of the patient's cardiac status.
7. Consider consulting a gastroenterologist for further management of the patient's gastrointestinal status."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required CPAP
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider fentanyl prn for agitation if still delirious
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   4. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - cont tiotropium and fluticasone/salmeterol with prn nebulizers when
   he is extubated
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required CPAP
   1. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   -serial abdominal exams if able given sedation.
   -watch WBCs and BPS. If hypotensive may be septic and would need
   re-scan of abdomen.
   2. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt last
   evening. Neruosgy will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - F/U final read of post op head CT
   - F/up cultures of VP shunt tip
   -Blood cultures from OSH NGTD
   3. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Propofol instead for sedation so that can turn off and have serial
   neuron exams once done in OR.  With goal of extubation
   - serial neuro exams
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 4787**].
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - [**Month (only) 60**] consider fentanyl prn for agitation if still delirious
   4. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient's 24-hour events include:

* Invasive ventilation was stopped and started multiple times, with a total duration of approximately 1 hour.
* He was extubated and placed on a shovel mask, but developed shortness of breath (SOB) and was given nebs (albuterol and atrovent).
* He was tachycardic (110s) and had increased work of breathing, requiring the addition of CPAP, which seemed to calm him down.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
* Heart rate: 118 bpm
* Blood pressure: 162/98 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* SpO2: 94%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Dyspnea and flushing
* Head wounds and surgical dressing, with no signs of edema, hematoma, or infection
* Tachycardia and poor airflow with prolonged expiration and wheezing on the right and left sides
* Tender and nondistended abdomen
* Clubbing, but no edema, in the limbs

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 118 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 89 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
* LDH: 173 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.6 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with brain mets
* VP shunt infection
* Intra-abdominal abscess
* Asthma/COPD/emphysema
* Neurosurgical/surgical evaluation

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing antibiotics for VP shunt infection and intra-abdominal abscess
* Serial abdominal exams and WBC counts
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis
* Neurosurgical consultation for VP shunt infection
* Consideration of fentanyl patch for pain control
* Avoidance of morphine due to exacerbation of delirium

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to asthma/COPD/emphysema
* Sepsis from intra-abdominal abscess or VP shunt infection
* Delirium from pain medications or infection
* Increased risk of bleeding due to platelet count
* Increased risk of kidney damage due to high blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels
* Increased risk of electrolyte imbalances due to high blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels
* Increased risk of respiratory failure due to poor airflow and wheezing on the right and left sides."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   #. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required BiPAP
   - Start 60mg solumedrol q8
   - Give lasix to pull off 1L fluids
   #. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   - All cultures here and at OSH are negative after a week
   #. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - All Cx here and at OSH negative
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with pain control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was admitted to the ICU for suspected intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. He was intubated due to respiratory distress and required BiPAP support. He was also experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. His medical history includes asthma, COPD, and emphysema.

Progress:

The patient's condition has been stable on BiPAP support, but he continues to experience respiratory distress and wheezing. His oxygen saturation has been around 94%. He has been receiving antibiotics for suspected intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. His abdominal pain has been managed with pain medications, and he has been NPO due to suspected aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and wheezing may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Intra-abdominal abscess: The patient's abdominal pain and nausea may indicate an ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
3. VP shunt infection: The patient's VP shunt may be infected, which could lead to meningitis and brain abscess.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to delirium and confusion.
5. Pain management: The patient's pain may not be adequately managed, leading to discomfort and distress.
6. Infection: The patient may develop a secondary infection, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection, due to his compromised immune system.
7. Organ failure: The patient's underlying medical conditions, such as COPD and emphysema, may lead to organ failure, such as respiratory or cardiac failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue BiPAP support and monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
2. Manage the patient's abdominal pain and nausea with pain medications and antacids.
3. Monitor the patient's VP shunt and abdominal drain closely for signs of infection.
4. Manage the patient's delirium with antipsychotics and sedatives as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's pain and adjust pain medications as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's infection status and adjust antibiotics as needed.
7. Consider weaning the patient from BiPAP support once his respiratory status improves."

   Will start solumedrol
   to treat COPD.  Will also try some diuretics.
   Abdominal abscess:  Cultures all negative (although drawn after onset

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with respiratory failure, abdominal abscess, and lung cancer. They were extubated yesterday but experienced tachycardia and shortness of breath, which improved with the use of albuterol and atrovent. The patient was re-intubated and placed on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIV) with improved oxygenation. They have a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and are receiving antibiotics for the abdominal abscess.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 149/92 mmHg. Their respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The patient is receiving fluids, antibiotics, and pain medication.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Their creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are within normal limits. The patient's CXR shows an increasing right lower lobe infiltrate or effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if they do not respond to NIV and oxygen therapy.
2. Abdominal abscess: The patient's abdominal abscess may continue to cause sepsis and organ dysfunction if not adequately treated with antibiotics and surgical drainage.
3. Lung cancer: The patient's lung cancer may progress and cause further respiratory compromise if not treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
4. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen if they do not respond to antibiotics and fluid resuscitation.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged ICU stay may lead to nutritional deficiencies, such as malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's prolonged ICU stay may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation, diarrhea, and bleeding.
8. Infection: The patient's prolonged ICU stay may lead to infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient was extubated yesterday but experienced tachycardia and shortness of breath, requiring reintubation. The patient is currently receiving non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with a pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode and has improved oxygenation.

The patient has a history of COPD, which is being treated with solumedrol and diuretics. The patient also has an abdominal abscess, which is being treated with antibiotics, and cultures are pending. The patient has a lung cancer diagnosis and is receiving ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 149/92 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is improving, with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.3, hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 115,000/uL.

The patient's medical complications and potential risks include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but they are still at risk for respiratory failure due to their underlying COPD and lung cancer.
2. Abdominal abscess: The patient's abdominal abscess is being treated with antibiotics, but there is a risk of complications such as sepsis, perforation, or peritonitis.
3. Lung cancer: The patient's lung cancer is a significant risk factor for respiratory failure, and the patient may require further treatment or management.
4. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to their immobility and underlying medical conditions.
5. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to their respiratory therapy and the presence of a tracheostomy tube.
6. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to their abdominal abscess and underlying medical conditions.
7. Fluid overload: The patient is at risk for fluid overload due to their underlying medical conditions and the use of diuretics.

The patient's care plan includes:

1. Respiratory therapy: The patient will continue to receive NIV with a PSV mode and oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Antibiotics: The patient will continue to receive antibiotics for their abdominal abscess.
3. Diuretics: The patient will receive diuretics to manage fluid overload and respiratory failure.
4. Pain management: The patient will receive pain management with morphine and fentanyl as needed.
5. Prophylaxis: The patient will receive prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.
6. Monitoring: The patient will be closely monitored for signs of respiratory failure, abdominal abscess complications, lung cancer progression, DVT, VAP, sepsis, and fluid overload."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   #. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath;
   - No PE on CTPA
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required BiPAP but now stable on
   shovel mask
   - 60mg solumedrol q8
   - lasix to pull off 1L fluids but only -300mL yesterday. [**Month (only) 60**] want to
   give more fluids.
   #. Abdominal abscess; no peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   #. CNS infection around shunt with GPCs and GNRs on culture of tip of
   VP shunt
   -vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help with pain
   control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, was admitted to the ICU with concerns for intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. He was previously intubated but was weaned off respiratory support and is now stable on a shovel mask. The patient has a history of asthma, but the diagnosis is likely COPD/emphysema due to his smoking history and late age of diagnosis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 141/85 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 25 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 95%. He has a central venous catheter and is receiving antibiotics for suspected intra-abdominal abscess and CNS infection around the VP shunt.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.1-9.7 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 10.3-12.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 118-122 K/μL
* Creatinine: 0.4-0.4 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 34-36 mmHg
* Glucose: 83-140 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is notable for the following:

* Peripheral vascular examination: Not assessed
* Skin examination: Not assessed
* Neurologic examination: Responds to stimuli, but movement, tone, and cognitive status are not assessed

The patient's diagnosis and treatment plan include:

* Hypoxemia/wheezing: Asthma/COPD diagnosis, treated with BiPAP and lasix
* Abdominal abscess: Cultures pending, treated with Ceftaz and Flagyl
* CNS infection around VP shunt: Treated with vancomycin and ceftaz
* Altered mental status: Likely delirium, treated with fentanyl patch and levetiracetam
* Non-small cell lung cancer: Received bevacizumab 2 weeks ago, progressing disease

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: Given the patient's history of COPD/emphysema and wheezing, there is a risk of respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient has suspected intra-abdominal abscess and CNS infection, which can lead to sepsis.
* Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, and it is essential to balance pain medications and delirium.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk of developing a pulmonary embolism due to his immobility and history of smoking.
* Kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels are slightly elevated, and there is a risk of kidney injury due to his underlying disease and treatment.

Based on the patient's condition and treatment plan, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   #. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath; Now intubated s/p CTA
   of chest. All of the above could also be explained by aspiration when
   patient was sedated overnight which put greater stress on his already
   compromised lungs allowing him to become more obstructed.
   - No PE on CTPA but need to follow up final read
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required BiPAP
   - Start 60mg solumedrol q8
   - Give lasix to pull off 1L fluids
   #. Abdominal abscess; peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   - All cultures here and at OSH are negative after a week
   #. CNS infection around shunt
   -empiric vanco and ceftaz for CNS penetration
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   - All Cx here and at OSH negative
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to IV)
   -Will place fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help
   with pain control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 141/85 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 95% on a face tent with 50% FiO2. His respiratory rate is 25 breaths per minute, and his ABG results show a pH of 7.38, pCO2 of 55 mmHg, and pO2 of 95 mmHg.

The patient has been diagnosed with asthma, but it is likely that he has COPD/emphysema due to his smoking history and late age of diagnosis. He also has a history of VP shunt infection and intra-abdominal abscess.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His liver enzymes are slightly elevated, and his albumin level is low. His electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics for suspected intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. He is also receiving steroids for his asthma and pain management for his cancer.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD/emphysema may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection may progress, leading to sepsis.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's brain mets may worsen, leading to neurological complications such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to delirium.
5. Pain management issues: The patient's pain may not be adequately managed, leading to increased distress and discomfort.
6. Infection: The patient's wounds may become infected, leading to further complications.
7. Organ dysfunction: The patient's liver and kidney function may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure may worsen, leading to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   #. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath;
   - No PE on CTPA
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required BiPAP but now stable on
   shovel mask
   - 60mg solumedrol q8 for 3 days then 30mg Q8 for 2 days then off.
   - lasix to pull off 1L fluids but only -300mL yesterday. Repeat today
   to pull off more fluid as lungs still a bit wet.
   #. Abdominal abscess; no peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens. Will continue until culture
   results from VP shunt tip speciated as may need anaerobic coverage for
   that.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sgy
   #. CNS infection around shunt with GPCs and GNRs on culture of tip of
   VP shunt
   -vanco, flagyl and ceftaz
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to PO)
   -Fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help with pain
   control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
 dilaudid prn
   if needed for pain although now no pain
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about an intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. He has a history of smoking and late-age diagnosis, making COPD/emphysema more likely. The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress, but was weaned off respiratory support and is now stable on a shovel mask. He has an abdominal abscess, which is being treated with antibiotics, and a CNS infection around the VP shunt, which is being treated with antibiotics and neurosurgical consultation. The patient has altered mental status, likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain itself, and is being managed with pain control measures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD/emphysema and acute respiratory distress puts him at risk for respiratory failure, especially if he develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
2. Intra-abdominal sepsis: The patient's abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection put him at risk for intra-abdominal sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and death.
3. Central nervous system (CNS) infection: The patient's CNS infection around the VP shunt could lead to meningitis, encephalitis, or other CNS complications, which could result in long-term neurological deficits or death.
4. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and use of pain medications and antibiotics put him at risk for delirium, which could lead to confusion, agitation, and increased risk of falls and other complications.
5. Pain management: The patient's use of pain medications and the risk of delirium due to these medications puts him at risk for inadequate pain management, which could lead to increased pain and suffering.
6. Infection: The patient's use of antibiotics and the risk of infection due to his medical conditions and treatments puts him at risk for developing new infections, which could lead to organ failure and death.
7. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and the risk of bleeding due to his medical conditions and treatments puts him at risk for bleeding complications, which could lead to organ failure and death.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of smoking and COPD/emphysema puts him at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications due to his underlying medical conditions, treatments, and age. Close monitoring and management of his condition are essential to prevent or minimize these complications and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, and they have been taken off bipap. However, they still require oxygen therapy with a face tent, and their vital signs indicate ongoing respiratory distress. The patient's heart rhythm is normal, and their blood pressure is stable.

The patient's abdominal abscess has improved, and their abdominal exam is now soft and non-tender. However, they still require antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftazidime, and metronidazole, to treat the polymicrobial growth in the V-P shunt.

The patient's laboratory results indicate ongoing inflammatory responses, with elevated white blood cell counts, lactate levels, and liver enzymes. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but their albumin level is low.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory distress and requirement for oxygen therapy increase their risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's polymicrobial growth in the V-P shunt and abdominal abscess increases their risk of developing sepsis.
3. Infection: The patient's ongoing antibiotic therapy and presence of a V-P shunt increase their risk of developing a secondary infection.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's underlying cardiovascular disease and ongoing inflammatory responses increase their risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal abscess and ongoing antibiotic therapy increase their risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea or abdominal pain.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's critical illness and ongoing inflammatory responses increase their risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein-energy malnutrition.

In conclusion, the patient's critically ill condition requires ongoing close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   #. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath;
   - No PE on CTPA
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required BiPAP but now stable on
   shovel mask
   - 60mg solumedrol q8 for 3 days then 30mg Q8 for 2 days then off.
   - lasix to pull off 1L fluids but only -300mL yesterday. Repeat today
   to pull off more fluid as lungs still a bit wet.
   #. Abdominal abscess; no peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens. Will continue until culture
   results from VP shunt tip speciated as may need anaerobic coverage for
   that.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sg
   #. CNS infection around shunt with GPCs and GNRs on culture of tip of
   VP shunt
   -vanco, flagyl and ceftaz
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to PO)
   -Fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help with pain
   control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
 dilaudid prn
   if needed for pain although now no pain
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up
   to date.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, has been admitted to the ICU with concerns of intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. He has a history of asthma, but the diagnosis is likely COPD/emphysema given his smoking history and late age of diagnosis. He was intubated due to respiratory distress and is currently on CPAP/PSV with a FiO2 of 50%. His labs show an elevated WBC count, with cultures from the VP shunt tip showing lactobacillus and coag-neg staph. He has been started on antibiotics, including vancomycin, flagyl, and ceftazidime.

The patient has also been diagnosed with CNS infection around the shunt, with GPCs and GNRs on culture. The VP shunt was pulled, and neurosurgical consult has been obtained. He is currently on a fentanyl patch for pain control and is being closely monitored for delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing further infections, particularly in the abdominal cavity and CNS, due to the presence of a VP shunt and the diagnosis of abscess and CNS infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and he may require continued respiratory support. Pneumonia or further respiratory failure could exacerbate his condition.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may worsen due to the combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself. Delirium could lead to further complications, such as falls, respiratory failure, or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Pain management: The patient's pain is likely to be significant, and inadequate pain management could lead to further complications, such as delirium, respiratory failure, or cardiovascular instability.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's condition could worsen due to the presence of sepsis, respiratory failure, or other underlying medical conditions, leading to cardiovascular instability.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's CNS infection and altered mental status may worsen, leading to further neurological complications, such as seizures, brain edema, or meningitis.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal abscess and altered mental status may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or ileus.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4663**] is a 63 year old man with metastatic non-small cell lung
   cancer with known brain mets and VP shunt, now transferred for
   neurosurgical/surgical evaluation given the concern for intra-abdominal
   abscess and VP shunt infection.
   #. Hypoxemia/wheezing; carries diagnosis of
asthma
 though smoking
   history and late age of diagnosis makes COPD/emphysema more likely
   c/w findings on CT scan which showed severe emphysema and wheezing on
   exam when patient became acutely short of breath;  Now resolving in
   steroid taper and only requiring NC for O2.
   - No PE on CTPA
   - Weaned off respiratory on [**2181-8-8**]. Required BiPAP but now stable on
   shovel mask/NC
   - 60mg solumedrol q8 for 3 days then 30mg Q8 for 2 days then off. (Will
   change to equivalent dosing of PO prednisone).
   #. Abdominal abscess; no peritonitic signs on exam.
   -Cultures from [**Hospital1 **] NGTD
   - Ascites fluid here with WBCs >250. Gram stain negative. On Ceftaz as
   well as flagyl to cover bowel pathogens. Will continue until culture
   results from VP shunt tip speciated as may need anaerobic coverage for
   that.
   - Gen sgy does not feel has acute abdomen or reason to operate at this
   point. If develops peritoneal signs ->rescan and call sg
   #. CNS infection around shunt with GPCs and GNRs on culture of tip of
   VP shunt
   -vanco, flagyl and ceftaz
   - neurosurgical consult: no meningeal signs.  Pulled VP shunt. Neruosgy
   will follow up with serial exams and culture data.
   - Continue abx
   #. Altered mental status before he was intubated: likely delirium from
   combination of pain medications, infection, or pain itself; no evidence
   of seizures. Will be difficult to balance pain meds and delirium
   because patient most likely is in pain but may be delirious from the
   meds.
   - Now more or less at baseline
   - cont home levetiracetam (switch to PO)
   -Fentanyl patch for pain control in hope that it will help with pain
   control and MS
   - Will avoid morphine as seemed to exacerbate delirium
 dilaudid prn
   if needed for pain although now no pain
   - Will avoid BZs since these also seem to aggravate his MS changes
   #. Non-small cell lung cancer: received bevacizumab approx 2 weeks ago
   - Pt seems to be progressing. Wife is aware of progression of disease
   but believes he will receive treatment for it and wants to get him back
   to his pre-admission status.
   - Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4752**] is O/P oncologist. Aware of patient
s status. Will keep up

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old man with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, known brain mets, and a VP shunt. He was transferred to the ICU for neurosurgical/surgical evaluation due to concerns about intra-abdominal abscess and VP shunt infection. The patient has been diagnosed with asthma/COPD/emphysema and is being treated with steroids and oxygen therapy. He also has an abdominal abscess, which is being treated with antibiotics, and a CNS infection around the shunt, which is being treated with antibiotics and neurosurgical consultation. The patient's mental status has been altered, likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain itself, and he is being treated with pain medication and anticonvulsants. The patient's cancer is progressing, and his wife is aware of the progression but wants to get him back to his pre-admission status.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of asthma/COPD/emphysema and his current treatment with oxygen therapy and steroids put him at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has a VP shunt infection and an abdominal abscess, which are being treated with antibiotics. He is also at risk for developing other infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of pain medications, infection, and pain itself, and he is at risk for developing delirium.
4. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and is being treated with anticonvulsants. He is at risk for developing seizures, especially if his medication regimen is not properly managed.
5. Pain: The patient is likely in pain due to his cancer and other medical conditions, and he is at risk for developing chronic pain if his pain is not properly managed.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's altered mental status and decreased mobility put him at risk for malnutrition.
7. Depression: The patient's diagnosis of cancer and his current medical condition put him at risk for developing depression.
8. Anxiety: The patient's diagnosis of cancer and his current medical condition put him at risk for developing anxiety.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's infections with antibiotics and monitor for signs of infection.
3. Continue to manage the patient's pain with medication and other interventions, such as physical therapy and occupational therapy.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and provide support and counseling as needed.
5. Continue to provide nutrition support, such as enteral nutrition or parenteral nutrition, as needed.
6. Consider referring the patient to a palliative care specialist to help manage his symptoms and improve his quality of life.
7. Consider referring the patient to a mental health specialist to help manage his depression and anxiety."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains critical in the ICU. The patient has been diagnosed with lactobacillus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus sepsis, which is being treated with antibiotics. The patient has also developed a VP shunt infection, which is being treated with Solumedrol.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.3°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 141/79 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a peak inspiratory pressure (PS) of 8 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and lactate levels, indicating ongoing sepsis. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL. The patient's coagulation profile is also abnormal, with a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and international normalized ratio (INR).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, or respiratory failure.
2. VP shunt infection leading to meningitis or cerebral edema.
