   # Respiratory failure: Patient has metastatic renal cell carcinoma and
   recent imaging shows worsening of disease. CT-neck performed yesterday
   showed progression of disease, but no tracheal deviation or signs of
   compression.  Yesterday the patient p/w resp distress, inspiratory
   stridor and neck swelling likely due to extrinsic compression from
   bulky LAD and IJ clots. Patient continues to be intubated and sedated.
   Most recent ABG: pH 7.41 pCO2 44 pO2 147 HCO3 29. Afebrile with no
   evidence of pna.  ENT consulted and rec 10mg decadron x3 and monitor
   for cuff leakage.  Also, suggested evaluation by IP/Thoracics for
   possible tracheostomy to bypass compression.  However, family meeting

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to the lungs and brain, who has been admitted to the ICU due to increased neck swelling, worsening neck lymphadenopathy (LAD), and respiratory failure. He has a history of previous chemotherapy and cyberknife treatment for his brain metastases. The patient has been intubated and sedated, and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, a heart rate of 88 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 112/72 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 96% on 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). He has a normal sinus rhythm and a normal chest x-ray.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 3.9 x 10^9/L, a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, and a platelet count of 446 x 10^9/L. His electrolyte levels are normal, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.2 mmol/L.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hypothyroidism, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He has been taking levothyroxine and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) at home.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the progression of his metastatic RCC, which is causing extrinsic compression of his trachea. This may lead to further respiratory compromise and the need for more aggressive management, such as tracheostomy.
2. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient has a history of VTE, including a recent episode of subclavian vein thrombosis. He is at risk for further VTEs, particularly in the setting of his metastatic cancer and recent surgery.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is borderline hypotensive, and he is at risk for further hypertension complications, such as cardiac failure and cerebral edema.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen in the setting of his cancer and treatment, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance.
5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): The patient's GERD may worsen in the setting of his cancer and treatment, leading to symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation, and dysphagia.
6. Feeding tube placement: The patient's decision to place a feeding tube may lead to complications such as aspiration pneumonia, tube displacement, and nutritional deficiencies.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's assessment and plan should focus on addressing his respiratory failure, VTE risk, hypertension, hypothyroidism, GERD, and feeding tube placement. He should continue to receive mechanical ventilation and sedation, and his respiratory status should be closely monitored. He should also receive prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to reduce his risk of VTE. His blood pressure should be closely monitored, and he should receive treatment for his hypertension if necessary. His hypothyroidism should be managed with levothyroxine, and his GERD should be managed with PPIs. His decision to place a feeding tube should be carefully considered, and he should receive close monitoring and treatment for any complications that arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to the lungs and brain. He was recently admitted for increased neck swelling with worsening neck lymphadenopathy (LAD) and neck mass, leading to stridor and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and sedated. Imaging studies showed progression of disease, but no tracheal deviation or signs of compression. The patient has a history of venous clots, including IJ/subclavian/brachiocephalic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and is on lovenox therapy. He also has a history of RCC, brain metastases, and has undergone resection and cyberknife therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk for further deterioration due to his metastatic disease and potential extrinsic compression of the trachea.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a central line and is at risk for central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of venous clots and is at risk for further clotting complications, including DVT and PE.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is borderline hypotensive, and he may require further management to prevent hypotension.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and requires ongoing management with levothyroxine.
6. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): The patient has a history of GERD and requires ongoing management with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).
7. Feeding tube placement: The patient is at risk for aspiration pneumonia due to his respiratory failure and may require placement of a feeding tube.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his immunosuppressed state and respiratory failure.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and is at risk for cardiovascular complications, including heart failure and arrhythmias.
10. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of brain metastases and is at risk for further neurological complications, including seizures and cerebral edema."

   # Respiratory failure: Patient has metastatic renal cell carcinoma and
   recent imaging shows worsening of disease. CT-neck performed yesterday
   showed progression of disease, but no tracheal deviation or signs of
   compression.  Yesterday the patient p/w resp distress, inspiratory
   stridor and neck swelling likely due to extrinsic compression from
   bulky LAD and IJ clots. Patient continues to be intubated and sedated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who has recently been admitted to the ICU for increased neck swelling and worsening respiratory failure. The patient has a history of RCC with metastases to the lungs and brain, and has undergone resection and cyberknife treatment. He is currently intubated and sedated due to respiratory distress and stridor.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* Heart rate: 88 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 112/72 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 96%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 3.9 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 426 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Glucose: 136 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.4 mmol/L
* LDH: 309 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.9 mg/dL

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the metastatic RCC and the compression of his airway by the bulky lymphadenopathy and internal jugular vein clots.
2. IJ/subclavian/brachiocephalic DVT: The patient has a history of venous clots on previous admission, and is at high risk for further thrombosis despite receiving lovenox therapy.
3. Hypertension: The patient is borderline hypotensive after sedation and received IV fluids.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient is taking levothyroxine at home dosage.
5. GERD: The patient is taking PPI medication per home regimen.
6. FEN: The patient is NPO and has an OG tube, IV fluids, and electrolyte supplementation.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Respiratory management: The patient will continue to be intubated and sedated to manage his respiratory distress.
2. DVT prophylaxis: The patient will continue to receive lovenox therapy to prevent further thrombosis.
3. Hypertension management: The patient's blood pressure medications will be held for now and restarted when stable.
4. Thyroid management: The patient's levothyroxine dosage will be continued at home.
5. GERD management: The patient's PPI medication will be continued per home regimen.
6. FEN management: The patient will continue to be NPO and receive IV fluids and electrolyte supplementation.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and the plan is to discuss with the family how to best remove care. The patient's family will be involved in the decision-making process, and the patient's wishes will be respected."
