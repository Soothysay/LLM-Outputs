   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  53 y/o F with PMH of CNS lyme who presents from
   OSH with leukocytosis, abdominal pain, hypotension and concern for
   acute abdomen.
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Differential is broad including gastritis, PUD,
   perforated ulcer, pancreatitis, colitis.  Abdominal pain is fairly
   diffuse, however her abdomen is soft.  There was concern for free air
   at OSH, unfortunately we do not have the data here to confirm this. At
   OSH the patient's abdomen was reportedly rigid and there was concern
   for an acute process which prompted urgent transfer for possible
   surgery.  At this point she is hemodynamically stable and her exam is
   not concerning for peritoneal signs.  Surgery is following closely.
   Patient has been on high-dose steroids so an ulcer is possible, however
   was on GI ppx at OSH with Pepsid.  KUB was also concerning for possible
   obstruction.  Labs here show LFTs and pancreatic enzymes wnl making
   pancreatitis less likely.  C. diff is of concern given recent long
   antibiotics course and leukocytosis, however was neg. x 1 at OSH.
   - Surgery wants GI to scope to provide evidence for/against
   intraluminal cause
 PUD, etc., such that if positive will proceed w/
   surgery, if negative will proceed with angiography for RP bleed
   - GI: scoping this AM
   - will discuss final management plan in coordination w/ GI and Surgery
   - continue serial abd exams
   - continue PPI gtt
   - Cipro/flagyl and Vanco ppx, day#2
   - obtain OSH records
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes sepsis, bleeding, volume
   depletion, toxic shock.  Given leukocytosis an infection is high on the
   differential.  No no longer hypotensive after fluid resuscitaiton
   - Cont. IVF boluses to maintain MAP>60 and UOP>30
   - Consider pressors if unable to maintain with IVF
   - Hct q6
   - CIS
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Improving.  Peaked at OSH this morning at 20.8.
   Currently 13, however this is after abx since this am.  Sources include
   abdomen, line-infection, urine, lungs.  Cultures at OSH reportedly
   negative, however UA there showed 1+ bacteria and [**4-16**] WBC.  Given
   recent antibiotics, diarrhea and abdominal pain, c. diff is of
   concern.  Was neg. x1 at OSH.  CT at OSH also concerning for PNA,
   however patient does not have cough and lungs are clear.  Has low grade
   fever here.
   - f/u OSH culture data
   - f/u CT read here for possible abdominal source
   - CIS
   - Cont. vanc/cipro/flagyl per surgery recommendation
   - Add on differential
   .
   # PE: CTA confirmed PE at OSH, was on Arixtra, last dose this morning.
   Unclear what precipitated this exept for risk factor of being
   hospitalized.  No h/o malignancy, has been getting routine mom[**Name (NI) 5369**]
   and Paps, has not had colonoscopy.  No personal or fam hx. of clot, not
   on HRT.
   - Holding anticoagulation for now in setting of possible procedure
   - Attempt to obtain OSH CT films to confirm PE
   .
   #. CNS Lyme: Received 4 weeks of ceftriaxone for this per her
   Neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5370**].  Per notes from ID consult at OSH, the diagnosis
   of this is in question based on her CSF results. Reports a history of
   neuropathy in her hand and feet which is improved and stable.
   - follow as outpt
   .
   # Rash: Possible reaction to ceftriaxone.  Dermatology was consulted at
   OSH due to concern for [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2527**] [**Location (un) **].  Started on solumedrol which
   was being tapered.  Rash improving.
   - Continue steroid taper once discussed with surgery
   .
   # Anxiety:
   - Cont. ativan and effexor once not NPO
   .
   FEN: NPO for now, IVF
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] restart heparin if no surgery planned
   -Bowel regimen on hold
   -Pain management with morphine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of CNS Lyme disease who presents to the ICU with leukocytosis, abdominal pain, hypotension, and concern for acute abdomen.

Summary of the patient's condition:

* The patient has a diffuse maculo-papular rash over her entire body, excluding the area surrounding her lips and the face.
* She has a history of CNS Lyme disease, for which she received 4 weeks of ceftriaxone treatment.
* The patient has a leukocytosis, which peaked at 20.8 at OSH and is currently 13.3.
* She has a history of abdominal pain, which is diffuse and tender to palpation, with no guarding or rebound tenderness.
* The patient has a hypotension, which is currently stable after fluid resuscitation.
* She has a CT scan at OSH showing a possible PE, which is being held due to the risk of bleeding in the setting of possible procedure.
* The patient has a history of anxiety and is taking Ativan and Effexor.

Potential medical complications:

1. Abdominal sepsis: Given the patient's leukocytosis and abdominal pain, there is a high risk of abdominal sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and hypotension make sepsis a potential complication, which can lead to organ failure and death.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE at OSH, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
4. C. difficile infection: Given the patient's recent antibiotics course and leukocytosis, there is a risk of C. difficile infection, which can lead to colitis and death.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of abdominal pain and bleeding risk make gastrointestinal bleeding a potential complication, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypotension and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute make respiratory failure a potential complication, which can lead to death.

Assessment and plan:

* The patient's abdominal pain and leukocytosis make sepsis and abdominal sepsis potential complications.
* The patient's history of PE at OSH makes pulmonary embolism a potential complication.
* The patient's recent antibiotics course and leukocytosis make C. difficile infection a potential complication.
* The patient's history of abdominal pain and bleeding risk make gastrointestinal bleeding a potential complication.
* The patient's hypotension and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute make respiratory failure a potential complication.
* The patient will continue to receive IVF, antibiotics, and pain management as per the plan.
* The patient will be closely monitored for any signs of sepsis, abdominal sepsis, pulmonary embolism, C. difficile infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and respiratory failure.
* The patient's code status is full code."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  53 y/o F with PMH of CNS lyme who presents from
   OSH with leukocytosis, abdominal pain, hypotension and concern for
   acute abdomen.
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Differential is broad including gastritis, PUD,
   perforated ulcer, pancreatitis, colitis.  Abdominal pain is fairly
   diffuse, however her abdomen is soft.  There was concern for free air
   at OSH, unfortunately we do not have the data here to confirm this. At
   OSH the patient's abdomen was reportedly rigid and there was concern
   for an acute process which prompted urgent transfer for possible
   surgery.  At this point she is hemodynamically stable and her exam is
   not concerning for peritoneal signs.  Surgery is following closely.
   Patient has been on high-dose steroids so an ulcer is possible, however
   was on GI ppx at OSH with Pepsid.  KUB was also concerning for possible
   obstruction.  Labs here show LFTs and pancreatic enzymes wnl making
   pancreatitis less likely.  C. diff is of concern given recent long
   antibiotics course and leukocytosis, however was neg. x 1 at OSH.
   - Repeat abdominal CT now with oral/IV contrast to look for acute
   pathology, r/o free air and look for obstruction.
   - Surgery co-managing and appreciate their input
   - Will cont. cipro/flagyl and add vanco.
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - Pain control with IV morphine
   - Follow LFTs, pancreatic enzymes
   - PPI gtt for now
   - Consider GI consult for EGD if PUD remains high on differential
   - NPO for now
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes sepsis, bleeding, volume
   depletion, toxic shock.  Given leukocytosis an infection is high on the
   differential.  Hct here also lower (23.7 from 29.6 this morning at
   OSH).  Given abdominal tenderness, this is concerning for bleed.  BP
   stable with IVF currently.
   - Cont. IVF boluses to maintain MAP>60 and UOP>30
   - Consider pressors if unable to maintain with IVF
   - Trend serial Hct and transfuse if dropping or <21
   - CIS
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Improving.  Peaked at OSH this morning at 20.8.
   Currently 13, however this is after abx since this am.  Sources include
   abdomen, line-infection, urine, lungs.  Cultures at OSH reportedly
   negative, however UA there showed 1+ bacteria and [**4-16**] WBC.  Given
   recent antibiotics, diarrhea and abdominal pain, c. diff is of
   concern.  Was neg. x1 at OSH.  CT at OSH also concerning for PNA,
   however patient does not have cough and lungs are clear.  Has low grade
   fever here.
   - f/u OSH culture data
   - f/u CT read here for possible abdominal source
   - CIS
   - Cont. vanc/cipro/flagyl per surgery recommendation
   - Add on differential
   .
   # PE: CTA confirmed PE at OSH, was on Arixtra, last dose this morning.
   Unclear what precipitated this exept for risk factor of being
   hospitalized.  No h/o malignancy, has been getting routine mom[**Name (NI) 5369**]
   and Paps, has not had colonoscopy.  No personal or fam hx. of clot, not
   on HRT.
   - Holding anticoagulation for now in setting of possible procedure
   - Attempt to obtain OSH CT films to confirm PE
   .
   #. CNS Lyme: Received 4 weeks of ceftriaxone for this per her
   Neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5370**].  Per notes from ID consult at OSH, the diagnosis
   of this is in question based on her CSF results. Reports a history of
   neuropathy in her hand and feet which is improved and stable.
   - Cont. to follow
   .
   # Rash: Possible reaction to ceftriaxone.  Dermatology was consulted at
   OSH due to concern for [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2527**] [**Location (un) **].  Started on solumedrol which
   was being tapered.  Rash improving.
   - Continue steroid taper once discussed with surgery
   .
   # Anxiety:
   - Cont. ativan and effexor once not NPO
   .
   FEN: NPO for now, IVF
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] restart heparin if no surgery planned

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a past medical history of CNS Lyme disease, who presents to the ICU with leukocytosis, abdominal pain, hypotension, and concern for acute abdomen.

The patient has received various medications, including antibiotics, steroids, and pain management medications. She has a multi-lumen catheter in place and is receiving IV fluids.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 111/54 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 13.8 K/μL, and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. Her hemoglobin level is 9.9 g/dL, and her platelet count is 276 K/μL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's abdominal pain is diffuse, and her abdomen is soft. She has a history of abdominal tenderness and has been diagnosed with a possible perforated ulcer. The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, bleeding, or volume depletion.

The patient's leukocytosis is improving, and her cultures at OSH were negative. However, she has a history of diarrhea and abdominal pain, which may be related to Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection.

The patient has a confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) and is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She is receiving anticoagulation therapy, but it is being held due to the possibility of a procedure.

The patient's rash is improving, and she is receiving steroid tapering. She has a history of neuropathy in her hand and feet, which is stable and improving.

The patient's anxiety is being managed with medication, and she is receiving IV fluids and pain management medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's leukocytosis, abdominal pain, and hypotension, sepsis is a potential complication.
2. Bleeding: The patient's hypotension and abdominal tenderness may indicate bleeding, which could worsen her condition.
3. C. diff infection: The patient's diarrhea and abdominal pain may be related to C. diff infection, which could lead to severe colitis and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. PE: The patient's confirmed PE is a significant risk factor for further complications, including pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure.
5. DVT: The patient's risk for DVT is high due to her PE and immobility, which could lead to further complications, including pulmonary embolism and leg swelling.
6. Steroid-induced complications: The patient's steroid tapering may lead to complications, including adrenal insufficiency, osteoporosis, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of neuropathy and her current condition may lead to further neurological complications, including numbness, weakness, or paralysis.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status. The patient should receive aggressive treatment for her sepsis, bleeding, and C. diff infection, and her anticoagulation therapy should be closely monitored. The patient's steroid tapering should be continued, and her neurological status should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening neuropathy."

   Assessment and Plan
ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING):
   Transfused 2 units pRBCs with appropriate bump in Hct.
   Hemmodynamically stable this morning. Unclear whether this was related
   to a perforated duodenal ulcer, course not consistent albeit some
   symptoms may be masked on steroids.  Also may have had a spontaneous
   retroperitoneal bleed on antiocoagulation for possible PE.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK):  In setting of acute blood loss and
   hypovolemia, responsive to blood transfusions and IVF resusitation.
   Also concerned for early sepsis, most likely source would be the
   abdomen.  Positive UA.  Now on vanco/cipro/flagyl. Had 3 sets of blood
   cultures and urine culture at the outside hospital no growth to date.
   Continue antibiotics.
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE:  Unclear that she has had a PE,
   reports from the outside hospital inconsistent documenting RUL and then
   RLL embolism, now holding anticoagulation in setting of acute blood
   loss.  Awaiting outside hospital films.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN):  Adequately controlled on
   morphine IV
 DIFFUSE RASH:  Rash seems most consistent with drug reaction related
   to CTX.  No oral lesions on exam here.  Steroids discontinued.
 CNS LYME DISEASE:  Has completed a course of CTX for presumed lyme.
 RIGHT IJ from outside hospital to be discontinued.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions and complications. The patient's chief complaint is acute bleeding, and the note highlights the following key points:

1. The patient underwent a multi-lumen procedure and was found to have a fluid collection around the 3rd and 4th portion of the duodenum, which is concerning for acute bleeding.
2. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and intravenous fluids (IVF) for hypotension, which was responsive to treatment.
3. The patient has a diffuse maculopapular rash, which is suspected to be a drug reaction related to ceftriaxone (CTX).
4. The patient has a history of chronic pain and is being managed with morphine IV.
5. The patient has a history of lyme disease and completed a course of CTX for presumed lyme disease.
6. The patient has a right internal jugular (IJ) line from the outside hospital that is to be discontinued.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient's acute bleeding and hypovolemia may lead to hemorrhagic shock, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
2. Sepsis: The patient's positive urine analysis and antibiotic treatment suggest the possibility of early sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not managed effectively.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's history of PE and anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Drug reaction: The patient's diffuse maculopapular rash may indicate a drug reaction, which can be severe and life-threatening if not treated promptly.
5. Chronic pain management: The patient's chronic pain requires ongoing management, and the risk of opioid dependence and addiction is a concern.
6. Lymphedema: The patient's history of lyme disease and completed course of CTX may increase the risk of lymphedema, which can lead to chronic swelling and skin breakdown.

In summary, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical conditions and complications, and ongoing monitoring and management are essential to prevent further complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

   53 y/o F with PMH of CNS lyme who presents from OSH with leukocytosis,
   abdominal pain, hypotension and concern for acute abdomen.
   # Abdominal pain: Differential is broad including gastritis, PUD,
   perforated ulcer, pancreatitis, colitis.  Abdominal pain is fairly
   diffuse, however her abdomen is soft.  There was concern for free air
   at OSH, unfortunately we do not have the data here to confirm this. At
   OSH the patient's abdomen was reportedly rigid and there was concern
   for an acute process which prompted urgent transfer for possible
   surgery.  At this point she is hemodynamically stable and her exam is
   not concerning for peritoneal signs.  Surgery is following closely.
   Patient has been on high-dose steroids so an ulcer is possible, however
   was on GI ppx at OSH with Pepsid.  KUB was also concerning for possible
   obstruction.  Labs here show LFTs and pancreatic enzymes wnl making
   pancreatitis less likely.  C. diff is of concern given recent long
   antibiotics course and leukocytosis, however was neg. x 1 at OSH.
   - Surgery wants GI to scope to provide evidence for/against
   intraluminal cause
 PUD, etc., such that if positive will proceed w/
   surgery, if negative will proceed with angiography for RP bleed
   - GI: scoping this AM
   - will discuss final management plan in coordination w/ GI and Surgery
   - continue serial abd exams
   - continue PPI gtt
   - Cipro/flagyl and Vanco ppx, day#2
   - obtain OSH records
   # Hypotension: Differential includes sepsis, bleeding, volume
   depletion, toxic shock.  Given leukocytosis an infection is high on the
   differential.  No no longer hypotensive after fluid resuscitaiton
   - Cont. IVF boluses to maintain MAP>60 and UOP>30
   - Consider pressors if unable to maintain with IVF
   - Hct q6
   - CIS
   # Leukocytosis: Improving.  Peaked at OSH this morning at 20.8.
   Currently 13, however this is after abx since this am.  Sources include
   abdomen, line-infection, urine, lungs.  Cultures at OSH reportedly
   negative, however UA there showed 1+ bacteria and [**4-16**] WBC.  Given
   recent antibiotics, diarrhea and abdominal pain, c. diff is of
   concern.  Was neg. x1 at OSH.  CT at OSH also concerning for PNA,
   however patient does not have cough and lungs are clear.  Has low grade
   fever here.
   - f/u OSH culture data
   - f/u CT read here for possible abdominal source
   - CIS
   - Cont. vanc/cipro/flagyl per surgery recommendation
   - Add on differential
   # PE: CTA confirmed PE at OSH, was on Arixtra, last dose this morning.
   Unclear what precipitated this exept for risk factor of being
   hospitalized.  No h/o malignancy, has been getting routine mom[**Name (NI) 5369**]
   and Paps, has not had colonoscopy.  No personal or fam hx. of clot, not
   on HRT.
   - Holding anticoagulation for now in setting of possible procedure
   - Attempt to obtain OSH CT films to confirm PE
   #. CNS Lyme: Received 4 weeks of ceftriaxone for this per her
   Neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5370**].  Per notes from ID consult at OSH, the diagnosis
   of this is in question based on her CSF results. Reports a history of
   neuropathy in her hand and feet which is improved and stable.
   - follow as outpt
   # Rash: Possible reaction to ceftriaxone.  Dermatology was consulted at
   OSH due to concern for [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2527**] [**Location (un) **].  Started on solumedrol which
   was being tapered.  Rash improving.
   - Continue steroid taper once discussed with surgery
   # Anxiety:
   - Cont. ativan and effexor once not NPO
   FEN: NPO for now, IVF
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] restart heparin if no surgery planned
   -Bowel regimen on hold
   -Pain management with morphine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   53 y/o F with PMH of CNS lyme who presents from OSH with leukocytosis,
   abdominal pain, hypotension and concern for acute abdomen.
   # Abdominal pain: Differential is broad including gastritis, PUD,
   perforated ulcer, pancreatitis, colitis.  Abdominal pain is fairly
   diffuse, however her abdomen is soft.  There was concern for free air
   at OSH, unfortunately we do not have the data here to confirm this. At
   OSH the patient's abdomen was reportedly rigid and there was concern
   for an acute process which prompted urgent transfer for possible
   surgery.  At this point she is hemodynamically stable and her exam is
   not concerning for peritoneal signs.  Surgery is following closely.
   Patient has been on high-dose steroids so an ulcer is possible, however
   was on GI ppx at OSH with Pepsid.  KUB was also concerning for possible
   obstruction.  Labs here show LFTs and pancreatic enzymes wnl making
   pancreatitis less likely.  C. diff is of concern given recent long
   antibiotics course and leukocytosis, however was neg. x 1 at OSH.
   - Surgery wants GI to scope to provide evidence for/against
   intraluminal cause
 PUD, etc., such that if positive will proceed w/
   surgery, if negative will proceed with angiography for RP bleed
   - GI: scoping this AM
   - will discuss final management plan in coordination w/ GI and Surgery
   - continue serial abd exams
   - continue PPI gtt
   - Cipro/flagyl and Vanco ppx, day#2
   - obtain OSH records
   # Hypotension: Differential includes sepsis, bleeding, volume
   depletion, toxic shock.  Given leukocytosis an infection is high on the
   differential.  No no longer hypotensive after fluid resuscitaiton
   - Cont. IVF boluses to maintain MAP>60 and UOP>30
   - Consider pressors if unable to maintain with IVF
   - Hct q6
   - CIS
   # Leukocytosis: Improving.  Peaked at OSH this morning at 20.8.
   Currently 13, however this is after abx since this am.  Sources include
   abdomen, line-infection, urine, lungs.  Cultures at OSH reportedly
   negative, however UA there showed 1+ bacteria and [**4-16**] WBC.  Given
   recent antibiotics, diarrhea and abdominal pain, c. diff is of
   concern.  Was neg. x1 at OSH.  CT at OSH also concerning for PNA,
   however patient does not have cough and lungs are clear.  Has low grade
   fever here.
   - f/u OSH culture data
   - f/u CT read here for possible abdominal source
   - CIS
   - Cont. vanc/cipro/flagyl per surgery recommendation
   - Add on differential
   # PE: CTA confirmed PE at OSH, was on Arixtra, last dose this morning.
   Unclear what precipitated this exept for risk factor of being
   hospitalized.  No h/o malignancy, has been getting routine mom[**Name (NI) 5369**]
   and Paps, has not had colonoscopy.  No personal or fam hx. of clot, not
   on HRT.
   - Holding anticoagulation for now in setting of possible procedure
   - Attempt to obtain OSH CT films to confirm PE
   #. CNS Lyme: Received 4 weeks of ceftriaxone for this per her
   Neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5370**].  Per notes from ID consult at OSH, the diagnosis
   of this is in question based on her CSF results. Reports a history of
   neuropathy in her hand and feet which is improved and stable.
   - follow as outpt
   # Rash: Possible reaction to ceftriaxone.  Dermatology was consulted at
   OSH due to concern for [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2527**] [**Location (un) **].  Started on solumedrol which
   was being tapered.  Rash improving.
   - Continue steroid taper once discussed with surgery
   # Anxiety:
   - Cont. ativan and effexor once not NPO
   FEN: NPO for now, IVF
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] restart heparin if no surgery planned
   -Bowel regimen on hold
   -Pain management with morphine

Based on the provided daily progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Central Nervous System (CNS) Lyme disease who presents to the hospital with leukocytosis, abdominal pain, hypotension, and concern for acute abdomen. She has undergone an emergency computed tomography (CT) scan, which revealed a pulmonary embolism (PE) and diffuse edema in the duodenum on endoscopy.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.2°F (38.4°C)
* Heart rate: 109 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 118/59 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%

Her physical examination reveals a diffuse maculo-papular rash over her entire body, except for the area surrounding her lips, face, and back. Her abdomen is soft, diffusely tender to palpation, with no rebound or guarding.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 13.8 K/μL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 23.7%
* Platelet count (Plt): 82 K/μL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 28 mg/dL
* Serum glucose: 108 mg/dL

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain management medication, and proton pump inhibitors.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's leukocytosis and hypotension, there is a risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's PE may worsen or extend to other parts of the lung, leading to respiratory failure.
3. Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS): The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness may worsen, leading to ACS, which can cause organ dysfunction and death.
4. Infection: The patient's diffuse maculo-papular rash and leukocytosis suggest a possible infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and lead to sepsis.
5. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and history of bleeding may increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hematuria.
6. Liver or kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and creatinine levels may indicate liver or kidney dysfunction, which can worsen with time.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's PE and respiratory rate may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.

To address these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored and managed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Further diagnostic testing, such as imaging studies and cultures, may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms and guide treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient, a 53-year-old female with a past medical history of CNS lyme, presented to the emergency department with leukocytosis, abdominal pain, hypotension, and concern for acute abdomen. She was treated with antibiotics and had an EGD, which revealed diffuse edema in the duodenum but no evidence of fresh bleeding. She was also found to have a pulmonary embolism (PE) confirmed by CT angiogram.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Leukocytosis, which peaked at 20.8 K/uL and is now improving
* Anemia, which is secondary to blood loss
* Hypotension, which has resolved and is now stable
* Elevated liver enzymes, including ALT and AST
* Elevated troponin-T levels
* Elevated creatinine levels
* Elevated lipase levels

The patient's medications include:

* Vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole for antibiotic coverage
* Pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Morphine sulfate for pain management
* Ativan and effexor for anxiety management

The patient's physical examination shows:

* A diffuse maculo-papular rash over her entire body, sparing the area surrounding her lips and the areas of confluence on her face and back
* Hyperactive bowel sounds
* Soft, diffusely tender abdomen with no rebound or guarding
* Normal cardiac examination
* Normal lung examination
* Normal neurologic examination

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis due to the patient's leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes
* Bleeding complications due to the patient's anemia and elevated troponin-T levels
* Pulmonary embolism complications, such as respiratory failure or cardiac arrest
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation or bleeding, due to the patient's abdominal pain and hyperactive bowel sounds
* Skin complications, such as infection or allergic reactions, due to the patient's rash and antibiotic therapy
* Neurologic complications, such as seizures or stroke, due to the patient's elevated troponin-T levels and history of CNS lyme."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mrs [**Known lastname 5397**], and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 5397**] has had an IVC filter placed without difficulty and has had
   stabilization of her Hct without further transfusion. her rash appeart
   to be responding to prednisone and she still complains of abdominal
   pain. CT scan has shown significant intra-peritoneal
   bleed around duodenum and into both paracolic gutters and pelvis.
   Exam notable for Tmof 102.6 BP118/59 HR of 103 RR of 22 with sats of
   96% on 3lpm O2 . She has a diffuse maculopapular rash that appears to
   be resolving. her abdomen is still tender to touch.
    Labs notable for WBC of 10K, HCTof 28.5 , K+of 4 , Crof 0.5 , LDH of
   305, lactate of less than 2. CXR with bilateral small effusions but no
   infiltrate.
   Agree with plan to advance diet slowly as tolerated, discontinue Rt IJ
   line ( per ICU policy) and check caloric counts. She may need short
   term TPN until PO intake has improved. Prednisone will be continued
   till rash has resolved and Eos have decreased.
   IV PPI to be continued on a [**Hospital1 **] basis and she will be transitioned to a
   chair today. if she has no setback over next 24 hrs, we will consider
   transfer to surgical service on regular floor in am [**3-5**]
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   53 y/o F with PMH of CNS lyme who presents from OSH with leukocytosis,
   abdominal pain, hypotension and concern for acute abdomen.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   # Abdominal pain: likely due to compression of retroperitoneal hematoma
   on celiac plexus. Appears that this may have occurred in the setting of
   falling while on fondaparinux.
   - EGD did not reveal cause of bleeding
   - Surgery has no plan for intervention
   - continue serial abd exams, serial lactates
   - continue PPI
   - Cipro/flagyl and Vanco ppx, day#3
   # Hypotension resolved. Likely due to blood loss. Now with stable hct x
   several days.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct check
   # Leukocytosis: Improving.  Peaked at OSH this morning at 20.8.
   - F/u micro
   - f/u OSH culture data
   - f/u CT read here for possible abdominal source
   - CIS
   - Cont. vanc/cipro/flagyl per surgery recommendation
   - Add on differential
   # PE: CTA confirmed PE at OSH, was on [**Name (NI) 5396**],  Unclear what
   precipitated this except for risk factor of being hospitalized.  No h/o
   malignancy, has been getting routine mammogram and Paps, has not had
   colonoscopy.  No personal or fam hx. of clot, not on HRT.
   - Holding anticoagulation for now in setting of bleeding
   - S/p IVC filter on [**3-3**]
   #. CNS Lyme: Received 4 weeks of ceftriaxone for this per her
   Neurologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5370**].  Per notes from ID consult at OSH, the diagnosis
   of this is in question based on her CSF results. Reports a history of
   neuropathy in her hand and feet which is improved and stable.
   - follow as outpt
   # Rash: Possible reaction to ceftriaxone.  Dermatology was consulted at
   OSH due to concern for [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2527**] [**Location (un) 744**].  Started on solumedrol which
   was being tapered.  Rash improving.
   - Continue steroid taper once discussed with surgery
   # Anxiety:
   - Cont. ativan and effexor
   FEN: ADAT as no procedures planned.
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with IVC filter.
   -Bowel regimen on hold
   -Pain management with ultram as pt getting GI upset and hallucinations
   on morphine
   ACCESS: will take out R IJ from OSH,  likely need central access

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Mrs [**Known lastname 5397**], and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 5397**] has had an IVC filter placed without difficulty and has had
   stabilization of her Hct without further transfusion. her rash appeart
   to be responding to prednisone and she still complains of abdominal
   pain. CT scan has shown significant intra-peritoneal
   bleed around duodenum and into both paracolic gutters and pelvis.
   Exam notable for Tmof 102.6 BP118/59 HR of 103 RR of 22 with sats of
   96% on 3lpm O2 . She has a diffuse maculopapular rash that appears to
   be resolving. her abdomen is still tender to touch.
    Labs notable for WBC of 10K, HCTof 28.5 , K+of 4 , Crof 0.5 , LDH of
   305, lactate of less than 2. CXR with bilateral small effusions but no
   infiltrate.
   Agree with plan to advance diet slowly as tolerated, discontinue Rt IJ
   line ( per ICU policy) and check caloric counts. She may need short
   term TPN until PO intake has improved. Prednisone will be continued
   till rash has resolved and Eos have decreased.
   IV PPI to be continued on a [**Hospital1 **] basis and she will be transitioned to a
   chair today. if she has no setback over next 24 hrs, we will consider
   transfer to surgical service on regular floor in am [**3-5**]
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is ill

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of CNS Lyme disease and is currently experiencing leukocytosis, which can lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of hypotension and is currently experiencing stable blood pressure, but this can change rapidly. The patient's history of bleeding and the presence of an IVC filter may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of abdominal pain and has undergone an EGD, which may have caused further bleeding or complications. The patient's current abdominal tenderness and the presence of intra-peritoneal bleed may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as perforation or obstruction.
4. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of CNS Lyme disease and is currently experiencing a diffuse maculopapular rash, which may be a sign of a neurological complication such as meningitis or encephalitis.
5. Infection complications: The patient has a history of bleeding and is currently receiving antibiotics, which may increase the risk of infection complications such as sepsis or septic shock.
6. Hematological complications: The patient has a history of bleeding and is currently experiencing anemia, which may increase the risk of hematological complications such as bleeding or transfusion reactions.
7. Endocrine complications: The patient is receiving corticosteroids for the treatment of rash, which may cause endocrine complications such as hyperglycemia or adrenal insufficiency.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to monitor her closely for any signs of complications and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a past medical history of CNS Lyme disease who was admitted to the ICU with leukocytosis, abdominal pain, hypotension, and concern for acute abdomen. She was treated conservatively for a possible gastrointestinal bleed and a retroperitoneal bleed. Her hypotension resolved, and her leukocytosis is improving. She has a confirmed pulmonary embolism (PE) and was placed on anticoagulation therapy. She also has a central line infection and was started on antibiotics. She is being treated for a rash, which is thought to be a reaction to ceftriaxone. She is experiencing anxiety and is being treated with ativan and effexor.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's abdominal pain and bleeding may lead to further complications such as perforation, abscess formation, or sepsis.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's PE may lead to further complications such as pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, or death.
3. Central line infection: The patient's central line infection may lead to sepsis, bacteremia, or endocarditis.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may lead to further complications such as sepsis, respiratory failure, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may lead to further complications such as organ failure, shock, or death.
6. Rash: The patient's rash may lead to further complications such as allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, or skin necrosis.
7. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety may lead to further complications such as panic attacks, insomnia, or depression.
8. CNS Lyme disease: The patient's CNS Lyme disease may lead to further complications such as meningitis, encephalitis, or seizures.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and treat accordingly.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's pulmonary embolism and treat accordingly.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's central line infection and treat accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's leukocytosis and treat accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's hypotension and treat accordingly.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's rash and treat accordingly.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's anxiety and treat accordingly.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's CNS Lyme disease and treat accordingly.

Note: The above summary and recommendations are based on the provided information and may not be exhaustive. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary based on the patient's clinical presentation and response to therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of CNS Lyme disease who was admitted to the hospital with leukocytosis, abdominal pain, hypotension, and concern for acute abdomen. She has undergone various tests and treatments, including EGD, CTA, and IVF. Her condition has been stable, with improving leukocytosis and resolution of hypotension. She has developed a rash, which is believed to be a possible reaction to ceftriaxone. She is being treated with various medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and prophylaxis for DVT and VAP.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Infection:** The patient's leukocytosis and abdominal pain suggest the possibility of an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. **Bleeding:** The patient's history of bleeding, including the recent episode of tachycardia and hypotension, suggests the possibility of ongoing bleeding or bleeding complications, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
3. **Thrombosis:** The patient's history of DVT and PE suggests the possibility of ongoing thrombotic complications, which could lead to further thrombotic events, such as stroke or pulmonary embolism.
4. **Rash:** The patient's rash, which is believed to be a possible reaction to ceftriaxone, could lead to further complications, such as skin infection or allergic reactions.
5. **CNS Lyme disease:** The patient's history of CNS Lyme disease suggests the possibility of ongoing neurological complications, such as meningitis or encephalitis, which could lead to further neurological deficits or even death.
6. **Pain management:** The patient's pain management regimen, including opioids and non-opioids, could lead to further complications, such as addiction, respiratory depression, or gastrointestinal upset.
7. **Nutrition:** The patient's nutrition regimen, including enteral feeding, could lead to further complications, such as malnutrition, dehydration, or electrolyte imbalances.
8. **Glycemic control:** The patient's glycemic control, including insulin and glucose monitoring, could lead to further complications, such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
9. **Central access:** The patient's need for central access, including central lines and IVC filters, could lead to further complications, such as infection, bleeding, or thrombosis.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications, and to ensure optimal outcomes."
