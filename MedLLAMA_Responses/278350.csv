You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of SLE and lupus nephritis, presenting with a febrile seizure and subsequent diagnosis of sepsis, septic emboli, and embolic infarcts. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and is receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and vasopressors.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Endocarditis: Given the patient's history of rheumatic heart disease and the presence of septic emboli, there is a high likelihood of endocarditis, which can lead to further complications such as valve damage, abscesses, and systemic emboli.
2. Hemolysis: The patient's decreasing hemoglobin levels and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) suggest the possibility of hemolysis, which can be caused by septic emboli, hemolytic uremic syndrome, or other underlying conditions.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's increasing creatinine levels and low urine output suggest AKI, which can be caused by sepsis, hypotension, or other underlying conditions.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis, likely caused by lactate and infectious etiology, can lead to further complications such as cardiovascular instability, respiratory failure, and multi-organ dysfunction.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of sepsis increase the risk of respiratory failure, which can be further complicated by pneumonia, pleural effusions, or other respiratory conditions.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of seizures and the presence of septic emboli increase the risk of neurological complications such as stroke, cerebral edema, or meningitis.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and need for vasopressors increase the risk of cardiovascular instability, which can lead to further complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting treatment accordingly to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   57F with h/o SLE c/b nephritis presenting with febrile seizure.
   # Seizure - ddx includes infection, toxic/metabolic, intracranial
   process (evidence of prior ischemia on CT HEAD).  given fever,
   leukocytosis, bandemia, an infectious etiology, particularly
   meningitis, seems most likely.  No other foci of infection presently
   (CXR with LLL atelectasis, UA weakly+).  Urine tox screen negative.
   CT HEAD without bleeding or mass, though old evidence of infarcts.
   Would proceed as follows:
   - appreciate neuro recs.
   - dilantin load not completed in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will recheck dilantin level now
   and re-load.
   - continue dilatinin 100mg IV Q8HR (next dose 8 HRS after load), check
   dilantin level prior to next dose (check LFTs, albumin).
   - plan for MRI/MRA in AM, preferably with Gadolinium per NEURO, but if
   not possible, ok to get without.
   - no EEG for now (clear clinical history), will check if evidence of
   ongoing seizure activity.
   - continue acyclovir.
   - start empiric listeria coverage pending culture data.
   - add-on LFTs, check UCx, DFA, trend lactate in AM.
   - stop coumadin, start heparin gtt, anticipate reversing INR with FFP
   for LP in AM (?with IR given anticoagulation issues), however given
   mechanical MVR, will discuss optimal strategy with cardiology in AM
   (courtesy).
   - check CDIFF given ?loose stool (covered in stool)
   - check TTE given fever, prosthetic valves.
   - check CK given seizure and ARF.
   .
   .
   # Hyponatremia - likely dehydrated in setting of fevers, will hydrate
   overnight as above, and follow in AM.
   - check Sosm, Uosm, Ulytes in AM.
   .
   # Hypotension - relative hypotension after getting propofol in ED, now
   with BPs trending down to high 90s after 4-5L IVF.  most likely
   represents septic physiology, though both propofol and dilantin can
   also cause hypotension.
   - continue IVF resuscitation (lactate responded nicely to IVF).
   - place a-line now.
   - if remains borderline hypotensive, will place CVL in AM.
   - continue broad spectrum abx.
   - cycle HCT in AM.
   .
   # Anemia - baseline low 32-33, up to 34 on admission, now 29, in
   setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - cycle HCT in AM.
   - guaic stools.
   .
   # metabolic acidosis - likely [**2-7**] lactate and infectious etiology,
   lactate trending down with IVF, with appropriate respiratory
   compensation.
   - repeat CHEM7 in AM.
   - repeat ABG in AM.
   .
   # SLE c/b lupus nephritis - not particularly active per last rheum note
   from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9213**].
   - continue plaquenil.
   .
   # Rheumatic heart disease, s/p AVR, MVR - clinically euvolemic on exam.
   - hold coumadin.
   - start heparin gtt.
   - touch base with cardiology in AM (courtesy) re stopping coumadin for
   LP.
   - TTE in AM given prosthetic valves (old), fever.
   .
   # HTN - hold coreg, valsartan and lisinopril given hypotension and mild
   ARF.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   57F with h/o SLE c/b nephritis presenting with febrile seizure.
   # Seizure - ddx includes infection, toxic/metabolic, intracranial
   process (evidence of prior ischemia on CT HEAD).  given fever,
   leukocytosis, bandemia, an infectious etiology, particularly
   meningitis, seems most likely.  No other foci of infection presently
   (CXR with LLL atelectasis, UA weakly+).  Urine tox screen negative.
   CT HEAD without bleeding or mass, though old evidence of infarcts.
   Would proceed as follows:
   - appreciate neuro recs.
   - dilantin load not completed in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will recheck dilantin level now
   and re-load.
   - continue dilatinin 100mg IV Q8HR (next dose 8 HRS after load), check
   dilantin level prior to next dose (check LFTs, albumin).
   - plan for MRI/MRA in AM, preferably with Gadolinium per NEURO, but if
   not possible, ok to get without.
   - no EEG for now (clear clinical history), will check if evidence of
   ongoing seizure activity.
   - continue acyclovir.
   - start empiric listeria coverage pending culture data.
   - add-on LFTs, check UCx, DFA, trend lactate in AM.
   - stop coumadin, start heparin gtt, anticipate reversing INR with FFP
   for LP in AM (?with IR given anticoagulation issues), however given
   mechanical MVR, will discuss optimal strategy with cardiology in AM
   (courtesy).
   - check CDIFF given ?loose stool (covered in stool)
   - check TTE given fever, prosthetic valves.
   - check CK given seizure and ARF.
   .
   .
   # Hyponatremia - likely dehydrated in setting of fevers, will hydrate
   overnight as above, and follow in AM.
   - check Sosm, Uosm, Ulytes in AM.
   .
   # Hypotension - relative hypotension after getting propofol in ED, now
   with BPs trending down to high 90s after 4-5L IVF.  most likely
   represents septic physiology, though both propofol and dilantin can
   also cause hypotension.
   - continue IVF resuscitation (lactate responded nicely to IVF).
   - place a-line now.
   - if remains borderline hypotensive, will place CVL in AM.
   - continue broad spectrum abx.
   - cycle HCT in AM.
   .
   # Anemia - baseline low 32-33, up to 34 on admission, now 29, in
   setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - cycle HCT in AM.
   - guaic stools.
   .
   # metabolic acidosis - likely [**2-7**] lactate and infectious etiology,
   lactate trending down with IVF, with appropriate respiratory
   compensation.
   - repeat CHEM7 in AM.
   - repeat ABG in AM.
   .
   # SLE c/b lupus nephritis - not particularly active per last rheum note
   from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9213**].
   - continue plaquenil.
   .
   # Rheumatic heart disease, s/p AVR, MVR - clinically euvolemic on exam.
   - hold coumadin.
   - start heparin gtt.
   - touch base with cardiology in AM (courtesy) re stopping coumadin for
   LP.
   - TTE in AM given prosthetic valves (old), fever.
   .
   # HTN - hold coreg, valsartan and lisinopril given hypotension and mild
   ARF.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis, who presented with a febrile seizure and was found to have multiple cortical infarcts on MRI. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has been receiving various medications, including anticonvulsants, antibiotics, and anticoagulants.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.3°F, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 83/52 mmHg. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological examination is notable for minimal arousal to sternal rub, and the patient withdraws to pain minimally.

The patient's laboratory results are notable for a white blood cell count of 24.6, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 121. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a sodium level of 139 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, and chloride level of 17.4 mEq/L. The patient's creatinine level is 1.7 mg/dL, and the patient's lactate level is 1.4 mmol/L.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

1. Infection: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia suggest the possibility of an infection, which could be related to the patient's underlying SLE or a secondary infection.
2. Seizure: The patient's history of febrile seizure and the presence of cortical infarcts on MRI suggest the possibility of ongoing seizure activity.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactate level is elevated, which could be related to the patient's underlying illness or a secondary complication.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which could be related to the patient's underlying illness, the use of propofol and dilantin, or septic physiology.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which could be related to the patient's underlying illness or blood loss.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, which could be related to the patient's underlying illness or dehydration.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of rheumatic heart disease and has undergone cardiac surgery, which could increase the risk of cardiac complications.
8. Renal complications: The patient has a history of lupus nephritis, which could increase the risk of renal complications.

Based on the patient's laboratory results and clinical presentation, the patient's potential medical complications include infection, seizure, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, anemia, hyponatremia, cardiac complications, and renal complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   57F with h/o SLE c/b nephritis presenting with febrile seizure.
   # Sepsis
 Staph aureus in [**4-9**] blood cx bottles from ED [**6-7**]. MRI
   consistent with embolic shower.  LP by IR showed WBC of 345.  This
   likely due to septic emboli and likely embolic infarcts explains
   seizures.
   - check TEE given fever, and high likelihood of endocarditis given
   embolic shower on MRI.
   - Continue Vanc, Amp, CTX, add gent for synergy. D/C acv as low
   likelihood of HSV and poor creatinine clearance
   -  f/u blood cx and sensitivities (MRSA swab from nose positive so
   higher likelihood it will be MRSA)
   - fluids and pressors to maintain MAP>65
   - F/U CSF cultures
   - contact cardiac surgery if not done yet
   # Seizures
 likely explained by septic emboli. LP by IR with elevated
   WBC.
   - appreciate neuro recs.
   - dilantin loaded here and will have level this AM
   - Continue empiric listeria coverage pending culture data.
   - f/u CSF cx.
   - Goal SBP 100-160
   # Hypotension
 Etiology secondary to sepsis. BPs trending down to high
   90s after 4-5L IVF in ED.  CVL was placed and aggressive fluid
   resuscitation was intiated however she required levophed to maintain
   SBP 100-160 per neuro recs.  .
   - CVL and A-line in place.
   - continue pressor support as needed
   - continue broad spectrum abx.
   # Respiratory
 Oxygenating well. Will decrease FiO2. Over-breathing
   vent
   - Daily wake ups and RSBI if appropriate.
   # ARF: Baseline cr of 1.2-1.7 and currently up slightly to 2.1.
   - Continue aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - monitor UOP and Cr
   - D/C ACV
   - F/U Renal recs
   .
   # Anemia - baseline low 32-33, but trending down to 25.5 this AM in
   setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation.  [**Month (only) 60**] be concern for
   hemolysis, but no schistocytes on smear and Haptoglobin <20.
   - cycle HCT Q8H
   - guaic stools.
   .
   # metabolic acidosis - likely [**2-7**] lactate and infectious etiology,
   lactate trending down with IVF, with appropriate respiratory
   compensation.
   - repeat CHEM7 [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # SLE c/b lupus nephritis - not particularly active per last rheum note
   from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9213**].
   - continue plaquenil.
   .
   # Rheumatic heart disease, s/p AVR, MVR - clinically euvolemic on exam.
   - continue heparin
   - TEE as above
   .
   # HTN - hold coreg, valsartan and lisinopril given hypotension and mild
   ARF.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   # Sepsis
 Staph aureus in [**4-9**] blood cx bottles from ED [**6-7**]. MRI
   consistent with embolic shower.  LP by IR showed WBC of 345.  This
   likely due to septic emboli and likely embolic infarcts explains
   seizures.
   - check TEE given fever, and high likelihood of endocarditis given
   embolic shower on MRI.
   - Continue Vanc, Amp, CTX, add gent for synergy. D/C acv as low
   likelihood of HSV and poor creatinine clearance
   -  f/u blood cx and sensitivities (MRSA swab from nose positive so
   higher likelihood it will be MRSA)
   - fluids and pressors to maintain MAP>65
   - F/U CSF cultures
   - contact cardiac surgery if not done yet
   # Seizures
 likely explained by septic emboli. LP by IR with elevated
   WBC.
   - appreciate neuro recs.
   - dilantin loaded here and will have level this AM
   - Continue empiric listeria coverage pending culture data.
   - f/u CSF cx.
   - Goal SBP 100-160
   # Hypotension
 Etiology secondary to sepsis. BPs trending down to high
   90s after 4-5L IVF in ED.  CVL was placed and aggressive fluid
   resuscitation was intiated however she required levophed to maintain
   SBP 100-160 per neuro recs.  .
   - CVL and A-line in place.
   - continue pressor support as needed
   - continue broad spectrum abx.
   # Respiratory
 Oxygenating well. Will decrease FiO2. Over-breathing
   vent
   - Daily wake ups and RSBI if appropriate.
   # ARF: Baseline cr of 1.2-1.7 and currently up slightly to 2.1.
   - Continue aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - monitor UOP and Cr
   - D/C ACV
   - F/U Renal recs
   .
   # Anemia - baseline low 32-33, but trending down to 25.5 this AM in
   setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation.  [**Month (only) 60**] be concern for
   hemolysis, but no schistocytes on smear and Haptoglobin <20.
   - cycle HCT Q8H
   - guaic stools.
   .
   # metabolic acidosis - likely [**2-7**] lactate and infectious etiology,
   lactate trending down with IVF, with appropriate respiratory
   compensation.
   - repeat CHEM7 [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # SLE c/b lupus nephritis - not particularly active per last rheum note
   from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9213**].
   - continue plaquenil.

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of SLE and lupus nephritis, who presented with a febrile seizure and was found to have multiple cortical infarcts on MRI, consistent with embolic shower. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, endocarditis, and septic emboli. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, with a history of hypotension, anemia, metabolic acidosis, and acute kidney injury.

The patient has received broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, ampicillin, and ceftriaxone, and is being treated for suspected MRSA endocarditis. She has also been given anticonvulsants for seizure prophylaxis.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, as well as acute kidney injury and metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient's embolic shower on MRI and the presence of septic emboli suggest a high likelihood of endocarditis, which can lead to serious complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and embolic events.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to worsen if not adequately treated, leading to multi-organ failure, shock, and death.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is likely to worsen if not treated promptly, leading to chronic kidney disease, electrolyte imbalances, and acidosis.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely to worsen if not treated promptly, leading to acidosis, electrolyte imbalances, and organ dysfunction.
5. Hemolysis: The patient's anemia and decreased haptoglobin levels suggest the possibility of hemolysis, which can lead to acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and acidosis.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen if not treated promptly, leading to respiratory arrest, hypoxia, and death.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's rheumatic heart disease and history of AVR and MVR surgery increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and embolic events.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple organ dysfunction, close monitoring and prompt treatment are essential to prevent further complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of SLE and lupus nephritis, who presented with a febrile seizure and was found to have multiple cortical infarcts on MRI, concerning for emboli. She has been treated with antibiotics, and a lumbar puncture (LP) showed elevated WBC count. She has also been diagnosed with sepsis, endocarditis, and acute kidney injury (AKI). She is receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation and has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her vital signs are stable, but she is still at risk for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has a high likelihood of endocarditis given the embolic shower on MRI, and a TEE is planned to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further septic episodes given the elevated WBC count in her CSF and the presence of septic emboli.
3. AKI: The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.2-1.7, and it has increased to 2.1, indicating AKI. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is being continued to try to improve renal function.
4. Hemolysis: The patient's Hct is trending down, and there is concern for hemolysis, but no schistocytes have been seen on smear. Haptoglobin is <20, which is consistent with hemolysis.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactate and infectious etiology. Lactate is trending down with IVF, but repeat CHEM7 and ABG are planned to monitor progress.
6. SLE Flare: The patient has a history of SLE and lupus nephritis, and there is concern for a flare given the elevated WBC count and the presence of septic emboli.
7. Heart Failure: The patient has rheumatic heart disease, and there is concern for heart failure given the embolic shower on MRI and the presence of septic emboli.

These complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Hypotension - relative hypotension after getting propofol in ED, now
   with BPs trending down to high 90s after 4-5L IVF.  most likely
   represents septic physiology, though both propofol and dilantin can
   also cause hypotension.
   - continue IVF resuscitation (lactate responded nicely to IVF).

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis, who presented with a febrile seizure and was found to have multiple cortical infarcts on MRI, consistent with an embolic shower. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, endocarditis, and seizures, and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other supportive care.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is trending down to the high 90s, and she is receiving IV fluids and vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure.
* Neurological: The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8, and is showing minimal arousal to sternal rub. She has a bilateral pupils, withdraws to pain minimally, and has dolls' eyes intact.
* Hematological: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and she has a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL.
* Renal: The patient has a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, and is receiving IV fluids and diuretics to manage her fluid status.
* Metabolic: The patient has a metabolic acidosis, with a lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock
* Endocarditis and cardiac complications
* Seizures and status epilepticus
* Respiratory failure and ventilator-associated pneumonia
* Renal failure and acute kidney injury
* Metabolic acidosis and lactic acidosis
* Hypotension and shock
* Coagulopathy and bleeding

Given the patient's complex medical condition and the potential for complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her care in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   57F with h/o SLE c/b nephritis presenting with febrile seizure.
   # Sepsis
 Staph aureus in blood cx bottles from ED. MRI consistent
   with embolic shower.  LP by IR showed WBC of 345.  This likely due to
   septic emboli and likely with embolic infarcts explains seizures.
   - check TEE given fever, and high likelihood of endocarditis given
   embolic shower on MRI.
   - Continue Vanc, Amp
   -  f/u blood cx and sensitivities
   - fluids and pressors to maintain MAP>65
   .
   # Seizures
 likely explained by septic emboli. LP by IR with elevated
   WBC.
   - appreciate neuro recs.
   - dilantin loaded hear and will have level this AM
   - continue acyclovir.
   - Continue empiric listeria coverage pending culture data.
   - f/u CSF cx.
   .
   # Hypotension
 Etiology secondary to sepsis. BPs trending down to high
   90s after 4-5L IVF in ED.  CVL was placed and aggressive fluid
   resuscitation was intiated.  .
   - CVL and A-line in place.
   - continue IVF resuscitation (lactate responded nicely to IVF).
   - continue broad spectrum abx.
   .
   # Respiratory
 intubated for airway protection during post-ictal
   state.
   - Daily wake ups and RSBI if appropriate.
   .
   # ARF: Baseline cr of 1.2-1.7 and currently up slightly to 2.1.
   - Continue aggressive fluid resuscitation
   - monitor UOP and Cr
   .
   # Anemia - baseline low 32-33, but trending down to 25.5 this AM in
   setting of aggressive fluid resuscitation.  [**Month (only) 60**] be concern for
   hemolysis, but no schistocytes on smear and Haptoglobin <20.
   - cycle HCT in AM.
   - guaic stools.
   .
   # metabolic acidosis - likely [**2-7**] lactate and infectious etiology,
   lactate trending down with IVF, with appropriate respiratory
   compensation.
   - repeat CHEM7 in AM.
   - repeat ABG in AM.
   .
   # SLE c/b lupus nephritis - not particularly active per last rheum note
   from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9213**].
   - continue plaquenil.
   .
   # Rheumatic heart disease, s/p AVR, MVR - clinically euvolemic on exam.
   - continue heparin
   - TEE as above
   .
   # HTN - hold coreg, valsartan and lisinopril given hypotension and mild
   ARF.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of SLE and lupus nephritis, presenting with a febrile seizure and subsequent MRI findings consistent with embolic shower. The patient has developed multiple cortical infarcts in the brain, likely due to septic emboli.

The patient's current condition is critical, with a diagnosis of sepsis, endocarditis, and possible hemolysis. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a stable blood pressure and heart rate. However, the patient's hematocrit is decreasing, and the patient is receiving blood products to support hemostasis.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and creatinine. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time.

The patient's medications include vancomycin, ampicillin, and acyclovir, with plans to continue these medications pending culture data. The patient is also receiving heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal coverage pending culture data.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation closely.
3. Continue mechanical ventilation and adjust settings as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's hematocrit and blood products closely.
5. Continue heparin and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
6. Consider TEE to evaluate for endocarditis.
7. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management accordingly.
8. Consider consultation with rheumatology and cardiology services.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury or respiratory failure.
2. Endocarditis-related complications, such as valve damage or embolic events.
3. Hemolysis-related complications, such as anemia or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
4. Respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia.
5. Renal failure or acute kidney injury.
6. Cardiovascular complications, such as hypotension or arrhythmias.

Based on the patient's current condition and plan of care, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or manage potential complications."

   with embolic shower.  Currently not candidate for ct surgery but
   possibly after 6 weeks abx.
   - Continue vanc, gent; monitor levels. D/c ampicillin; also d/c ctx as
   no gram negs
   - Consider add rifampin in a few days
   - F/u blood cx and sensitivities (MRSA swab from nose positive so
   higher likelihood it will be MRSA).
   - F/u CSF cultures
   - Daily EKG
   - Appreciate CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Appreciate ID input; f/u recs
   - Ask outpt rheumatology whether ok to cont Plaquenil in setting of
   high-grade infection
   # Septic Shock: Pressor requirement decreasing from 0.08->0.03 over the
   day yesterday. BPs stable.
   - Goal SBP 100-160 per neuro recs
   - Cte to wean off levophed as able
   # Seizures: likely explained by septic emboli. LP by IR with elevated
   WBC.
   - Appreciate neuro input; f/u recs
   - Continue Dilantin; follow levels and adjust dose as indicated
   - F/u CSF cx; abx as above
   - Goal SBP 100-160

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis, currently admitted to the ICU with septic shock, bacterial endocarditis, and possible embolic stroke. The patient has a bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis with a 2-cm long adjacent vegetation, resulting in mild paravalvular leak and 1+ mitral regurgitation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 128/74 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, mild anemia, and mild metabolic acidosis. The patient's renal function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show a bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis with a 2-cm long adjacent vegetation, mild paravalvular leak, and 1+ mitral regurgitation. The patient also has borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and no pericardial effusion.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Bacterial endocarditis: The patient has a confirmed vegetation on her prosthetic mitral valve, which is a high-risk complication of endocarditis.
2. Septic shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
3. Possible embolic stroke: The patient has a high risk of embolic stroke due to her endocarditis and may require anticoagulation therapy.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which is a high-risk condition that requires close monitoring.
5. Renal failure: The patient has compromised renal function, which may require dialysis.
6. Anemia: The patient has mild anemia, which may require blood transfusions.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has mild metabolic acidosis, which may require treatment with bicarbonate or other interventions.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving antibiotics for her bacterial endocarditis, including gentamicin and vancomycin.
2. Mechanical ventilation: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function.
3. Vasopressors: The patient is receiving vasopressors to support her blood pressure.
4. Dialysis: The patient may require dialysis to support her renal function.
5. Blood transfusions: The patient may require blood transfusions to support her anemia.
6. Anticoagulation therapy: The patient may require anticoagulation therapy to prevent embolic stroke.

The patient's prognosis is guarded due to her multiple medical complications and high-risk conditions. Close monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to manage her condition and prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of SLE and lupus nephritis who presented with a febrile seizure and was found to have endocarditis with a vegetation on her prosthetic mitral valve. She has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely due to septic emboli, and is being treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, gentamicin, and ceftriaxone. She has also been diagnosed with acute renal failure and anemia, and is being treated with fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions. Her respiratory status is stable, but she is being monitored for potential respiratory complications. She has a history of seizures, which are being managed with anticonvulsants. She is also being treated for metabolic acidosis and is receiving nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued septic shock and organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock is likely to continue, and she may experience further organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, renal failure, and cardiac failure.
2. Endocarditis-related complications: The patient's endocarditis may lead to further complications, including embolic events, valvular insufficiency, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to further respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen, leading to further respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
6. Seizures: The patient's seizures may continue, and she may experience further neurological complications.
7. Infection: The patient's infection may spread to other parts of her body, leading to further complications and increased risk of mortality.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's endocarditis and septic shock may lead to further cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrest and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and anticonvulsants as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and organ function closely, and adjust treatment accordingly.
3. Continue fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Continue nutritional support and monitor the patient's nutritional status.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte imbalances and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust treatment accordingly.
8. Consider adding rifampin to the patient's antibiotic regimen in a few days, if cultures remain positive.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's blood cultures and adjust treatment accordingly.
10. Consider performing a repeat TEE to assess the patient's endocarditis and valvular function."

   Imaging: TEE:
   A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve
   prosthesis leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are
   seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. A bileaflet
   mitral valve prosthesis is present. The motion of the mitral valve
   prosthetic leaflets appears normal. A paravalvular mitral prosthesis
   leak is present. There is an approximately 2 cm x 0.4 cm mobile
   vegetation attached to the anterior aspect of the suture ring of the
   mitral valve (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A tricuspid valve
   annuloplasty ring is present. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus
   is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the
   body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal
   defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity size
   is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
   (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
   normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 40 cm from the
   incisors. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension in
   the setting of intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis with 2-cm long adjacent
   vegetation. Mild paravalvular leak and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
   2. Well-seated, normally functioning bioprosthetic aortic valve
   replacement. No aortic vegetation.
   3. Tricuspid annuloplasty ring is present. Mild tricuspid
   regurgitation. No tricuspid or pulmonic valve vegetations.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: TEE:
   A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve
   prosthesis leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are
   seen on the aortic valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. A bileaflet
   mitral valve prosthesis is present. The motion of the mitral valve
   prosthetic leaflets appears normal. A paravalvular mitral prosthesis
   leak is present. There is an approximately 2 cm x 0.4 cm mobile
   vegetation attached to the anterior aspect of the suture ring of the
   mitral valve (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. A tricuspid valve
   annuloplasty ring is present. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus
   is seen in the body of the left atrium/left atrial appendage or the
   body of the right atrium/right atrial appendage. No atrial septal
   defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. The left ventricular cavity size
   is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
   (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are
   normal in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque to 40 cm from the
   incisors. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension in
   the setting of intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis with 2-cm long adjacent
   vegetation. Mild paravalvular leak and 1+ mitral regurgitation.
   2. Well-seated, normally functioning bioprosthetic aortic valve
   replacement. No aortic vegetation.
   3. Tricuspid annuloplasty ring is present. Mild tricuspid
   regurgitation. No tricuspid or pulmonic valve vegetations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female admitted to the ICU with sepsis, renal failure, chronic anemia, fever of unknown origin, seizure with status epilepticus, and metabolic acidosis. She has a bileaflet mitral valve prosthesis with a 2-cm long adjacent vegetation, mild paravalvular leak, and 1+ mitral regurgitation. The patient is also diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, chronic anemia, and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Bacterial endocarditis: The patient has a vegetation attached to the mitral valve prosthesis, which increases the risk of bacterial endocarditis.
2. Endocardial abscess: The vegetation on the mitral valve prosthesis can lead to the formation of an endocardial abscess, which can cause sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Embolic strokes: The patient has a high risk of embolic strokes due to the presence of a vegetation on the mitral valve prosthesis.
4. Hemorrhagic conversion: The patient has a risk of hemorrhagic conversion of embolic strokes, which can lead to significant bleeding and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which can worsen with the use of nephrotoxic medications and inadequate fluid management.
6. Seizure recurrence: The patient has a history of seizure with status epilepticus, and there is a risk of recurrence, which can be life-threatening.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which can worsen with inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
8. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which can worsen with inadequate management of electrolytes and fluids.
9. Infections: The patient has a high risk of developing infections, particularly sepsis, due to the presence of a vegetation on the mitral valve prosthesis and the use of invasive lines and devices.
10. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a high risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock, due to the presence of a vegetation on the mitral valve prosthesis and the use of vasopressors and inotropes.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her conditions to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   57F with h/o SLE c/b nephritis presenting with febrile seizure.
   # Endocarditis: TEE with confirmed veg on prosthetic MV and resultant
   MR. [**First Name (Titles) 9238**] [**Last Name (Titles) 9239**] in [**4-9**] blood cx bottles from ED [**6-7**]. MRI consistent
   with embolic shower.  Currently not candidate for ct surgery but
   possibly after 6 weeks abx.
   - Continue vanc, gent; monitor levels. D/c ampicillin; also d/c ctx as
   no gram negs
   - Add rifampin today
   - F/u blood cx and sensitivities (MRSA swab from nose positive so
   higher likelihood it will be MRSA).
   - F/u CSF cultures
   - Daily EKG showed prolonged PR today->cls cards for PR prolongation
   and ?temp ppm wire
   - Appreciate CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Appreciate ID input; Will check vanc peak and trough per their recs.
   # Septic Shock: Pressor requirement d/c
d yesterday. BPs stable.
   - Goal SBP 100-160 per neuro recs
   # Seizures: likely explained by septic emboli. LP by IR with elevated
   WBC.
   - Appreciate neuro input; f/u recs
   - Continue Dilantin; follow levels and adjust dose as indicated
   - F/u CSF cx; abx as above
   - Goal SBP 100-160
   # Respiratory: Over-breathing vent yesterday. Will try propofol with
   fentanyl bolus PRNinstead today
   - Will check ABG this am->adjust settings appropriately
   - Daily wake ups and RSBI if appropriate.
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need trach soon. Will cls thoracics in next few days.
   # Metabolic alkalosis: Unclear etiology for increased bicarb given net
   pos.
   - Check urine anion gap->likely secondary to fluid resusitation
   # ARF: Baseline cr of 1.2-1.7 and currently up slightly to 2.2. [**Month (only) 60**] be
   prerenal as pt mildly tachycardic and with large amt of insensible
   losses
   - Fluid bolus today, reassess in PM for goal 1-2L positive
   - Monitor vanc/gent levels
   - Monitor UOP, Cr, CVP
   - F/u Renal recs
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline low 32-33, trended down to 25 on [**6-8**] in setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation but stable around 25 since. Concern for
   hemolysis given haptoglobin <20, but no schistocytes on smear. Of note,
   question of hemolysis has come up in past for haptoglobin <20; may have
   shearing by mechanical valves although urine hemosiderin neg.
   - Cycle HCT daily
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   # SLE c/b lupus nephritis - Not particularly active per last rheum note
   from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9213**].
   - continued plaquenil->confirm with rheum that should still be on this
   given high-grade infection

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 57-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis, was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of septic shock, endocarditis, and respiratory failure. She has been receiving treatment with antibiotics, including vancomycin and gentamicin, and has been mechanically ventilated.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's blood pressure has been stable, and her central venous pressure (CVP) has decreased from 15 to 12 mmHg. Her urine output has increased from 100 mL to 1,545 mL, and her creatinine level has increased from 1.2-1.7 mg/dL to 2.2 mg/dL.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, with a decrease in her respiratory rate and an increase in her partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). Her blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) remains at 100%.

The patient's neurological status has also improved, with a decrease in her Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score from 8 to 11. Her pupils are reactive to light, and she is able to withdraw to pain in her left leg.

The patient's laboratory results show an increase in her white blood cell count (WBC) from 20.6 to 21.0 x 10^9/L, and a decrease in her platelet count (PLT) from 72 to 107 x 10^9/L. Her liver function tests (LFTs) show an increase in her aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level from 28 to 41 IU/L, and a decrease in her albumin level from 2.9 to 2.7 g/dL.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock may worsen if her antibiotic treatment is ineffective or if she develops multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's endocarditis may progress if her antibiotic treatment is ineffective or if she develops a complication such as heart failure or embolic events.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if her mechanical ventilation is ineffective or if she develops a complication such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status may worsen if she develops a complication such as sepsis-induced encephalopathy, cerebral edema, or stroke.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen if her creatinine level continues to increase or if she develops a complication such as acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she develops a complication such as hemolysis or bleeding.
7. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis may worsen if her bicarbonate level continues to increase or if she develops a complication such as hypokalemia or hypocalcemia.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, I recommend the following:

1. Continue antibiotic treatment with vancomycin and gentamicin, and monitor the patient's response to treatment.
2. Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor the patient's respiratory status.
3. Monitor the patient's neurological status and provide supportive care as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and provide supportive care as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and provide supportive care as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's metabolic alkalosis and provide supportive care as needed.
7. Consider the patient's potential for cardiac complications and provide supportive care as needed.

I recommend that the patient continue to receive close monitoring and supportive care in the ICU, and that she be referred to a cardiologist and a nephrologist for further evaluation and management of her condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - F/u Renal recs
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline low 32-33, trended down to 25 on [**6-8**] in setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation but stable around 25 since. Concern for
   hemolysis given haptoglobin <20, but no schistocytes on smear. Of note,
   question of hemolysis has come up in past for haptoglobin <20; may have
   shearing by mechanical valves although urine hemosiderin neg.
   - Cycle HCT Q8H

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of SLE and lupus nephritis who presented with a febrile seizure. She was found to have endocarditis with a confirmed vegetation on her prosthetic mitral valve and resultant mitral regurgitation. She was started on antibiotics and is currently receiving vancomycin and gentamicin. She is also being treated for septic shock, seizures, and metabolic alkalosis. Her respiratory status is stable, but she is at risk for over-breathing. She has anemia, which is being managed with packed red blood cells. She is also at risk for metabolic acidosis, which is being monitored. The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving tube feeds, and her nutritional status is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: The patient has a confirmed vegetation on her prosthetic mitral valve, which increases her risk of developing endocarditis-related complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and stroke.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock is being managed with antibiotics and vasopressors, but she is at risk for further deterioration if her condition is not properly managed.
3. Seizures: The patient's seizures are likely related to her septic emboli, and she is at risk for further seizures if her condition is not properly managed.
4. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient's metabolic alkalosis is unclear in etiology, and she is at risk for further complications if it is not properly managed.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is being managed with packed red blood cells, but she is at risk for further complications if her anemia is not properly managed.
6. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely related to her septic shock, and she is at risk for further complications if it is not properly managed.
7. SLE Flare: The patient's SLE is in remission, but she is at risk for a flare-up if her condition is not properly managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy for endocarditis and septic shock.
2. Monitor the patient's septic shock closely and adjust therapy as necessary.
3. Manage the patient's seizures with anticonvulsants and monitor her closely for further seizures.
4. Investigate the etiology of the patient's metabolic alkalosis and manage it accordingly.
5. Manage the patient's anemia with packed red blood cells and monitor her closely for further complications.
6. Monitor the patient's metabolic acidosis closely and adjust therapy as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's SLE closely and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent a flare-up."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   57F with h/o SLE c/b nephritis presenting with febrile seizure.
   # Endocarditis: TEE with confirmed veg on prosthetic MV and resultant
   MR. [**First Name (Titles) 9238**] [**Last Name (Titles) 9239**] in [**4-9**] blood cx bottles from ED [**6-7**]. MRI consistent
   with embolic shower.  Currently not candidate for ct surgery but
   possibly after 6 weeks abx.
   - Continue vanc, gent; monitor levels. D/c ampicillin; also d/c ctx as
   no gram negs
   - Consider add rifampin in a few days
   - F/u blood cx and sensitivities (MRSA swab from nose positive so
   higher likelihood it will be MRSA).
   - F/u CSF cultures
   - Daily EKG
   - Appreciate CT [**Doctor First Name 458**] recs
   - Appreciate ID input; f/u recs
   - Ask outpt rheumatology whether ok to cont Plaquenil in setting of
   high-grade infection
   # Septic Shock: Pressor requirement decreasing from 0.08->0.03 over the
   day yesterday. BPs stable.
   - Goal SBP 100-160 per neuro recs
   - Cte to wean off levophed as able
   # Seizures: likely explained by septic emboli. LP by IR with elevated
   WBC.
   - Appreciate neuro input; f/u recs
   - Continue Dilantin; follow levels and adjust dose as indicated
   - F/u CSF cx; abx as above
   - Goal SBP 100-160
   # Respiratory: Over-breathing vent yesterday
   - Will check ABG this am->adjust settings appropriately
   - Daily wake ups and RSBI if appropriate.
   # ARF: Baseline cr of 1.2-1.7 and currently up slightly to 2.2. [**Month (only) 60**] be
   prerenal as pt mildly tachycardic and with large amt of insensible
   losses
   - Fluid bolus today, reassess in PM for goal 1-2L positive
   - Monitor vanc/gent levels
   - Monitor UOP, Cr, CVP
   - F/u Renal recs
   .
   # Anemia: Baseline low 32-33, trended down to 25 on [**6-8**] in setting of
   aggressive fluid resuscitation but stable around 25 since. Concern for
   hemolysis given haptoglobin <20, but no schistocytes on smear. Of note,
   question of hemolysis has come up in past for haptoglobin <20; may have
   shearing by mechanical valves although urine hemosiderin neg.
   - Cycle HCT Q8H
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Likely [**2-7**] lactate and infectious etiology; with
   appropriate respiratory compensation. Lactate trended with IVF.
   - Repeat chem7 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Follow lactate
   .
   # SLE c/b lupus nephritis - Not particularly active per last rheum note
   from Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9213**].
   - continued plaquenil->confirm with rheum that should still be on this
   given high-grade infection

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis who presented with a febrile seizure. She was diagnosed with endocarditis, specifically on a prosthetic mitral valve, and is being treated with vancomycin and gentamicin. The patient is also experiencing septic shock, seizures, and acute respiratory failure. She has anemia, metabolic acidosis, and is at risk for hemolysis due to mechanical valves. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and various medications and treatments are being adjusted to address these complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's pressor requirement is decreasing, but she is still at risk for further deterioration. Close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid status is essential to prevent further complications.
2. Seizures: The patient's seizures are likely related to septic emboli, and further evaluation with LP and CSF cultures is necessary to guide treatment.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and close monitoring of ABG and RSBI is necessary to adjust ventilator settings and prevent further complications.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.2-1.7, and her current creatinine is 2.2. Close monitoring of UOP, Cr, and CVP is necessary to prevent further AKI and adjust fluid management.
5. Hemolysis: The patient is at risk for hemolysis due to mechanical valves, and close monitoring of haptoglobin and urine hemosiderin is necessary to detect any signs of hemolysis.
6. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely related to lactate and infectious etiology, and close monitoring of lactate and chem7 is necessary to adjust treatment.
7. SLE Flare: The patient's SLE is not particularly active, but close monitoring of disease activity and adjusting treatment as necessary is essential to prevent flares.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   spontaneously converted back to sinus afterward.  Pacer pads were
   placed.   EP consulted to place temp pacing wire this AM, but family
   was consulted and decided against this invasive procedure
   - family mtg to discuss goals of care.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of SLE and lupus nephritis, currently admitted to the ICU for sepsis, respiratory failure, and chronic renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.5°F, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 145/76 mmHg. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's EKG shows PR prolongation, and an episode of asystolic pause was documented, which spontaneously converted to sinus rhythm. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's diagnosis includes sepsis without organ dysfunction, renal failure, chronic anemia, fever of unknown origin, seizure with status epilepticus, and acidosis. The patient's goals of care are being discussed with the family, and the patient has a DNR status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver failure, or cardiovascular collapse.
2. Respiratory failure, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Chronic kidney disease, which can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) if not managed properly.
4. Anemia, which can exacerbate the patient's chronic kidney disease and increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
5. Metabolic acidosis, which can worsen the patient's respiratory and cardiac function.
6. Seizure recurrence, which can lead to status epilepticus and increased morbidity and mortality.
7. Endocarditis, which can lead to further complications, such as embolic events, if not managed properly.

The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and management of electrolyte and fluid disorders. The patient's family is being consulted regarding goals of care, and the patient's DNR status is being respected."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-inch tall individual who has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic anemia, and is currently experiencing sepsis without organ dysfunction.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.5°F (38.6°C)
* Heart rate: 87 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 145/76 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 98%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 21.0 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 107 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 137 mg/dL
* Sodium: 142 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.3 mmol/L
* Chloride: 117 mmol/L
* Carbon dioxide: 25.3 mmol/L
* Glucose: 109 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* LDH: 423 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.4 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.3 mg/dL

The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) shows first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, and the patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation with a 15-second asystolic pause in the morning. The patient has been started on rifampin and has developed a fever.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 590 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.13, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 38 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 69 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination is notable for the absence of peripheral pulses, skin changes, and neurological deficits.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Respiratory failure
* Acute kidney injury
* Metabolic acidosis
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Seizures
* Pneumonia
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a [age] year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever, with a temperature of 101.5°F (38.6°C). The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, chronic anemia, and seizure disorder. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with a heart rate of 87 bpm and a blood pressure of 145/76 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's neurological status is altered, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, and is requiring mechanical ventilation.

The patient has developed several complications, including:

1. Fever: The patient's temperature has been elevated for the past 24 hours, with a maximum temperature of 101.5°F (38.6°C).
2. EKG changes: The patient's EKG has shown PR prolongation, and the patient has developed atrial fibrillation with a 15-second asystolic pause.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is requiring mechanical ventilation, with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 98%.
4. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and is currently receiving hemodialysis.
5. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL.
6. Seizure disorder: The patient has a history of seizure disorder, and has developed status epilepticus.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has developed metabolic acidosis, with a serum bicarbonate level of 17 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's EKG changes and atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen, leading to uremia and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
5. Seizure disorder: The patient's seizure disorder may worsen, leading to increased seizure frequency and severity.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen, leading to further complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Sepsis without organ dysfunction
* Renal failure, chronic
* Anemia, chronic
* Fever, unknown origin
* Seizure, with status epilepticus
* Acidosis, metabolic
* Respiratory failure, acute

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue vanc and gent, monitor levels
* D/c ampicillin, also d/c ctx as no gram negs
* Add rifampin today
* F/u blood cx and sensitivities
* F/u CSF cultures
* Daily EKG showing prolonged PR today, cls cards for PR prolongation and?temp ppm wire
* Appreciate CT recs
* Appreciate ID input, will check vanc peak and trough per their recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 57-year-old female with MRSA endocarditis involving mechanical valves and bioprosthesis. She has had continued evolution of complications, including fevers, worsening conduction delay with PR prolongation, and intermittent asystole. Despite medical management with vancomycin and rifampin, the infection has not responded, and the patient has significant impairment in conduction system integrity. The patient has been deemed a DNR (do not resuscitate) and has been advised against surgical intervention.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Prolongation of PR interval and intermittent asystole may lead to cardiac arrest or sudden death.
	* Endocarditis may cause valve damage, leading to heart failure or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Respiratory failure may worsen due to the patient's chronic respiratory disease and the need for mechanical ventilation.
	* Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to the patient's mental status.
3. Renal complications:
	* Chronic kidney disease may worsen due to the patient's underlying condition and the need for dialysis.
	* Acute kidney injury may occur due to sepsis or other complications.
4. Neurological complications:
	* Seizures and status epilepticus may occur due to the patient's underlying condition and the need for anticonvulsant therapy.
	* Cerebral edema may develop due to the patient's underlying condition and the need for sedation and analgesia.
5. Metabolic complications:
	* Electrolyte and fluid disorders may worsen due to the patient's underlying condition and the need for intravenous fluids and electrolyte replacement.
	* Metabolic acidosis may develop due to the patient's underlying condition and the need for acid-base management.
6. Infectious complications:
	* MRSA endocarditis may spread to other parts of the body, leading to sepsis and organ failure.
	* Other infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, may develop due to the patient's compromised immune system."
