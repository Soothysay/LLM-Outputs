   Assessment and Plan
   36 year-old gentleman with history of smoking and hemoptysis who was
   recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass who comes with hemoptysis
   and a pulmonary embolus for anticoagulation.
   .
   #. Pulmonary embolus - Small provoked PE in the left upper lobe
   segmental artery. It is unclear how much the mass effect compressing
   the L pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins is contributing to low
   flow and stasis, versus hypercoagulable state secondary to malignancy.
   Patient was initially anticoagulated with heparin.  LENIs showed no
   evidence of DVT.
   - discuss with Radiology regarding if clot may be [**2-10**] tumor
   compression; if so, consider d/c of heparin gtt
   - d/c heparin gtt for now pending final decision if repeat biopsy is to
   be pursued
   .
   # hemoptysis
 Appears to be resolving.  Most likely source is mass
   given proximity with airway.  No clear evidence of fistula.  Currently
   breathing comfortably.

   #. Mediastinal mass - Patient has a mediastinal mass of ~14 cm X ~5
   cm.  He is a smoker with 22 pack-year.  By location differential
   diagnosis includes lymphoma, thymoma, angiomatous tumor.  He has
   history of reflux so esophageal cancer is in the differential, but not
   likely.  Germ cell tumor are very common in this age group.  Primary
   lung cancer is very unlikely.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of smoking and hemoptysis who was recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass and pulmonary embolus. The patient is currently in the ICU for management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 111/67 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with bibasal crackles in the lungs and good air movement.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-appearing male with no signs of jaundice, no thyromegaly, and no carotid bruits. The patient's neck examination shows left lymphadenopathy of approximately 3 cm, which is mobile. The patient's lung examination shows bibasal crackles, with the left lung sounds slightly quieter.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 301 K/uL. The patient's coagulation studies show a prothrombin time of 13.8 seconds, partial thromboplastin time of 35.5 seconds, and international normalized ratio of 1.2.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Pulmonary embolus: The patient has a small provoked pulmonary embolism in the left upper lobe segmental artery. The patient is currently anticoagulated with heparin, and the plan is to discuss with radiology regarding the possibility of tumor compression and consider discontinuing heparin.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient's hemoptysis appears to be resolving, and the most likely source is the mediastinal mass given its proximity to the airway. The patient is being actively monitored, and bronchoscopy is planned in the morning.
3. Mediastinal mass: The patient has a mediastinal mass measuring approximately 14 cm x 5 cm. The patient is a smoker with a 22-pack-year history, and the differential diagnosis includes lymphoma, thymoma, angiomatous tumor, and germ cell tumor. The patient is being followed up with bronchoscopy and biopsy in the morning, and the plan is to discuss with oncology regarding further workup and disposition from the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk of developing further pulmonary emboli, especially if the tumor compression is contributing to low flow and stasis.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient's hemoptysis may worsen if the mediastinal mass is not effectively treated.
3. Mediastinal mass: The patient's mediastinal mass may continue to compress surrounding structures, including the trachea and major vessels, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular compromise.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, especially if the mediastinal mass is not effectively treated.
5. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of bleeding, especially if the pulmonary embolism is not effectively treated.

In summary, the patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of smoking and hemoptysis who was recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass and pulmonary embolism. The patient is currently in the ICU for management, and potential medical complications include pulmonary embolism, hemoptysis, mediastinal mass, infection, and bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   36 year-old gentleman with history of smoking and hemoptysis who was
   recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass who comes with hemoptysis
   and a pulmonary embolus for anticoagulation.
   .
   #. Pulmonary embolus - Small provoked PE in the left upper lobe
   segmental artery. It is unclear how much the mass effect compressing
   the L pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins is contributing to low
   flow and stasis, versus hypercoagulable state secondary to malignancy.
   Patient was initially anticoagulated with heparin.  LENIs showed no
   evidence of DVT.
   - discuss with Radiology regarding if clot may be [**2-10**] tumor
   compression; if so, consider d/c of heparin gtt
   - d/c heparin gtt for now pending final decision if repeat biopsy is to
   be pursued

 Appears to be resolving.  Most likely source is mass
   given proximity with airway.  No clear evidence of fistula.  Currently
   breathing comfortably.

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of smoking and hemoptysis who was recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass. He was admitted to the ICU with a pulmonary embolus and was initially anticoagulated with heparin. The patient's condition appears to be stable, with no evidence of DVT on LENIs. The mediastinal mass is causing compression of the left pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins, which may be contributing to low flow and stasis. The patient's hemoptysis appears to be resolving, and he is breathing comfortably. The patient's labs are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated LDH and alkaline phosphatase.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's pulmonary embolism may worsen if the clot is not adequately treated. The patient's anticoagulation regimen should be continued, and further discussion with radiology is needed regarding the possibility of tumor compression of the clot.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient's hemoptysis may recur if the mediastinal mass is not adequately treated. The patient's airway should be monitored closely, and bronchoscopy may be necessary to rule out a fistula.
3. Mediastinal Mass: The patient's mediastinal mass may continue to compress the surrounding structures, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular compromise. Further evaluation and treatment of the mass are necessary to determine the best course of action.
4. Malignancy: The patient's mediastinal mass is likely malignant, and further evaluation and treatment are necessary to determine the best course of action.
5. DVT: The patient's DVT prophylaxis should be continued to prevent further clot formation.
6. Stress Ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to his critical illness and should be monitored closely for signs of bleeding.
7. VAP: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to his prolonged intubation and should be monitored closely for signs of infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin to treat the pulmonary embolism.
2. Monitor the patient's airway closely and consider bronchoscopy to rule out a fistula.
3. Evaluate the mediastinal mass further to determine the best course of action for treatment.
4. Continue DVT prophylaxis to prevent further clot formation.
5. Monitor the patient closely for signs of bleeding and stress ulcer.
6. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent bleeding.
7. Monitor the patient closely for signs of infection and consider VAP prophylaxis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 453**] [**Known lastname 14231**] is a very nice 36 year-old gentleman with history
   of smoking and hemoptysis who was recently diagnosed with a mediastinal
   mass who comes with hemoptysis and a pulmonary embolus for
   anticoagulation.
   .
   #. Pulmonary embolus - Small provoked PE in the left upper lobe
   segmental artery. It is unclear how much the mass effect compressing
   the L pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins is contributing to low
   flow and stasis, versus hypercoagulable state secondary to malignancy.
   Patient has a mass and hemoptysis with normal coagulation profile, that
   makes managing challenging. IP was consulted and decided in
   anticoagulate with heparin and monitor in ICU. F/u LENIs to assess clot
   burden; if severe may not be able to stop anticoagulation for
   procedures.
   - F/u LENIs --> no dvt
   - Gentle heparin gtt --> consider d/c
   - Sitch to lovenox given malignancy once management of mass is decided
   (i.e. bronch, versus biopsy) until remision of cancer
   - Guaiac stools
   - HCT q8 hrs
   - Stop heparin gtt 5 hours prior to bronchoscopy
   .
   #. Hemoptysis - Patient with pulmonary embolus (small) and a very large
   mediastinal mass. He has been having hemoptysis for ~1 month and now is
   s/p CT-guided biopsy. The most likely source in the mass given its
   proximity with the airway. NO clear evidence of fistula are seen. He is
   breathing comfortably. Now he may be at higher risk of bleeding given
   heparin gtt.
   - Monitor in ICU
   - Intubate for ariway protection if bleeding
   - Bronchoscopy in AM vs f/u OSH bx
   - If major bleeding consider embolization
   - 2 Large IVs
   - T&S with 2 units crossmatched
   - Stop heparin gtt 5 hours prior to bronchoscopy
   .
   #. Mediastinal mass - Patient has a mediastinal mass of ~14 cm X ~5 cm.
   He is a smoker with 22 pack-year. By location differential diagnosis
   includes lymphoma, thymoma, angiomatous tumor. He has history of reflux
   so esophageal cancer is in the differential, but not likely. Germ cell
   tumor are very common in this age group. Primary lung cancer is very
   unlikely.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of smoking and hemoptysis, recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass and a pulmonary embolus. He is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin and is being monitored in the ICU. The patient has a mass and hemoptysis with a normal coagulation profile, making management challenging. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and plans are in place for bronchoscopy and biopsy to further evaluate the mediastinal mass.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of bleeding due to the heparin infusion and the presence of a mediastinal mass. If bleeding occurs, the patient may require intubation for airway protection and consideration of embolization.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a small pulmonary embolus in the left upper lobe segmental artery, which may worsen if not properly managed.
3. Malignancy: The patient has a mediastinal mass that is likely malignant, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored due to the presence of a mediastinal mass and pulmonary embolus.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection due to the presence of a mediastinal mass and the use of invasive devices.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 301 K/uL, which may be a concern due to the use of anticoagulation therapy.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile is normal, but the use of anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of bleeding.
8. Nutritional Deficits: The patient is NPO and has a history of smoking, which may lead to nutritional deficits.
9. Pain Management: The patient is receiving pain management with Tylenol, but may require further evaluation and treatment for pain management.
10. Psychosocial Concerns: The patient has a family member who is being informed of his condition and treatment plan, but may require further psychosocial support."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of smoking and hemoptysis, recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass. He was admitted with a pulmonary embolism (PE) and underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy. The patient has been receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin, which was temporarily stopped during the procedure. The patient's condition has been stable, with no evidence of bleeding. He has a large mediastinal mass, approximately 14 cm x 5 cm, which is causing compression of the left pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins, leading to low flow and stasis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of bleeding due to the heparin therapy, especially given the recent bronchoscopy procedure. Close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect any signs of bleeding.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's PE is likely to be secondary to stasis caused by the mediastinal mass, and he may be at risk of further embolization. Close monitoring of his pulmonary function and imaging studies is necessary to detect any signs of worsening embolism.
3. Malignancy: The patient's mediastinal mass is likely to be malignant, and further staging and treatment are necessary to determine the best course of action.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he may be at risk of developing respiratory failure due to the compression of his lungs by the mediastinal mass.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his compromised immune system and the presence of a foreign body (bronchoscopy tube).
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but he may be at risk of developing cardiac complications due to the compression of his heart by the mediastinal mass.

Recommendations:

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin, but monitor the patient's bleeding risk closely.
2. Perform further imaging studies to determine the extent of the mediastinal mass and any potential spread to other areas of the body.
3. Consider further staging and treatment for the patient's malignant mediastinal mass.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory function closely and consider intubation if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's infection risk and consider prophylactic antibiotics if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac function closely and consider cardiology consultation if necessary."

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with a lung mass and a history of pulmonary embolism (PE). They underwent a rigid bronchoscopy procedure with heparin stopped temporarily due to the PE being likely secondary to stasis from compression of the mass. Heparin was restarted post-procedure per interventional procedure (IP) recommendations. The patient is currently on 6L NC oxygen and experiencing throat pain. The oncology team has recommended HIV testing, uric acid level, MRI brain, and CT abd/pelvis for staging. The patient's lab results show abnormalities in hemoglobin, platelet count, and liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's platelet count is 367 K/uL, which is low, and they received heparin post-procedure, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
2. Infection: The patient has a lung mass and is on mechanical ventilation, making them susceptible to respiratory infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of PE and is at risk for developing DVT, particularly with the use of heparin.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%, but they are still on 6L NC oxygen, which may indicate ongoing respiratory distress.
5. Sepsis: The patient's lab results show abnormalities in liver function tests, which may indicate infection or inflammation, potentially leading to sepsis.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological exam is incomplete, and they are at risk for neurological complications due to the lung mass and potential respiratory failure.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's nutrition plan is not specified, and they may be at risk for malnutrition due to their lung disease and potential respiratory failure.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's condition to prevent or minimize their occurrence."

   Mr. [**Known firstname 453**] [**Known lastname 14231**] is a very nice 36 year-old gentleman with history
   of smoking and hemoptysis who was recently diagnosed with a mediastinal
   mass who comes with hemoptysis and a pulmonary embolus for
   anticoagulation.
   .
   #. Pulmonary embolus - Small provoked PE in the left upper lobe
   segmental artery. It is unclear how much the mass effect compressing
   the L pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins is contributing to low
   flow and stasis, versus hypercoagulable state secondary to malignancy.
   Now s/p  bronch and per IP ok to restart heparin.
   - restarted heparin post-bronch
   .
   #. Hemoptysis - Patient with pulmonary embolus (small) and a very large
   mediastinal mass. He has been having hemoptysis for ~1 month and now is
   s/p CT-guided biopsy. The most likely source in the mass given its
   proximity with the airway. NO clear evidence of fistula are seen. He is
   breathing comfortably. Now he may be at higher risk of bleeding given
   heparin gtt.  Stable over the course of his [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] stay while on
   heparin.  Now post bronch and stable
   - Monitor in ICU
   - Intubate for ariway protection if bleeding
   - If major bleeding consider embolization
   - 2 Large IVs
   - T&S with 2 units crossmatched
   .
   #. Mediastinal mass - Patient has a mediastinal mass of ~14 cm X ~5 cm.
   He is a smoker with 22 pack-year. By location differential diagnosis
   includes lymphoma, thymoma, angiomatous tumor. He has history of reflux
   so esophageal cancer is in the differential, but not likely. Germ cell
   tumor are very common in this age group. Primary lung cancer is very
   unlikely.
   - TSH
   - Serum calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone
   - Alpha fetoprotein
   - beta human chorionic gonadotropin
   - Consider Fractionated 24-hour urinary metanephrines and
   catecholamines
   - f/u biopsy results
   - Follow up final path report from [**Location (un) 755**]
   - Onc consult once pathology results back
   - call out to oncology service in AM
   .
   #. Smoking - Patient stopped smoking 3 weeks ago.
   .
   #. GERD - Continue tums for now; one dose of protonix IV post bronch.
   .
   #. FEN - ADAT.
   .
   #. Access - PIVs.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of smoking and hemoptysis who was recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass and a small provoked pulmonary embolism (PE) in the left upper lobe segmental artery. The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and is currently being monitored in the ICU. The patient is receiving heparin for anticoagulation and is being treated for hemoptysis, which is likely related to the mediastinal mass.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 118/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and is being monitored for potential complications.

The patient has a history of smoking and is at risk for respiratory and cardiovascular complications. The mediastinal mass is likely to be the source of the patient's symptoms, and further testing is needed to determine the exact diagnosis and staging of the cancer.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to the heparin therapy and the presence of a mediastinal mass.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient may develop respiratory failure due to the mediastinal mass compressing the airway or the pulmonary embolism.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient may develop cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, due to the mediastinal mass compressing the cardiac structures.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the presence of a foreign body (the mediastinal mass) and the use of invasive procedures (the bronchoscopy).
5. Malignant progression: The patient's cancer may progress and spread to other parts of the body, leading to further complications and poor outcomes.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient may develop nutritional deficiencies due to the presence of a mediastinal mass and the use of invasive procedures.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient may develop gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation, due to the presence of a mediastinal mass and the use of anticoagulant therapy.

Based on this information, I recommend that the patient be closely monitored in the ICU for any signs of bleeding, respiratory failure, cardiac complications, or infection. The patient's cancer should be further staged and treated with a multidisciplinary approach involving oncologists, pulmonologists, and other specialists."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   A/P per last night transfer note: not much change overnight except some
   weaning of nasal canula O2.
   Mr. [**Known firstname 453**] [**Known lastname 14231**] is a very nice 36 year-old gentleman with history
   of smoking and hemoptysis who was recently diagnosed with a mediastinal
   mass who comes with hemoptysis and a pulmonary embolus for
   anticoagulation.
   .
   #. Pulmonary embolus - Small provoked PE in the left upper lobe
   segmental artery. It is unclear how much the mass effect compressing
   the L pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins is contributing to low
   flow and stasis, versus hypercoagulable state secondary to malignancy.
   Now s/p  bronch and per IP ok to restart heparin.
   - restarted heparin post-bronch
   .
   #. Hemoptysis - Patient with pulmonary embolus (small) and a very large
   mediastinal mass. He has been having hemoptysis for ~1 month and now is
   s/p CT-guided biopsy. The most likely source in the mass given its
   proximity with the airway. NO clear evidence of fistula are seen. He is
   breathing comfortably. Now he may be at higher risk of bleeding given
   heparin gtt.  Stable over the course of his [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] stay while on
   heparin.  Now post bronch and stable
   - Monitor in ICU
   - Intubate for ariway protection if bleeding
   - If major bleeding consider embolization
   - 2 Large IVs
   - T&S with 2 units crossmatched
   .
   #. Mediastinal mass - Patient has a mediastinal mass of ~14 cm X ~5 cm.
   He is a smoker with 22 pack-year. By location differential diagnosis
   includes lymphoma, thymoma, angiomatous tumor. He has history of reflux
   so esophageal cancer is in the differential, but not likely. Germ cell
   tumor are very common in this age group. Primary lung cancer is very
   unlikely.
   - TSH
   - Serum calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone
   - Alpha fetoprotein
   - beta human chorionic gonadotropin
   - Consider Fractionated 24-hour urinary metanephrines and
   catecholamines
   - f/u biopsy results
   - Follow up final path report from [**Location (un) 755**]
   - Onc consult once pathology results back
   - call out to oncology service in AM

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of smoking and hemoptysis who was recently diagnosed with a mediastinal mass and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has undergone a rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and is currently in the ICU for monitoring.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, and blood pressure of 118/69 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and is being monitored for respiratory support.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (12.7 K/uL), platelet count (367 K/uL), and lactate dehydrogenase (152 IU/L). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level (4.9 mEq/L).

The patient's medical history includes smoking, hemoptysis, and a mediastinal mass. The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and has been taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for this condition.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Bleeding: The patient's history of hemoptysis and the presence of a mediastinal mass may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly with the use of heparin.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a small provoked PE in the left upper lobe segmental artery, which may worsen with the use of heparin.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but may deteriorate with the progression of the mediastinal mass or the development of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of smoking and the presence of a mediastinal mass may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to the presence of a mediastinal mass, which may increase the risk of infection.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Monitoring: The patient will be closely monitored for signs of bleeding, respiratory failure, and cardiac complications.
2. Anticoagulation: The patient will receive heparin therapy to prevent further clotting and to treat the PE.
3. Pain management: The patient will receive pain management with tylenol and other medications as needed.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient will receive prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
5. Follow-up: The patient will be followed up with oncology consult once pathology results are available, and will undergo further testing and treatment as necessary."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU for unknown reasons. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 130/76 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 95%.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12.4 g/dL, and a white blood cell count of 8.2 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination is notable for right lower extremity edema, which is absent. The patient's abdominal examination is normal, with soft and non-tender bowel sounds present.

The patient is receiving various medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis. The patient is also receiving antibiotics, although the specific type is not mentioned.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's use of heparin sodium, there is a risk of bleeding complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 95%, which may indicate early signs of respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, which may indicate an infection.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is mildly decreased, which may indicate ongoing bleeding or inadequate red blood cell production.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium level is slightly elevated, which may indicate kidney dysfunction or other underlying conditions.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is not well-documented, which may indicate a risk of malnutrition or inadequate nutrition.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk of developing a stress ulcer due to their critical illness and prolonged mechanical ventilation.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications and optimize their care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 453**] [**Known lastname 14231**] is a 36 year-old gentleman with history of smoking
   and hemoptysis found to have mediastinal mass and a pulmonary embolus
   .
36 year old man with very large left lung/mediastinal mass
status-post a second biopsy.  The first biopsy wasn't fully
diagnostic (and we're awaiting transfer of the path slides to
[**Hospital1 19**] for review) but did stain positive for TTF-1; this in
conjunction with his normal hCG, aFP, and LDH makes the whole
picture very concerning for advanced lung cancer.  I explained
this to the patient, but also explained that we need to get a
definitive tissue diagnosis prior to starting any sort of
therapy.  If this does end up being non-small/squamous cell lung
carcinoma (which is highest on our differential), then he would
likely benefit from chemoradiation to treat this large primary
   mass (even if he does have distant metastases).
   #. Pulmonary embolus - Small provoked PE in the left upper lobe
   segmental artery. It is unclear how much the mass effect compressing
   the L pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins is contributing to low
   flow and stasis, versus hypercoagulable state secondary to malignancy.
   Now s/p  bronch and per IP ok to restart heparin.
   - restarted heparin post-bronch then transitioned to subcutaneous
   heparin only
   .
   #. Hemoptysis - Patient with pulmonary embolus (small) and a very large
   mediastinal mass. He has been having hemoptysis for ~1 month and now is
   s/p CT-guided biopsy. The most likely source in the mass given its
   proximity with the airway. NO clear evidence of fistula are seen. He is
   breathing comfortably. Now he may be at higher risk of bleeding given
   heparin gtt.  Stable over the course of his [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] stay while on
   heparin.  Now post bronch and stable
   - No evidence of bleeding
   - If major bleeding consider embolization/intubation
   - 2 Large IVs
   - T&S with 2 units cross-matched
   .
   #. Mediastinal mass - Patient has a mediastinal mass of ~14 cm X ~5 cm.
   He is a smoker with 22 pack-year. By location differential diagnosis
   includes lymphoma, thymoma, angiomatous tumor. He has history of reflux
   so esophageal cancer is in the differential, but not likely. Germ cell
   tumors are very common in this age group. Primary lung cancer is very
   unlikely.

Summary:

The patient, a 36-year-old man, is admitted to the ICU with a mediastinal mass and a pulmonary embolus. He has a history of smoking and hemoptysis. The patient has undergone a CT-guided biopsy, which showed positive staining for TTF-1, suggesting advanced lung cancer. He is awaiting a definitive tissue diagnosis before starting therapy. The patient has been started on heparin for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis and is being monitored for bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of bleeding due to the heparin therapy and the presence of a pulmonary embolus. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values is necessary to detect any signs of bleeding.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's mediastinal mass may be compressing the lungs and pulmonary vessels, leading to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory rate is necessary to detect any signs of respiratory distress.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's mediastinal mass may be compressing the heart, leading to cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring of cardiac rhythm and blood pressure is necessary to detect any signs of cardiac distress.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to cancer and the presence of a central line make him at risk of infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values is necessary to detect any signs of infection.
5. Metastatic spread: The patient's cancer may have metastasized to other parts of the body, leading to systemic symptoms such as pain, weight loss, and fatigue. Close monitoring of laboratory values and imaging studies is necessary to detect any signs of metastatic spread.
6. DVT: The patient is at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to the presence of a pulmonary embolus and the use of heparin. Close monitoring of lower extremity circulation and laboratory values is necessary to detect any signs of DVT.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory values closely for any signs of bleeding, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, infection, metastatic spread, or DVT.
2. Consider consulting with a pulmonologist or cardiothoracic surgeon to discuss the patient's management and potential treatment options.
3. Continue to provide supportive care, including oxygen therapy, pain management, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
4. Consider ordering additional imaging studies, such as a CT scan or MRI, to further evaluate the patient's mediastinal mass and pulmonary embolus.
5. Consider ordering additional laboratory tests, such as a complete blood count and blood chemistry panel, to monitor the patient's overall health and detect any signs of metastatic spread.
6. Consider consulting with an oncologist to discuss the patient's cancer treatment options and potential side effects."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 453**] [**Known lastname 14231**] is a 36 year-old gentleman with history of smoking
   and hemoptysis found to have mediastinal mass and a pulmonary embolus
   .
36 year old man with very large left lung/mediastinal mass
status-post a second biopsy.  The first biopsy wasn't fully
diagnostic (and we're awaiting transfer of the path slides to
[**Hospital1 19**] for review) but did stain positive for TTF-1; this in
conjunction with his normal hCG, aFP, and LDH makes the whole
picture very concerning for advanced lung cancer.  I explained
this to the patient, but also explained that we need to get a
definitive tissue diagnosis prior to starting any sort of
therapy.  If this does end up being non-small/squamous cell lung
carcinoma (which is highest on our differential), then he would
likely benefit from chemoradiation to treat this large primary
   mass (even if he does have distant metastases).
   #. Pulmonary embolus - Small provoked PE in the left upper lobe
   segmental artery. It is unclear how much the mass effect compressing
   the L pulmonary artery and the pulmonary veins is contributing to low
   flow and stasis, versus hypercoagulable state secondary to malignancy.
   Now s/p  bronch and per IP ok to restart heparin.
   -          restarted heparin post-bronch then transitioned to
   subcutaneous heparin only
   -          hold off on further IV heparin or Lovenox for now until it
   is clear no need for procedure and hemoptysis has stopped
   .
   #. Hemoptysis - Patient with pulmonary embolus (small) and a very large
   mediastinal mass. He has been having hemoptysis for ~1 month and now is
   s/p CT-guided biopsy. The most likely source in the mass given its
   proximity with the airway. NO clear evidence of fistula are seen. He is
   breathing comfortably. Now he may be at higher risk of bleeding given
   heparin gtt.  Stable over the course of his [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] stay while on
   heparin.  Now post bronch and stable. Minimal current sx (mostly old
   blood in early AM)
   - If major bleeding consider embolization/intubation
   - 2 Large IVs (consider removing one line as patient reports irritation
   and bleeding [**Doctor Last Name 533**])
   - T&S with 2 units cross-matched
   .
   #. Mediastinal mass - Patient has a mediastinal mass of ~14 cm X ~5 cm.
   He is a smoker with 22 pack-year. By location differential diagnosis
   includes lymphoma, thymoma, angiomatous tumor. He has history of reflux
   so esophageal cancer is in the differential, but not likely. Germ cell
   tumors are very common in this age group. Primary lung cancer is very
   unlikely.  HCG, AFP within normal limits.
   - Serum calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone
   - Consider Fractionated 24-hour urinary metanephrines and
   catecholamines
   - f/u biopsy results
   - Follow up final path report from [**Location (un) 755**]
   - F/U oncology recs
   - F/U rad onc recs (or sign out to onc team if patient is transferred).
   Could also be structural/mechanical related to mass.
   - Call out to oncology service when bed available
   .
   # Tachycardia. Possibly secondary to pain/anxiety (decreases with
   sleep).
   - Trial of low-dose benzo (0.5 mg PO Ativan) to evaluate effect
   .
   #. Smoking - Patient stopped smoking 3 weeks ago.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 36-year-old male with a history of smoking and hemoptysis who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of mediastinal mass and pulmonary embolus. The patient has undergone a CT-guided biopsy, which stained positive for TTF-1, suggesting advanced lung cancer.

The patient's current condition is stable, with no overnight events reported. He is awaiting bed availability on the oncology floor and is expected to be transferred once stable.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Pulmonary embolus: The patient has a small provoked PE in the left upper lobe segmental artery, which is likely contributing to low flow and stasis. He is currently receiving subcutaneous heparin and is at risk of bleeding.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient has been experiencing hemoptysis for approximately one month and has undergone a CT-guided biopsy. The most likely source of the bleeding is the mediastinal mass, which is proximal to the airway.
3. Mediastinal mass: The patient has a large mediastinal mass measuring approximately 14 cm x 5 cm, which is causing compression of the left pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins. The differential diagnosis includes lymphoma, thymoma, angiomatous tumor, and germ cell tumors.
4. Tachycardia: The patient has a heart rate of 101 bpm, which may be secondary to pain or anxiety.
5. Smoking: The patient stopped smoking three weeks ago.

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.2-11.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 12.4-14.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 143-194 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8-0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 101-114 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: within normal limits
* Coagulation studies: PT 13.3, PTT 29.1, INR 1.1

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis)
* Infusions (not specified)
* Other medications (not specified)

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Restarting heparin post-bronch and transitioning to subcutaneous heparin only.
2. Holding off on further IV heparin or Lovenox until it is clear that no procedure is needed and hemoptysis has stopped.
3. Monitoring for bleeding and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
4. Continuing pain management with Tylenol and oxycodone PRN.
5. Monitoring for signs of pulmonary embolism and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
6. Transferring the patient to the oncology floor once stable.

The patient's disposition is to be transferred to the oncology floor once bed availability is confirmed."
