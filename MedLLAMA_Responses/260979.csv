   HPI:
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary
   to alpha-1 anti-trypsin disease c/b encephalopathy and varices (never
   bled in the past), COPD, and type 2 diabetes who presented on [**11-10**]
   with AMS presumed due to hepatic encephalopathy, now admitted to the
   MICU with upper GI bleeding. This evening she had a bloody stool
   followed by hematemesis of 2 cupfuls of blood. She remained
   hemodynamically stable (BP 100s, HR 80s). An NG tube was placed and
   lavage revealed blood and clot that did not clear after 300 cc's. HCT
   returned at 29.6 (from 33.6). She was transferred to the ICU for urgent
   endoscopy.
   .
   On arrival to the ICU, she endorsed some lightheadedness, but denied CP
   or SOB. Denied prior variceal bleeding. A 3rd PIV was placed and the
   first unit of PRBCs was hung. She was consented for EGD, but as the
   procedure was beginning, she vomited a very large amount of BRB and
   clot. BP dropped to 80s/40s. 2 more units were rapidly transfused and
   she was urgently intubated for airway protection. Peripheral
   phenylephrine was also briefly started. After a total of 5 units of
   pRBCs were tranfused, BP had improved to 150s, so phenylephrine easily
   turned off. Repeat endoscopy showed continued blood welling up into the
   esophagus and filling the stomach, unable to visualize/treat varices
   due to amount of blood. The procedure was aborted and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1048**] tube
   was placed. IR and anesthesia were then consulted for urgent TIPS.
   .
   Of note, her hospital course has been significant for a 5L paracentesis
   performed [**11-12**] (negative for SBP), and [**11-25**] positive blood cultures
   from [**11-13**] (presumed contaminant), and possible PNA for which she was
   intially started on broad spectrum antibiotics, more recently tapered
   down to just levofloxacin.

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   This is a 72 year old female with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency
   leading to cirrhosis and varices who was admitted for progressive
   decline in mental status for one month, hospital course complicated by
   PNA, who is now transferred to the ICU for upper GI bleeding.
   .
   # UGIB - Likely due to variceal bleeding but other ddx included
   hypertensive gastropathy, PUD, esophagitis. Briefly with evidence of
   hypovolemic shock. but this resolved with aggressive transfusions.
   -- current access is 3 PIVs
   -- will obtain trauma line
   -- q4h HCT, Ca, coags with goal HCT >30
   -- IV octreotide bolus and gtt
   -- IV pantoprazole q12
   -- continue levofloxacin for GIB SBP ppx
   -- add flagyl for anaerobic coverage given ? aspiration, insufflated
   [**Last Name (un) **] tube causing possible esophageal microperforations
   -- hold ASA and sQ heparin
   -- [**Last Name (un) **] tube in place
   -- to IR for TIPS tonight
   .
   # Respiratory failure - intubated for airway protection in setting of
   large UGIB.
   -- will wean to PSV with plan to attempt extubation after TIPS and
   hemostasis is demonstrated with [**Last Name (un) **] deflated
   -- serial ABGs to ensure adequate gas exchange
   -- VAP bundle, daily wake ups, HOB elevation
   .
   # PNA: Blood cx from [**11-13**] were positive 48 hours later with coag neg
   staph [**11-25**] bottle, prompting vanc/cefepime/levo initiated on [**11-13**].
   stopped cefepime ([**11-15**]) and vanc ([**11-17**]), now only on levo.
   -- continue levofloxacin as above
   -- add flagyl for aspiration coverage
   .
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy - had resolved prior to ICU tranfer
   -- continue lactulose with goal 3 BMs daily
   .
   # Cirrhosis - likely secondary to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency with
   possible autoimmune component (anti-smooth muscle antibody positive).
   No evidence of SBP on diagnostic paracentesis x 2 (last on [**11-12**]). MELD
   score 16. Of note, ascitic protein < 1 mg/dL, putting her at increased
   risk for SBP.
   -- levoflox for SBP ppx
   -- lactulose
   -- f/u liver recs
   -- obtain OSH records re: alpha 1 levels, EGD reports
   .
   # Renal failure - admission Creatinine 1.5, elevated from 1.0 five
   months ago. Has trended 1.2-1.4. At high risk for developing renal
   dysfunction given episode of hypovolemia, hypotension, and need for
   contrast during TIPS placement
   -- hemodynamics now much improved
   -- trend Cr
   -- avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # COPD - lungs do not appear hyperinflated on CXR
   -- obtain PFTs from OSH
   -- albuterol/atrovent MDIs
   .
   # Diabetes, type 2 - Patient was told to stop her detemir and
   glyburide. Per daughter, recent [**Name (NI) 10714**] 7%
   -- [**Name2 (NI) 10715**] fs, continue ISS for elevated BSs, DM diet when eating
   .
   # Hypertension - Per daughter, prior anti-hypertensives stopped as
   patient was getting lightheaded and falling.
   -- continue to hold furosemide and spironolactone
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia - cont. simvastatin 80 mg daily
   .
   # Obstructive sleep apnea - unclear how diagnosis was made. Will try to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 72-year-old woman with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency leading to cirrhosis and varices, admitted to the ICU for upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
* She has a history of cirrhosis, varices, COPD, and type 2 diabetes.
* The patient has been bleeding briskly from varices and has required multiple units of packed red blood cells.
* She has been intubated for airway protection and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Variceal bleeding:** The patient's bleeding has been significant, and there is a risk of further bleeding or rebleeding.
2. **Hepatic encephalopathy:** The patient's mental status has been altered, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
3. **Respiratory failure:** The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
4. **Renal failure:** The patient has a history of kidney disease and is at risk of developing acute kidney injury due to hypovolemia, hypotension, and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
5. **Infection:** The patient has a history of pneumonia and has been prescribed antibiotics, which increases the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections.
6. **Gastrointestinal bleeding:** The patient has a history of bleeding from varices, and there is a risk of further bleeding or rebleeding.
7. **Hypovolemic shock:** The patient has experienced hypovolemic shock, which increases the risk of further complications.
8. **Thrombocytopenia:** The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
9. **Coagulopathy:** The patient has a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio (INR), which increases the risk of bleeding complications.

**Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and adjust therapy as needed.
* Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust therapy as needed.
* Wean the patient off mechanical ventilation and attempt extubation after TIPS placement and hemostasis are demonstrated.
* Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust therapy as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's infection status and adjust antibiotic therapy as needed.
* Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and adjust therapy as needed.
* Monitor the patient's hypovolemic status and adjust therapy as needed.
* Monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and adjust therapy as needed.
* Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and adjust therapy as needed."

   Changes to medical and family history:
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary
   to alpha-1 anti-trypsin disease c/b encephalopathy and varices (never
   bled in the past), COPD, and type 2 diabetes who presented on [**11-10**]
   with AMS presumed due to hepatic encephalopathy, now admitted to the
   MICU with upper GI bleeding. This evening she had a bloody stool
   followed by hematemesis of 2 cupfuls of blood. She remained
   hemodynamically stable (BP 100s, HR 80s). An NG tube was placed and
   lavage revealed blood and clot that did not clear after 300 cc's. HCT
   returned at 29.6 (from 33.6). She was transferred to the ICU for urgent
   endoscopy.
   .
   On arrival to the ICU, she endorsed some lightheadedness, but denied CP
   or SOB. Denied prior variceal bleeding. A 3rd PIV was placed and the
   first unit of PRBCs was hung. She was consented for EGD, but as the
   procedure was beginning, she vomited a very large amount of BRB and
   clot. BP dropped to 80s/40s. 2 more units were rapidly transfused and
   she was urgently intubated for airway protection. Peripheral
   phenylephrine was also briefly started. After a total of 5 units of
   pRBCs were tranfused, BP had improved to 150s, so phenylephrine easily
   turned off. Repeat endoscopy showed continued blood welling up into the
   esophagus and filling the stomach, unable to visualize/treat varices
   due to amount of blood. The procedure was aborted and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1048**] tube
   was placed. IR and anesthesia were then consulted for urgent TIPS.
   .
   Of note, her hospital course has been significant for a 5L paracentesis
   performed [**11-12**] (negative for SBP), and [**11-25**] positive blood cultures
   from [**11-13**] (presumed contaminant), and possible PNA for which she was
   intially started on broad spectrum antibiotics, more recently tapered
   down to just levofloxacin.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Changes to medical and family history:
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary
   to alpha-1 anti-trypsin disease c/b encephalopathy and varices (never
   bled in the past), COPD, and type 2 diabetes who presented on [**11-10**]
   with AMS presumed due to hepatic encephalopathy, now admitted to the
   MICU with upper GI bleeding. This evening she had a bloody stool
   followed by hematemesis of 2 cupfuls of blood. She remained
   hemodynamically stable (BP 100s, HR 80s). An NG tube was placed and
   lavage revealed blood and clot that did not clear after 300 cc's. HCT
   returned at 29.6 (from 33.6). She was transferred to the ICU for urgent
   endoscopy.
   .
   On arrival to the ICU, she endorsed some lightheadedness, but denied CP
   or SOB. Denied prior variceal bleeding. A 3rd PIV was placed and the
   first unit of PRBCs was hung. She was consented for EGD, but as the
   procedure was beginning, she vomited a very large amount of BRB and
   clot. BP dropped to 80s/40s. 2 more units were rapidly transfused and
   she was urgently intubated for airway protection. Peripheral
   phenylephrine was also briefly started. After a total of 5 units of
   pRBCs were tranfused, BP had improved to 150s, so phenylephrine easily
   turned off. Repeat endoscopy showed continued blood welling up into the
   esophagus and filling the stomach, unable to visualize/treat varices
   due to amount of blood. The procedure was aborted and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1048**] tube
   was placed. IR and anesthesia were then consulted for urgent TIPS.
   .
   Of note, her hospital course has been significant for a 5L paracentesis
   performed [**11-12**] (negative for SBP), and [**11-25**] positive blood cultures
   from [**11-13**] (presumed contaminant), and possible PNA for which she was
   intially started on broad spectrum antibiotics, more recently tapered
   down to just levofloxacin.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 72-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary to alpha-1 anti-trypsin disease, encephalopathy, and varices who presented with acute mental status changes and was admitted to the ICU for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). She had a bloody stool, followed by hematemesis, and was transferred to the ICU for urgent endoscopy. She was intubated for airway protection and received multiple units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for bleeding. She has a history of pneumonia (PNA), positive blood cultures, and possible aspiration pneumonia. She is also at high risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) due to her cirrhosis and ascitic protein levels.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE):** The patient's history of cirrhosis and encephalopathy puts her at high risk for HE, which can worsen her mental status and increase her risk of bleeding.
2. **Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB):** The patient's ongoing bleeding from varices or other causes can lead to hypovolemic shock, electrolyte imbalances, and coagulopathy.
3. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's intubation for airway protection and ongoing bleeding can increase her risk of respiratory failure, which can worsen her hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
4. **Renal Failure:** The patient's history of cirrhosis and recent hypovolemia puts her at high risk for developing renal dysfunction, which can worsen her electrolyte imbalances and increase her risk of bleeding.
5. **Infections:** The patient's history of PNA and positive blood cultures puts her at high risk for developing secondary infections, which can worsen her bleeding and respiratory failure.
6. **Coagulopathy:** The patient's bleeding and recent transfusions can lead to coagulopathy, which can worsen her bleeding and increase her risk of thrombotic complications.
7. **Aspiration Pneumonia:** The patient's history of aspiration and possible esophageal microperforations puts her at high risk for developing aspiration pneumonia, which can worsen her respiratory failure and increase her risk of bleeding.
8. **Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP):** The patient's history of cirrhosis and ascitic protein levels puts her at high risk for developing SBP, which can worsen her bleeding and increase her risk of sepsis.

**Assessment and Plan:**

The patient's assessment and plan should focus on addressing her ongoing bleeding, respiratory failure, and coagulopathy, while also managing her risk of infections, renal failure, and aspiration pneumonia. The plan should include:

* Continuation of IV octreotide and pantoprazole for bleeding control
* Intubation for airway protection and weaning to PSV
* Serial ABGs to ensure adequate gas exchange
* VAP bundle, daily wake-ups, and HOB elevation
* Continuation of lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
* Monitoring of renal function and avoidance of nephrotoxins
* Management of coagulopathy with platelet transfusions and vitamin K
* Monitoring for signs of aspiration pneumonia and sepsis
* Consideration of TIPS placement for bleeding control
* Close monitoring of the patient's bleeding, respiratory, and renal status."

   HPI:
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary
   to alpha-1 anti-trypsin disease c/b encephalopathy and varices (never
   bled in the past), COPD, and type 2 diabetes who presented on [**11-10**]
   with AMS presumed due to hepatic encephalopathy, now admitted to the
   MICU with upper GI bleeding. This evening she had a bloody stool
   followed by hematemesis of 2 cupfuls of blood. She remained
   hemodynamically stable (BP 100s, HR 80s). An NG tube was placed and
   lavage revealed blood and clot that did not clear after 300 cc's. HCT
   returned at 29.6 (from 33.6). She was transferred to the ICU for urgent
   endoscopy.
   .
   On arrival to the ICU, she endorsed some lightheadedness, but denied CP
   or SOB. Denied prior variceal bleeding. A 3rd PIV was placed and the
   first unit of PRBCs was hung. She was consented for EGD, but as the
   procedure was beginning, she vomited a very large amount of BRB and
   clot. BP dropped to 80s/40s. 2 more units were rapidly transfused and
   she was urgently intubated for airway protection. Peripheral
   phenylephrine was also briefly started. After a total of 5 units of
   pRBCs were tranfused, BP had improved to 150s, so phenylephrine easily
   turned off. Repeat endoscopy showed continued blood welling up into the
   esophagus and filling the stomach, unable to visualize/treat varices
   due to amount of blood. The procedure was aborted and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1048**] tube
   was placed. IR and anesthesia were then consulted for urgent TIPS.
   .
   Of note, her hospital course has been significant for a 5L paracentesis
   performed [**11-12**] (negative for SBP), and [**11-25**] positive blood cultures
   from [**11-13**] (presumed contaminant), and possible PNA for which she was
   intially started on broad spectrum antibiotics, more recently tapered
   down to just levofloxacin.

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   This is a 72 year old female with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency
   leading to cirrhosis and varices who was admitted for progressive
   decline in mental status for one month, hospital course complicated by
   PNA, who is now transferred to the ICU for upper GI bleeding.
   .
   # UGIB - Likely due to variceal bleeding but other ddx included
   hypertensive gastropathy, PUD, esophagitis. Briefly with evidence of
   hypovolemic shock. but this resolved with aggressive transfusions.
   -- current access is 3 PIVs
   -- will obtain trauma line
   -- q4h HCT, Ca, coags with goal HCT >30
   -- IV octreotide bolus and gtt
   -- IV pantoprazole q12
   -- continue levofloxacin for GIB SBP ppx
   -- add flagyl for anaerobic coverage given ? aspiration, insufflated
   [**Last Name (un) **] tube causing possible esophageal microperforations
   -- hold ASA and sQ heparin
   -- [**Last Name (un) **] tube in place
   -- to IR for TIPS tonight
   .
   # Respiratory failure - intubated for airway protection in setting of
   large UGIB.
   -- will wean to PSV with plan to attempt extubation after TIPS and
   hemostasis is demonstrated with [**Last Name (un) **] deflated
   -- serial ABGs to ensure adequate gas exchange
   -- VAP bundle, daily wake ups, HOB elevation
   .
   # PNA: Blood cx from [**11-13**] were positive 48 hours later with coag neg
   staph [**11-25**] bottle, prompting vanc/cefepime/levo initiated on [**11-13**].
   stopped cefepime ([**11-15**]) and vanc ([**11-17**]), now only on levo.
   -- continue levofloxacin as above
   -- add flagyl for aspiration coverage
   .
   # Hepatic Encephalopathy - had resolved prior to ICU tranfer
   -- continue lactulose with goal 3 BMs daily
   .
   # Cirrhosis - likely secondary to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency with
   possible autoimmune component (anti-smooth muscle antibody positive).
   No evidence of SBP on diagnostic paracentesis x 2 (last on [**11-12**]). MELD
   score 16. Of note, ascitic protein < 1 mg/dL, putting her at increased
   risk for SBP.
   -- levoflox for SBP ppx
   -- lactulose
   -- f/u liver recs
   -- obtain OSH records re: alpha 1 levels, EGD reports
   .
   # Renal failure - admission Creatinine 1.5, elevated from 1.0 five
   months ago. Has trended 1.2-1.4. At high risk for developing renal
   dysfunction given episode of hypovolemia, hypotension, and need for
   contrast during TIPS placement
   -- hemodynamics now much improved
   -- trend Cr
   -- avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # COPD - lungs do not appear hyperinflated on CXR
   -- obtain PFTs from OSH
   -- albuterol/atrovent MDIs
   .
   # Diabetes, type 2 - Patient was told to stop her detemir and
   glyburide. Per daughter, recent [**Name (NI) 10714**] 7%
   -- [**Name2 (NI) 10715**] fs, continue ISS for elevated BSs, DM diet when eating
   .
   # Hypertension - Per daughter, prior anti-hypertensives stopped as
   patient was getting lightheaded and falling.
   -- continue to hold furosemide and spironolactone
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia - cont. simvastatin 80 mg daily
   .
   # Obstructive sleep apnea - unclear how diagnosis was made. Will try to
   obtain OSH records in AM.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old woman with alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency, cirrhosis, and varices who was admitted to the ICU for upper GI bleeding and altered mental status attributed to hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient has a history of cirrhosis, varices, COPD, and type 2 diabetes. She presented with altered mental status, which was presumed to be due to hepatic encephalopathy. She had a bloody stool followed by hematemesis, and was transferred to the ICU for urgent endoscopy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure of 103/52 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 96% on 40% fraction of inspired oxygen.

The patient has been diagnosed with upper GI bleeding, which is likely due to variceal bleeding. She has been treated with octreotide bolus and infusion, pantoprazole, and levofloxacin. She has also been started on flagyl for anaerobic coverage.

The patient has a history of PNA, which was diagnosed based on blood cultures that grew coag-negative Staphylococcus. She has been treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and levoquin, and is currently on levofloxacin.

The patient has a MELD score of 16, indicating a high risk for developing SBP. She has been treated with lactulose to prevent hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient has a history of renal failure, with an admission creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL. She is at high risk for developing renal dysfunction due to her episode of hypovolemia, hypotension, and need for contrast during TIPS placement.

The patient has a history of COPD, and her lungs do not appear hyperinflated on CXR. She has been prescribed albuterol and atrovent inhalers.

The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, and her daughter reports that she was told to stop taking her detemir and glyburide. The patient has been prescribed insulin sliding scale and diet therapy.

The patient has a history of hypertension, and her daughter reports that she was told to stop taking her anti-hypertensive medications due to lightheadedness and falls. The patient's blood pressure is currently stable.

The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, and is currently taking simvastatin 80 mg daily.

The patient has a history of obstructive sleep apnea, and will be trying to obtain OSH records in the morning.

The patient has a history of osteoporosis, and is currently taking calcium and vitamin D supplements.

The patient's access is secure, with three peripheral IV lines and an arterial line. She is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics for DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU care."

   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary
   to alpha-1 anti-trypsin disease c/b encephalopathy and varices (never
   bled in the past), COPD, and type 2 diabetes who presented on [**11-10**]
   with AMS presumed due to hepatic encephalopathy, now admitted to the
   MICU with upper GI bleeding. This evening she had a bloody stool
   followed by hematemesis of 2 cupfuls of blood. She remained
   hemodynamically stable (BP 100s, HR 80s). An NG tube was placed and
   lavage revealed blood and clot that did not clear after 300 cc's. HCT
   returned at 29.6 (from 33.6). She was transferred to the ICU for urgent
   endoscopy.
   .
   On arrival to the ICU, she endorsed some lightheadedness, but denied CP
   or SOB. Denied prior variceal bleeding. A 3rd PIV was placed and the
   first unit of PRBCs was hung. She was consented for EGD, but as the
   procedure was beginning, she vomited a very large amount of BRB and
   clot. BP dropped to 80s/40s. 2 more units were rapidly transfused and
   she was urgently intubated for airway protection. Peripheral
   phenylephrine was also briefly started. After a total of 5 units of
   pRBCs were tranfused, BP had improved to 150s, so phenylephrine easily
   turned off. Repeat endoscopy showed continued blood welling up into the
   esophagus and filling the stomach, unable to visualize/treat varices
   due to amount of blood. The procedure was aborted and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1048**] tube
   was placed. IR and anesthesia were then consulted for urgent TIPS.
   .
   Of note, her hospital course has been significant for a 5L paracentesis
   performed [**11-12**] (negative for SBP), and [**11-25**] positive blood cultures
   from [**11-13**] (presumed contaminant), and possible PNA for which she was
   intially started on broad spectrum antibiotics, more recently tapered
   down to just levofloxacin.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   HPI:
   Mrs. [**Known lastname **] is a 72 year old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary
   to alpha-1 anti-trypsin disease c/b encephalopathy and varices (never
   bled in the past), COPD, and type 2 diabetes who presented on [**11-10**]
   with AMS presumed due to hepatic encephalopathy, now admitted to the
   MICU with upper GI bleeding. This evening she had a bloody stool
   followed by hematemesis of 2 cupfuls of blood. She remained
   hemodynamically stable (BP 100s, HR 80s). An NG tube was placed and
   lavage revealed blood and clot that did not clear after 300 cc's. HCT
   returned at 29.6 (from 33.6). She was transferred to the ICU for urgent
   endoscopy.
   .
   On arrival to the ICU, she endorsed some lightheadedness, but denied CP
   or SOB. Denied prior variceal bleeding. A 3rd PIV was placed and the
   first unit of PRBCs was hung. She was consented for EGD, but as the
   procedure was beginning, she vomited a very large amount of BRB and
   clot. BP dropped to 80s/40s. 2 more units were rapidly transfused and
   she was urgently intubated for airway protection. Peripheral
   phenylephrine was also briefly started. After a total of 5 units of
   pRBCs were tranfused, BP had improved to 150s, so phenylephrine easily
   turned off. Repeat endoscopy showed continued blood welling up into the
   esophagus and filling the stomach, unable to visualize/treat varices
   due to amount of blood. The procedure was aborted and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1048**] tube
   was placed. IR and anesthesia were then consulted for urgent TIPS.
   .
   Of note, her hospital course has been significant for a 5L paracentesis
   performed [**11-12**] (negative for SBP), and [**11-25**] positive blood cultures
   from [**11-13**] (presumed contaminant), and possible PNA for which she was
   intially started on broad spectrum antibiotics, more recently tapered
   down to just levofloxacin.

Summary:

Mrs. [**Known Lastname**] is a 72-year-old woman with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, cirrhosis, and varices who was admitted to the hospital with altered mental status (AMS) attributed to hepatic encephalopathy. She had a history of cirrhosis, COPD, and type 2 diabetes. During her hospital course, she experienced upper GI bleeding (UGIB) due to varices, which was managed with endoscopy and transfusions. She was also diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) and was treated with antibiotics. She was transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.8°C, heart rate 87 bpm, blood pressure 103/52 mmHg, respiratory rate 9 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 96%.
* Laboratory results: Hemoglobin 11.8 g/dL, hematocrit 33.2%, platelet count 157 x 10^9/L, and white blood cell count 19.9 x 10^9/L.
* Radiology: CT scan of the torso showed a borderline low-lying endotracheal tube, small pleural effusions, and atelectasis.
* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

Potential medical complications:

* Bleeding: The patient has a history of UGIB due to varices, and there is a risk of further bleeding.
* Infection: The patient has a history of PNA and is currently receiving antibiotics.
* Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of AMS attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of respiratory failure.
* Renal failure: The patient has a history of admission creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and may be at risk for cardiovascular complications.

Assessment and plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding status and manage any further bleeding episodes.
* Continue to manage the patient's infection with antibiotics.
* Monitor the patient's hepatic encephalopathy and manage any further deterioration.
* Continue to provide respiratory support with mechanical ventilation and monitor for signs of respiratory failure.
* Monitor the patient's renal function and manage any further deterioration.
* Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and manage any further complications.
* Continue to provide prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
* Monitor the patient's mental status and manage any further deterioration.
* Continue to provide nutrition and glycemic control as per the plan.

In conclusion, Mrs. [**Known Lastname**] is a complex patient with multiple medical conditions who requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis due to A1AT deficiency and encephalopathy, who was transferred to the MICU for massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and underwent an emergent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). The patient's bleeding has stabilized, and he has been extubated and is taking medications and lactulose orally. An abdominal ultrasound is pending, and he needs a speech and swallow evaluation in the morning.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 90/49 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL, platelet count of 175 K/uL, and creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. His microbiology results are pending, and his radiology results show a persistent retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's UGIB has stabilized, but there is still a risk of bleeding, especially with the TIPS in place.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, especially with the TIPS and the presence of foreign bodies.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient's encephalopathy has resolved, but there is still a risk of recurrence.
4. Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis is severe, and there is a risk of liver failure.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is a risk of kidney injury or failure.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is still a risk of respiratory failure.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but there is still a risk of cardiovascular complications, especially with the TIPS.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Administer antibiotics as necessary to prevent infections.
3. Continue to manage the patient's bleeding and encephalopathy.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function and kidney function closely.
5. Consider further interventions, such as liver transplantation, if the patient's liver function continues to decline.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide oxygen therapy as necessary.
7. Consider further interventions, such as cardiac catheterization, if the patient's cardiovascular status continues to decline."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

He underwent emergency transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. Currently, his hematocrit is stable, and he is no longer bleeding. He is extubated, taking medications, and has had an abdominal ultrasound performed, with results pending. He requires a speech and swallow evaluation in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding recurrence: The patient has a history of UGIB and cirrhosis, which increases the risk of recurrent bleeding.
2. Encephalopathy worsening: The patient's history of encephalopathy and current status with impaired health maintenance may lead to worsening of encephalopathy.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen, especially with the risk of pneumonia or respiratory acidosis.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis and TIPS procedure may lead to hepatic encephalopathy, which can worsen his neurological status.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of central lines and catheters increase the risk of infection.
6. Kidney injury: The patient's cirrhosis and potential hypovolemia may lead to kidney injury or worsening of pre-existing kidney dysfunction.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's impaired health maintenance and potential malnutrition may lead to malnutrition, which can worsen his overall condition.
8. Coagulopathy: The patient's cirrhosis and potential bleeding may lead to coagulopathy, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's cirrhosis and potential bleeding may lead to electrolyte imbalance, which can worsen his overall condition.
10. Increased risk of sepsis: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of central lines and catheters increase the risk of sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency, who was transferred to the MICU for massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to esophageal varices. He underwent an emergent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. The patient is currently stable, with a hematocrit that has remained stable since the bleeding stopped. He has been successfully extubated and is taking medications, including lactulose, crushed in apple sauce, and pantoprazole. An abdominal ultrasound is pending, and a speech and swallow evaluation is scheduled for the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of liver disease and encephalopathy, which may recur due to the TIPS procedure or other factors.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has already experienced massive UGIB and may be at risk for further bleeding, especially if the TIPS procedure is not effective.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and is at risk for infections, particularly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate renal insufficiency.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's potassium and magnesium levels are low, which may require close monitoring and potential supplementation.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and may be at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's diet may be limited due to his liver disease, which may lead to nutritional deficiencies.
8. Osteoporosis: The patient is at risk for osteoporosis due to his liver disease and may require close monitoring and potential treatment.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's lipid levels are elevated, which may require treatment and close monitoring.
10. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, which may indicate cardiovascular complications, such as hypertension or hypotension."
