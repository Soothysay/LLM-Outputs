   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   - family meeting as condition unlikely to improve and pt can not stay
   on pressors idefinitely
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.4, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Currently resolved and in sinus rhythm.  Given his
   multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly that benefits outweigh
   risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin
   # FEN:  regular diet
   # ACCESS: PIV and midline; if unable to wean pressors, would need
   central access
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with subQ heparin
   -Pain management with tylenol prn
   # CODE: Confirmed full
   # COMM:  with daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 14322**] (HCP):  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14323**]
   # DISPO: CCU for now

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14262**] today.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Known severe amyloidosis involving bowel, myocardium, kidneys.    This
   has resulted in refractory edema and very low cardiac outputs.   He is
   hypotensive but mentating well.
   Medical Decision Making
   After extensive discussion with the family and the patient, he will be
   made DNR/DNI due to the poor prognosis of his disease.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within

   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased

   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   - family meeting as condition unlikely to improve and pt can not stay
   on pressors idefinitely
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.4, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Currently resolved and in sinus rhythm.  Given his
   multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly that benefits outweigh
   risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin
   # FEN:  regular diet
   # ACCESS: PIV and midline; if unable to wean pressors, would need
   central access
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with subQ heparin
   -Pain management with tylenol prn

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the note by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14262**] today.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Known severe amyloidosis involving bowel, myocardium, kidneys.    This
   has resulted in refractory edema and very low cardiac outputs.   He is
   hypotensive but mentating well.
   Medical Decision Making
   After extensive discussion with the family and the patient, he will be
   made DNR/DNI due to the poor prognosis of his disease.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 1914**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 7145**], MD
   on:[**2120-2-22**] 20:41 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and recently diagnosed amyloidosis. He presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload. The patient's condition is complex, and several potential medical complications can arise.

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium, worsened cardiac function in the context of fluid overload, and possible hypovolemia (intravascular depletion). The patient's troponin is elevated, but this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.
2. Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease: The patient's current creatinine is 4.4, and his baseline creatinine is 2.5-2.9. The patient has poor perfusion and amyloid disease, which may have contributed to his acute renal failure.
3. Amyloid and concern for plasma cell dyscrasia: The patient has poor prognosis due to cardiac and suspected renal involvement. The patient's monoclonal Ig spike suggests possible plasma cell dyscrasia.
4. Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block: The patient's atrial fibrillation and block are likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and conduction system. The patient's multiple comorbidities make anticoagulation a low priority.
5. Chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's chronic diastolic heart failure is likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. The patient would benefit from diuresis, but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during his recent hospital stay.
6. COPD: The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and he continues to receive nebulizers.
7. Iron deficiency anemia: The patient's iron deficiency anemia is managed with regular monitoring.
8. Dyslipidemia: The patient has dyslipidemia, with a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of 44 and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) of 21. The patient is not on a statin, and it is recommended that he stop taking it.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac condition and hypotension increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
2. Renal failure progression: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease, requiring dialysis.
3. Amyloidosis progression: The patient's amyloidosis may progress, leading to further organ dysfunction and potential death.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state increases the risk of infection.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's amyloidosis may cause gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and diastolic heart failure increase the risk of respiratory failure.
7. Sepsis: The patient's immunocompromised state and potential infections increase the risk of sepsis.

To manage these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored, and his treatment plan should be adjusted as needed."

   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.2, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Meets criteria for PPM, but we really need to
   address big picture, ie. HD stability first
 refractory hypotension
   now on pressors. CHADS score is [**11-25**] depending on whether age ought to
   be counted.  Given his multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly
   that benefits outweigh risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin
   # FEN:  regular diet
   # ACCESS: PIV and midline; if unable to wean pressors, would need
   central access

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history, including diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, amyloidosis, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently in the ICU with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of diastolic heart failure and amyloidosis, there is a risk of cardiogenic shock, particularly if he suffers a new insult or if his cardiac function worsens.
2. Renal failure: The patient's current creatinine level of 4.2 is elevated, and he has a history of chronic kidney disease. There is a risk of further renal deterioration, particularly if he does not receive adequate fluid management and dialysis.
3. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to his chronic kidney disease and amyloidosis, making him more susceptible to infection.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and recent history of hypotension may put him at risk for respiratory failure.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and his current use of anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Seizures: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and his current use of anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of seizures.
7. Stroke: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and his current use of anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of stroke.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and his current use of oxygen therapy may increase his risk of pneumonia.
9. Sepsis: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and amyloidosis may increase his risk of sepsis, particularly if he develops an infection.
10. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and his current use of anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

In terms of the patient's current management, the following issues need to be addressed:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension needs to be managed with judicious use of intravenous fluids and vasopressors.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure needs to be managed with dialysis and fluid management.
3. Amyloidosis: The patient's amyloidosis needs to be managed with chemotherapy and other treatments as recommended by his oncologist.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be managed with anticoagulation therapy and rate control measures.
5. COPD: The patient's COPD needs to be managed with oxygen therapy and other treatments as recommended by his pulmonologist.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding needs to be managed with anticoagulation therapy and other treatments as recommended by his gastroenterologist.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers."

   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   - family meeting as condition unlikely to improve and pt can not stay
   on pressors idefinitely
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.4, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Currently resolved and in sinus rhythm.  Given his
   multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly that benefits outweigh
   risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin
   # FEN:  regular diet
   # ACCESS: PIV and midline; if unable to wean pressors, would need
   central access
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with subQ heparin
   -Pain management with tylenol prn
   # CODE: Confirmed full

   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele

   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with ongoing hypotension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 78/47 mmHg. The patient is receiving norepinephrine infusion to support blood pressure. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 98% on nasal cannula oxygen. The patient's neurological examination is limited due to the patient's condition, and the patient is not able to respond to commands.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia (Hct 28.3%), thrombocytopenia (Plt 287 K/uL), and elevated creatinine (4.4 mg/dL). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated lactate level (1.0 mmol/L). The patient's cardiac enzymes are mildly elevated, with a troponin-T level of 0.44 ng/mL.

The patient has a midline catheter and a multi-lumen catheter in place, and the patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate level and mild anemia may indicate the presence of sepsis, which could worsen the patient's condition.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and mild anemia may indicate the presence of acute kidney injury, which could worsen the patient's condition.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypotension and tachypnea may lead to respiratory failure, which could worsen the patient's condition.
6. Infection: The patient's presence in the ICU and the use of invasive devices may increase the risk of infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection."

   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.2, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Meets criteria for PPM, but we really need to
   address big picture, ie. HD stability first
 refractory hypotension
   now on pressors. CHADS score is [**11-25**] depending on whether age ought to
   be counted.  Given his multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly
   that benefits outweigh risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin
   # FEN:  regular diet
   # ACCESS: PIV and midline; if unable to wean pressors, would need
   central access
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with subQ heparin
   -Pain management with tylenol prn
   # CODE: Confirmed full
   # COMM:  with daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 14322**] (HCP):  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 14323**]

   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.2, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Meets criteria for PPM, but we really need to
   address big picture, ie. HD stability first
 refractory hypotension
   now on pressors. CHADS score is [**11-25**] depending on whether age ought to
   be counted.  Given his multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly
   that benefits outweigh risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin
   # FEN:  regular diet
   # ACCESS: PIV and midline; if unable to wean pressors, would need
   central access
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with subQ heparin
   -Pain management with tylenol prn

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history, including diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and recently diagnosed amyloidosis. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.

The patient's condition is unstable, and he is requiring vasopressors to maintain his blood pressure. His cardiac output is elevated, and his systemic vascular resistance is low, suggesting vasodilatory hypotension. His echocardiogram shows mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and a large left pleural effusion.

The patient's laboratory results are notable for elevated troponin levels, indicating possible myocardial injury. His EKG shows atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate, and his cardiac biomarkers are elevated. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are elevated, indicating acute renal failure.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and hyperglycemia, which may have contributed to his current condition. He also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), iron deficiency anemia, and dyslipidemia.

The patient's prognosis is poor due to his complex medical condition, and his healthcare providers are discussing palliative care options with him. His family has been informed of his condition, and his daughter is expected to visit him soon.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's heart failure and amyloidosis increase his risk of cardiac complications, including cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure and chronic kidney disease increase his risk of further kidney damage, including acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease progression.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's COPD and respiratory failure increase his risk of respiratory complications, including pneumonia, respiratory failure, and respiratory arrest.
4. Infectious complications: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central lines and catheters increase his risk of infectious complications, including sepsis, pneumonia, and catheter-related infections.
5. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's coagulopathy and presence of central lines and catheters increase his risk of hemorrhagic complications, including bleeding, hematomas, and hemarthrosis.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications. His healthcare providers should continue to work together to optimize his care and improve his outcomes."

   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension
   Amyloid infiltration of vessels and myocardium likely responsible for
   hypotension. [**Month (only) 51**] also be contribution by worsened cardiac function in
   context of fluid overload. Note that he often had episodes of
   hypotension with SBPs in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He
   endorses poor PO intake and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there
   may be a component of hypovolemia (intarvacular depletion).  No fevers,
   leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an infection.  Cardiogenic shock
   unlikely unless he suffered new insult, and although his troponin is
   elevated, this is in the setting of worsening renal failure.  His EKG
   does not show evidence of new ischemia and he denies chest pain. Not
   responsive to fluid bolus.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - Continue norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
 attempt to wean
   - Watch for dizziness and scintillation (previous phenomenological
   markers of hypotension)
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Current Cr 4.2, baseline Cr 2.5-2.9. Current poor perfusion and amyloid
   disease, previous likely hypertensive and hyperglycemia injury also, or
   also plasma cell dyscrasia. Discussing dialysis.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - Contact renal for assistance with spinning urine and recommendations
   (but will discuss goals with family and patient first
 daughter is
   coming in today)
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   - Check urine/cr ratio, urine lytes, osms, consider 24 hr urine.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike. Given very poor
   prognosis with respect to hemodynamics and renal failure, will hold off
   on contacting [**Name (NI) **]/Onc regarding possibility of inpatient BM biopsy, at
   least until HD and renal failure clear.
   - Have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   will continue to discuss
   # Atrial fibrillation and sinus pause/block
   Paroxysmal AF and block, likely secondary to infiltrated myocardium and
   conduction system. Meets criteria for PPM, but we really need to
   address big picture, ie. HD stability first
 refractory hypotension
   now on pressors. CHADS score is [**11-25**] depending on whether age ought to
   be counted.  Given his multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly
   that benefits outweigh risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure
   Likely secondary to amyloid infiltration. Would benefit from diuresis,
   but he has been unable to tolerate significant diuresis during recent
   hospital stay.  Will manage volume as needed to support his blood
   pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 28.3
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin
   # FEN:  regular diet
   # ACCESS: PIV and midline; if unable to wean pressors, would need
   central access
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with subQ heparin
   -Pain management with tylenol prn

   EKG [**2-21**] at 13:14:  AFib with rate of 64.  LAD.  Q waves across the
   precordium suggestive of prior inferior and anterior MI.  III and aVF
   have questionable Q waves (looks like there is an upward deflection
   first) suggestive of prior IMI.  Prior EKGs from [**2-6**] and [**2-11**]
   demonstrate that he alternated between sinus rhythm with LAFB and AFib
   without rapid response.
   TELEMETRY:  AFib with rate in 90s
   2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM [**2120-1-29**]:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure
   is 10-20mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%).
   Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
   motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
   but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within
   normal limits). There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a very small pericardial effusion. There
   is a large left pleural effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2120-1-28**],
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension and increased
   PCWP are now identified. A large left pleural effusion is also
   now seen.
   Dobutamine Stress Echo [**2119-10-30**]:
   This 74 year old man with a h/o CHF was referred to the lab for
   evaluation of dyspnea and chest discomfort. The patient was
   administered 15, 30, and 45 mcg/kg/min of Dobutamine IV for a total of
   7.5 minutes. At peak infusion, the patient did note an ""ache"" in his
   chest. This discomfort resolved with 15 mg of Esmolol given IV post
   infusion. Baseline EKG shows non-specific STTWs inferiorly and V5-6. At
   peak infusion, there was 0.[**Street Address(2) 14321**] depression in these same leads.
   The rhythm was sinus with increasing atrial and ventricular ectopy
   including isolated APBs, VPBs, and couplets. Also, a 7 beat run of SVT
   and a 4 beat run of polymorphic VT were noted. The hemodynamic response
   to the infusion was appropriate.
   IMPRESSION: Possible anginal symptoms with non-specific ECG changes at
   the acheived workload. Ventricular ectopy noted. Echo report sent
   separately.
   Echo:  Equivocal ECG changes in the absence of 2D echocardiographic
   evidence of inducible ischemia. Dilated right ventricle with preserved
   systolic function and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Hemodynamics (cath) [**2120-1-29**]:
   1. Resting hemodynamics revealed mildly elevated right and left sided
   filling pressures RVEDP 15mmHg and LVEDP 20mmHg.  There was no ""M"" sign
   seen on RA pressure tracing.  There was no ""Square-root sign"" seen on
   RV pressure tracing.  There was concordance with RV and LV pressure
   tracing signifying low liklihood of constriction.  There was moderate
   pulmonary arterial hypertension with PASP 57mmHg. The cardiac index was
   elevated at 3.6 l/min/m2, with a normal systemic vascular resistance
   (622 dynes*sec/cm5) while on levophed.
   2. Resting hemodynamics in the absence of levophed revealed an elevated
   cardiac index 4.2 l/min/m2 with an inappropriately low systemic
   vascular resistance.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction.
   2. Vasodilatory hypotension.
   3. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   4. Elevated cardiac output/index on and off of levophed.
   Soft tissue (abdominal wall fat), biopsy: Adipose tissue with
   features consistent with amyloid deposition.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Vasodilatory hypotension, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and organ perfusion.
	* Mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and increased filling pressures.
	* Moderate pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right ventricular failure and decreased cardiac output.
2. Renal complications:
	* Acute renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
	* Chronic kidney disease, which can lead to end-stage renal disease and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
3. Respiratory complications:
	* Respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
	* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which can lead to increased risk of respiratory failure and cardiovascular events.
4. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Amyloidosis, which can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation.
	* Chronic kidney disease, which can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
5. Neurological complications:
	* Amyloidosis, which can lead to neurological symptoms such as cognitive impairment, depression, and anxiety.
	* Chronic kidney disease, which can lead to neurological symptoms such as cognitive impairment, depression, and anxiety.
6. Infection complications:
	* Urinary tract infection (UTI), which can lead to sepsis and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
	* Bloodstream infection (BSI), which can lead to sepsis and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
7. Bleeding complications:
	* Amyloidosis, which can lead to bleeding complications such as epistaxis, hematuria, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
	* Chronic kidney disease, which can lead to bleeding complications such as epistaxis, hematuria, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Thrombotic complications:
	* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to pulmonary embolism and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
	* Pulmonary embolism, which can lead to respiratory failure and increased risk of cardiovascular events.

Based on the patient's medical history, the following are the potential medical complications that are most likely to arise:

1. Cardiac complications, such as vasodilatory hypotension, mild biventricular diastolic dysfunction, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
2. Renal complications, such as acute renal failure and chronic kidney disease.
3. Respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
4. Gastrointestinal complications, such as amyloidosis and chronic kidney disease.
5. Neurological complications, such as amyloidosis and chronic kidney disease.

It is important to note that the patient's medical history is complex, and the potential medical complications that can arise are numerous. Therefore, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension:
   Heart failure, intravascular depletion and tissue edema. Has been
   worsening on one pressor
 vasopressin 2.4 overnight. Attempted
   norepinephrine, but patient became tachycardic.
   - Augement peripheral pressors
 increase midodrine to 15 mg TID and
   start phenylephrine
 watch for signs of tachycardia and arrhythmia.
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Now intravascularly depleted while very volume overloaded. Failure
   worsens as patient has become anuric. Attributed to amyloid or plasma
   cell dyscrasia.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia:
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike.
   - have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible. In
   conjunction with family, goals may change today
   # Atrial fibrillation
   Has been intermittently in AF, as per previous admissions.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure:
   Is anuric and not a candidate for dialysis given prognosis.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 30

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 74-year-old gentleman, is a transfer from another hospital due to renal failure in the setting of heart failure. He has a poor prognosis due to cardiac and suspected renal involvement, as well as a possible plasma cell dyscrasia. He is currently in the ICU with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, and blood pressure of 67/38 mmHg. He has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and recently diagnosed amyloidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac condition and hypotension increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory failure may lead to respiratory arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of central lines increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and use of anticoagulants may lead to bleeding complications.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of central lines increase the risk of infection.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure, requiring dialysis or renal replacement therapy.
7. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and compromised cardiac function may lead to cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Stroke: The patient's cardiac condition and hypotension increase the risk of stroke.
9. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and respiratory failure may lead to respiratory arrest.
10. Multi-Organ Failure: The patient's compromised cardiac and renal function may lead to multi-organ failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension:
   Heart failure, intravascular depletion and tissue edema. Has been
   worsening on one pressor
 vasopressin 2.4 overnight. Attempted
   norepinephrine, but patient became tachycardic.
   - Augement peripheral pressors
 increase midodrine to 15 mg TID and
   start phenylephrine
 watch for signs of tachycardia and arrhythmia.
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease
   Now intravascularly depleted while very volume overloaded. Failure
   worsens as patient has become anuric. Attributed to amyloid or plasma
   cell dyscrasia.
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia:
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike.
   - have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible. In
   conjunction with family, goals may change today
   # Atrial fibrillation
   Has been intermittently in AF, as per previous admissions.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure:
   Is anuric and not a candidate for dialysis given prognosis.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 30

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and recently diagnosed amyloidosis. He was transferred to the ICU for renal failure and is currently hypotensive, with acute renal failure and volume overload. His condition has worsened overnight, and he has become anuric. The patient's prognosis is poor due to cardiac and suspected renal involvement, and there is a concern for possible plasma cell dyscrasia given the monoclonal Ig spike. The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI, and he is requesting palliative care and to return home with consideration of home hospice.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's heart failure and amyloidosis may lead to further cardiac deterioration, including arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease, leading to further fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of infections.
3. Infection risk: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central lines and tubes may increase his risk of infection.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's amyloidosis may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms, including constipation, nausea, and vomiting.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and heart failure may increase his risk of respiratory failure, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's amyloidosis may lead to neurological symptoms, including cognitive impairment, confusion, and seizures.
7. Hematological complications: The patient's plasma cell dyscrasia may lead to further hematological complications, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia.
8. Nutritional complications: The patient's decreased appetite and malnutrition may lead to further weight loss, muscle wasting, and decreased immune function.
9. Psychosocial complications: The patient's poor prognosis and decreased quality of life may lead to depression, anxiety, and decreased coping mechanisms.
10. Family and caregiver burden: The patient's family and caregivers may experience emotional distress, anxiety, and burnout due to the patient's complex medical condition and poor prognosis."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with acute renal failure, heart failure, and hypotension. The patient's condition has not improved, and the family has made the difficult decision to change the patient's code status to DNR/DNI, indicating that they do not wish to pursue aggressive life-sustaining measures.

The patient's vital signs are concerning, with a blood pressure of 67/38 mmHg and a heart rate of 63 bpm. The patient is also experiencing very low urine output, which is a sign of worsening renal failure.

The patient's lab results are also concerning, with a creatinine level of 5.2 mg/dL and a potassium level of 5.5 mEq/L. These values indicate severe kidney damage and electrolyte imbalance.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 95% and a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute. However, the patient's neurological status is unknown due to the lack of assessment.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including vasopressin, heparin, and dextrose. The patient is also receiving nutritional support and has a multi-lumen catheter in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's hypotension and low urine output increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's decreased lung function and respiratory rate increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's low white blood cell count and high lactate level increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's high potassium and low calcium levels increase the risk of electrolyte imbalance.
5. Renal failure progression: The patient's worsening renal function increases the risk of further kidney damage and potential need for dialysis.
6. Infection: The patient's lack of assessment and low white blood cell count increase the risk of infection.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and high lactate level increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

In light of the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, lab results, and clinical status to address any potential complications and provide supportive care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension:
   Felt to be due to autonomic dysfunction and inappropriate
   vasodilation.  Note that he often had episodes of hypotension with SBPs
   in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He endorses poor PO intake
   and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there may be a component of
   hypovolemia.  No fevers, leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an
   infection.  Cardiogenic shock unlikely unless he suffered new insult,
   and although his troponin is elevated, this is in the setting of
   worsening renal failure.  His EKG does not show evidence of new
   ischemia and he denies chest pain.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - wean norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease:  current Cr 4.2,
   baseline Cr 2.5-2.9:
   Likely due to poor renal perfusion in setting of hypotension
   superimposed on progressively worsening renal dysfunction that has been
   attributed to amyloid or plasma cell dyscrasia.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - will contact renal in AM for assistance with spinning urine
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia:
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike.
   - will contact [**Name (NI) **]/Onc in AM regarding possibility of inpatient BM
   biopsy
   - have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear upon review of discharge summary if
   team was aware that he had been in AFib during recent hospital stay.
   CHADS score is [**11-25**] depending on whether age ought to be counted.  Given
   his multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly that benefits outweigh
   risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure:
   Would benefit from diuresis, but he has been unable to tolerate
   significant diuresis during recent hospital stay.  Will manage volume
   as needed to support his blood pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 30
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 840**] is a 74yo gentleman with diastolic heart failure and chronic
   kidney disease in the setting of recently diagnosed amyloidosis who
   presents with hypotension, acute renal failure, and volume overload.
   # Hypotension:
   Felt to be due to autonomic dysfunction and inappropriate
   vasodilation.  Note that he often had episodes of hypotension with SBPs
   in the 60s during his recent hospital stay.  He endorses poor PO intake
   and he is very thirsty, suggesting that there may be a component of
   hypovolemia.  No fevers, leukocytosis, or symptoms to suggest an
   infection.  Cardiogenic shock unlikely unless he suffered new insult,
   and although his troponin is elevated, this is in the setting of
   worsening renal failure.  His EKG does not show evidence of new
   ischemia and he denies chest pain.
   - judicious IVF boluses as needed with the understanding that he third
   spaces most of the fluid given to him
   - wean norepinephrine gtt as tolerated
   - f/u urine and blood cultures; no indications for antibiotics at this
   time
   - monitor mental status and urine output
   - will follow serial cardiac biomarkers
   - monitor on tele
   # Acute renal failure on chronic kidney disease:  current Cr 4.2,
   baseline Cr 2.5-2.9:
   Likely due to poor renal perfusion in setting of hypotension
   superimposed on progressively worsening renal dysfunction that has been
   attributed to amyloid or plasma cell dyscrasia.
   - again, would be judicious with IV fluids as he may well have ATN from
   his hypotension and this would not correct immediately with volume
   resuscitation
   - will contact renal in AM for assistance with spinning urine
   - monitor chem 10 [**Hospital1 7**] to TID
   - avoid renally toxic agents
   # Amyloid and concern for Plasma cell dyscrasia:
   Per discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 14319**], patient has poor prognosis due to both
   cardiac and suspected renal involvement.  Also suspicious for possible
   plasma cell dyscrasia given monoclonal Ig spike.
   - will contact [**Name (NI) **]/Onc in AM regarding possibility of inpatient BM
   biopsy
   - have discussed poor prognosis with patient; at this time, he is
   asking that he be treated to ""keep him around"" as much as possible
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Unclear upon review of discharge summary if
   team was aware that he had been in AFib during recent hospital stay.
   CHADS score is [**11-25**] depending on whether age ought to be counted.  Given
   his multiple comorbidities, do not feel strongly that benefits outweigh
   risks for anticoagulation.
   - monitor rate
   - continue ASA
   # Chronic Diastolic heart failure:
   Would benefit from diuresis, but he has been unable to tolerate
   significant diuresis during recent hospital stay.  Will manage volume
   as needed to support his blood pressure as discussed above.
   # COPD:  continue nebs
   # h/o alcohol abuse:  continue MVI, thiamine, folate
   # Iron deficiency anemia:   baseline hct 25-29, current Hct 30
   - monitor
   # Dyslipidemia:
   Not on his PMH and LDL 44 with HDL of 21 when checked this month.
   - will stop statin

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with diastolic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and recently diagnosed amyloidosis. He was transferred to the ICU due to worsening renal failure, hypotension, and volume overload. He has a poor prognosis due to cardiac and suspected renal involvement, and is also suspicious for possible plasma cell dyscrasia given a monoclonal Ig spike. He is currently on vasopressin and norepinephrine, and has been weaned off norepinephrine. His vital signs are stable, but he has a history of poor PO intake and is very thirsty, suggesting possible hypovolemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's current Cr of 4.2 is likely due to poor renal perfusion in the setting of hypotension, and may worsen if not managed properly.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's diastolic heart failure and suspected cardiac involvement may lead to further cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and poor PO intake make him susceptible to infections, which could worsen his condition.
4. Volume Overload: The patient's volume overload may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further cardiac complications and respiratory distress.
5. Autonomic Dysfunction: The patient's autonomic dysfunction may lead to further hypotension and cardiac complications.
6. Plasma Cell Dyscrasia: The patient's suspicion of plasma cell dyscrasia may lead to further complications, such as anemia, bleeding, or infection.
7. Amyloidosis: The patient's amyloidosis may lead to further complications, such as cardiac involvement, kidney failure, or respiratory distress.
8. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's history of poor PO intake and hypovolemia may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which could worsen his condition.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust fluid management accordingly.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's electrolytes and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Consider consulting with a nephrologist or oncologist to further manage the patient's condition.
5. Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further complications.
6. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to further manage the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 34.5°C (94.1°F)
* Heart rate: 106 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 53/27 mmHg (hypotensive)
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 92%
* Atrial fibrillation (AF) is present

The patient is receiving various medications, including vasopressin, morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, hydromorphone, and dextrose 50%. They are also receiving fluid therapy and have a total fluid balance of 656 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Hemoglobin: 8.4 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.1-7.3 K/uL
* Platelet count: 208-287 K/uL
* Creatinine: 4.3-6.1 mg/dL (indicating acute renal failure)
* Troponin-T: 0.44-0.50 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 8.9 mg/dL

The patient has a diagnosis of:

* Hypoglycemia
* Renal failure, acute
* Hypotension (not shock)
* Atrial fibrillation

The patient is at risk for potential medical complications, including:

* Sepsis
* Multi-organ dysfunction
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Infections (e.g., ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-related bloodstream infections)
* Renal failure progression
* Neurological complications (e.g., seizures, stroke)

The patient's care plan should focus on:

* Tight glycemic control
* Aggressive fluid management
* Optimization of cardiovascular status
* Prevention of infections
* Monitoring of renal function and electrolyte balance
* Close observation for signs of sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction
* Consideration of cardiovascular support measures (e.g., vasopressors, inotropes)"
