   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Likely hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure, worsening LFT
   abnormalities and narcotics in setting of poor substrate and poor
   reserve leading to deficits as noted and exacerbation of old CVA
   deficits.
   Other likely contributors contributors:
   - toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances (in setting of
   acute renal failure and worsening LFTs)
   - left lower lobe infiltrate, likely aspiration
   Les likely contributors:
   - CVA or TIA,  (CT head prelim neg)
   - infection of indwelling port, urine (UA bland), CNS (no consistent
   symptoms)
   - seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain metastases
   - intracranial hemorrhage/mass effect/edema (no evidence on CT scan)
   Plan:
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes for no
   invasive procedures
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   - Touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] or covering neuro oncologist
   - transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction..
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - No schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS
   - Urine eos neg
   - bolus fluid/blood prn UOP
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or
   systolic <85, or if symptomatic. EF most recently 50% and satting 100%
   allowing for aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED).
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate [**Last Name (LF) 7676**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] repeat today to
   goal 30
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
    TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and benadryl prn (taken without worsened MS)
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with morphine IV prn, avoid oxycodone due to
   pruritis
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed. Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed,
   wait for INR to trend downward.
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 at 100 cc/hr overnight, bolus for hypotension,
   monitoring and repleting electrolytes aggressively. Sips until mental
   status improves.
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Consult placed, PO diet once more stable.

   hydration
   - No schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS
   - Urine eos neg
   - bolus fluid/blood prn UOP
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or
   systolic <85, or if symptomatic. EF most recently 50% and satting 100%
   allowing for aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED).
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate [**Last Name (LF) 7676**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] repeat today to
   goal 30
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
    TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and benadryl prn (taken without worsened MS)
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with morphine IV prn, avoid oxycodone due to
   pruritis
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed. Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed,
   wait for INR to trend downward.
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Differential includes CVA or TIA,
   toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances (in setting of
   acute renal failure) or infection (potential sources include lung with
   possible aspiration given decreased mental status over last few days,
   indwelling port, urinary infection, CNS though story is less convincing
   for this), seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain
   metastases, intracranial hemorrhage. Suspect that some degree is likely
   from poor perfusion in setting of hypovolemia and hypotension. Recent
   use of oxycodone could also be contributing to depressed mental status.
   To pull together the story, suspect this is a case of hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure and narcotics in
   setting of poor substrate and poor reserve leading to deficits as noted
   and exacerbation of old CVA deficits.
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Consider neurology consult in AM if mental status not improved with
   above interventions, would also consider additional imaging such as MRI
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility. In setting of thromcytopenia, anemia, and altered mental
   status, TTP/HUS is also a possibility, but no schistocytes or rise in
   T. Bili. She has no known metastates in the pelvis that would account
   for obstruction.
   - Urine electrolytes being sent
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - Repeat peripheral smear in AM to again check for schistocytes
   - Checking urine eosinophils
   - Currently making fairly good urine, will continue to monitor output
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy.
   - Continue IVF boluses as needed for low urine output or systolic <85,
   or if symptomatic, however will use D5 with three amps of bicarb given
   metabolic acidosis (likely secondary to renal failure), and will need
   to be mindful of her cardiomyopathy.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelet could of 68 on presentation. She is day
   18 of her gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow
   suppression from that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up
   secondary to administration of GSC-F). Baseline prior to this appears
   to vary, likely secondary to cycles of chemotherapy (75-400's). TTP/HUS
   is consideration as noted above, but no schistocytes, T. Bili is
   normal, no fevers.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED). Will also rule out hemolysis by checking laboratories, however
   no schistocytes on smear noted.
   - Hemolysis labs, reticulocyte count
   - Type and cross, repeat HCT now and likely transfuse two units of
   PRBCs
   - Checking B12, folate, iron (MCV is 109), as suspect poor nutrition
   intake of these
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Differential includes
   secondary to uremia from renal dysfunction, medication effect (pruritis
   started around same time as she started oxycodone, and reported
   incidence of pruritis is up to 12-13%), worsening liver disease (she
   has known metastases).
   - Checking LFT's, renal failure management as noted above
   - Checking TSH, ferritin
   - Sarna PRN, holding off on benadryl or atarax as these may cloud
   assessment of mental status
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Unclear etiology. Patient currently unable to
   give further details. In setting of possible urinary retention, cauda
   equina syndrome is a consideration, but patient currently without
   sensory deficits with normal rectal tone and discomfort with rectal
   thermometer. Response to oxycodone also is less consistent with cord
   compression. She has known bony metastases of her pelvis and spine, so
   these could also be causing pain (eg via nerve impingement or
   pathologic fracture)
   - Start with plain films to rule out compression fracture and/or
   pelvis/hip fracture
   - Consider further imaging of spine in AM if/once patient is more
   stable
   - Should she develop new deficits, would consider initiation of
   steroids for question of cord compression
   - Continue oxycodone for pain control
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed. Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed,
   wait for INR to trend downward.
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 at 100 cc/hr overnight, bolus for hypotension,
   monitoring and repleting electrolytes aggressively. Sips until mental
   status improves.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Differential includes CVA or TIA,
   toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances (in setting of
   acute renal failure) or infection (potential sources include lung with
   possible aspiration given decreased mental status over last few days,
   indwelling port, urinary infection, CNS though story is less convincing
   for this), seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain
   metastases, intracranial hemorrhage. Suspect that some degree is likely
   from poor perfusion in setting of hypovolemia and hypotension. Recent
   use of oxycodone could also be contributing to depressed mental status.
   To pull together the story, suspect this is a case of hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure and narcotics in
   setting of poor substrate and poor reserve leading to deficits as noted
   and exacerbation of old CVA deficits.
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Consider neurology consult in AM if mental status not improved with
   above interventions, would also consider additional imaging such as MRI
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility. In setting of thromcytopenia, anemia, and altered mental
   status, TTP/HUS is also a possibility, but no schistocytes or rise in
   T. Bili. She has no known metastates in the pelvis that would account
   for obstruction.
   - Urine electrolytes being sent
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - Repeat peripheral smear in AM to again check for schistocytes
   - Checking urine eosinophils
   - Currently making fairly good urine, will continue to monitor output
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy.
   - Continue IVF boluses as needed for low urine output or systolic <85,
   or if symptomatic, however will use D5 with three amps of bicarb given
   metabolic acidosis (likely secondary to renal failure), and will need
   to be mindful of her cardiomyopathy.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelet could of 68 on presentation. She is day
   18 of her gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow
   suppression from that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up
   secondary to administration of GSC-F). Baseline prior to this appears
   to vary, likely secondary to cycles of chemotherapy (75-400's). TTP/HUS
   is consideration as noted above, but no schistocytes, T. Bili is
   normal, no fevers.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED). Will also rule out hemolysis by checking laboratories, however
   no schistocytes on smear noted.
   - Hemolysis labs, reticulocyte count
   - Type and cross, repeat HCT now and likely transfuse two units of
   PRBCs
   - Checking B12, folate, iron (MCV is 109), as suspect poor nutrition
   intake of these
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Differential includes
   secondary to uremia from renal dysfunction, medication effect (pruritis
   started around same time as she started oxycodone, and reported
   incidence of pruritis is up to 12-13%), worsening liver disease (she
   has known metastases).
   - Checking LFT's, renal failure management as noted above
   - Checking TSH, ferritin
   - Sarna PRN, holding off on benadryl or atarax as these may cloud
   assessment of mental status
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Unclear etiology. Patient currently unable to
   give further details. In setting of possible urinary retention, cauda
   equina syndrome is a consideration, but patient currently without
   sensory deficits with normal rectal tone and discomfort with rectal
   thermometer. Response to oxycodone also is less consistent with cord
   compression. She has known bony metastases of her pelvis and spine, so
   these could also be causing pain (eg via nerve impingement or
   pathologic fracture)
   - Start with plain films to rule out compression fracture and/or
   pelvis/hip fracture
   - Consider further imaging of spine in AM if/once patient is more
   stable
   - Should she develop new deficits, would consider initiation of
   steroids for question of cord compression
   - Continue oxycodone for pain control
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed. Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed,
   wait for INR to trend downward.
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 at 100 cc/hr overnight, bolus for hypotension,
   monitoring and repleting electrolytes aggressively. Sips until mental
   status improves.
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Consult placed, PO diet once more stable.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 74-year-old female with a past medical history of metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA, and cardiomyopathy, presents with altered mental status.

The patient's current condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is confused and disoriented, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 10/15. The differential diagnosis includes CVA or TIA, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, seizures, and intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure. The etiology is unclear, but possibilities include pre-renal azotemia, post-obstructive nephropathy, and TTP/HUS.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 68, which may be due to marrow suppression from chemotherapy or TTP/HUS.
4. Anemia: The patient has a hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL, which may be due to marrow suppression, bleeding, or hemolysis.
5. Pruritis: The patient has been experiencing pruritis, which may be due to uremia, medication effect, or worsening liver disease.
6. Breast Cancer: The patient has metastatic breast cancer, which is being treated with chemotherapy.
7. Failure to Thrive: The patient has lost weight and has poor PO intake, which may be due to chemotherapy, depression, or other factors.
8. Bilateral Leg Pain: The patient has bilateral leg pain, which may be due to urinary retention, cauda equina syndrome, or bony metastases.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and decreased urine output may indicate sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's decreased lung function and respiratory rate may indicate respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiomyopathy and hypotension may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppression and altered mental status may increase the risk of infection.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Fluid management: The patient will receive IV fluids to treat hypovolemia and hypotension.
2. Antibiotics: The patient will receive antibiotics to treat potential infections.
3. Pain management: The patient will receive oxycodone and tylenol for pain management.
4. Nutrition: The patient will receive nutrition consult to improve PO intake.
5. Renal failure management: The patient will receive hemodialysis if necessary.
6. Thrombocytopenia management: The patient will receive platelet transfusions if necessary.
7. Anemia management: The patient will receive blood transfusions if necessary.
8. Pruritis management: The patient will receive sarna PRN for pruritis management.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Likely hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure, worsening LFT
   abnormalities and narcotics in setting of poor substrate and poor
   reserve leading to deficits as noted and exacerbation of old CVA
   deficits.
   Other likely contributors contributors:
   - toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances (in setting of
   acute renal failure and worsening LFTs)
   - left lower lobe infiltrate, likely aspiration
   Les likely contributors:
   - CVA or TIA,  (CT head prelim neg)
   - infection of indwelling port, urine (UA bland), CNS (no consistent
   symptoms)
   - seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain metastases
   - intracranial hemorrhage/mass effect/edema (no evidence on CT scan)
   Plan:
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes for no
   invasive procedures
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   - Touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] or covering neuro oncologist
   - transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction..
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - No schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS
   - Urine eos neg
   - bolus fluid/blood prn UOP
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or
   systolic <85, or if symptomatic. EF most recently 50% and satting 100%
   allowing for aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED).
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate [**Last Name (LF) 7676**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] repeat today to
   goal 30
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and benadryl prn (taken without worsened MS)
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with morphine IV prn, avoid oxycodone due to
   pruritis
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed.
   - Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 maintenance while NPO
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Likely hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure, worsening LFT
   abnormalities and narcotics in setting of poor substrate and poor
   reserve leading to deficits as noted and exacerbation of old CVA
   deficits.
   Other likely contributors contributors:
   - toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances (in setting of
   acute renal failure and worsening LFTs)
   - left lower lobe infiltrate, likely aspiration
   Les likely contributors:
   - CVA or TIA,  (CT head prelim neg)
   - infection of indwelling port, urine (UA bland), CNS (no consistent
   symptoms)
   - seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain metastases
   - intracranial hemorrhage/mass effect/edema (no evidence on CT scan)
   Plan:
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes for no
   invasive procedures
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   - Touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] or covering neuro oncologist
   - transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30

   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to

Summary:

Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74-year-old female with a past medical history of metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA, and cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status. She has been experiencing agitation, screaming, and pulling at clothes and lines, which has responded to pain medication. She has also been experiencing pruritis, bilateral leg pain, and failure to thrive.

Assessment:

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hypoperfusion and toxic/metabolic encephalopathy secondary to renal failure, worsening LFT abnormalities, and narcotics in the setting of poor substrate and poor reserve. Other possible contributors include toxic/metabolic effects of electrolyte disturbances, left lower lobe infiltrate, and CVA or TIA.

Plan:

* Hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis and await culture data.
* Follow up electrolytes and consider checking renal ultrasound if not improving after hydration.
* Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for MAP >55-60.
* Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy.
* Transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30.
* Consider checking for schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS.
* Monitor for signs of bleeding and transfuse should count be <20K or have symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine is elevated, and she has a history of DVT and cardiomyopathy, which may be contributing to her renal failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she has a history of cardiomyopathy, which may be contributing to her hypotension.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be due to marrow suppression from chemotherapy.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which may be due to marrow suppression from chemotherapy or blood loss.
5. Pruritis: The patient's pruritis may be due to oxycodone or uremia.
6. Bilateral leg pain: The patient's bilateral leg pain may be due to compression by known spinal mets.
7. Failure to thrive: The patient's failure to thrive may be due to poor PO intake and lack of nutrition.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluids and electrolytes as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust IVF and pressors as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin level and transfuse if necessary.
5. Consider checking for schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS.
6. Monitor the patient's pruritis and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Consider consulting with a nutritionist to develop a plan for the patient's nutritional needs.
8. Consider consulting with a pain management specialist to develop a plan for the patient's pain management."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Differential includes CVA or TIA,
   toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances (in setting of
   acute renal failure) or infection (potential sources include lung with
   possible aspiration given decreased mental status over last few days,
   indwelling port, urinary infection, CNS though story is less convincing
   for this), seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain
   metastases, intracranial hemorrhage. Suspect that some degree is likely
   from poor perfusion in setting of hypovolemia and hypotension. Recent
   use of oxycodone could also be contributing to depressed mental status.
   To pull together the story, suspect this is a case of hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure and narcotics in
   setting of poor substrate and poor reserve leading to deficits as noted
   and exacerbation of old CVA deficits.
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Consider neurology consult in AM if mental status not improved with
   above interventions, would also consider additional imaging such as MRI
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction.. In setting of thromcytopenia, anemia,
   and altered mental status, TTP/HUS is also a possibility, but no
   schistocytes or rise in T. Bili.
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - Repeat peripheral smear in AM to again check for schistocytes
   - Urine eos neg
   - Currently making fairly good urine, will continue to monitor output
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue IVF boluses as needed for low urine output or systolic <85,
   or if symptomatic, however will use D5 with three amps of bicarb given
   metabolic acidosis (likely secondary to renal failure), and will need
   to be mindful of her cardiomyopathy.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Baseline prior to this appears to vary,
   likely secondary to cycles of chemotherapy (75-400's). TTP/HUS is
   consideration as noted above, but no schistocytes, T. Bili is normal,
   no fevers.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED). Will also rule out hemolysis by checking laboratories, however
   no schistocytes on smear noted.
   - Hemolysis labs
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate bump.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Differential includes
   secondary to uremia from renal dysfunction, medication effect (pruritis
   started around same time as she started oxycodone, and reported
   incidence of pruritis is up to 12-13%), worsening liver disease (she
   has known metastases).
   - Checking LFT's, renal failure management as noted above
   - Checking TSH, ferritin
   - Sarna PRN, holding off on benadryl or atarax as these may cloud
   assessment of mental status
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Unclear etiology. Patient currently unable to
   give further details. In setting of possible urinary retention, cauda
   equina syndrome is a consideration, but patient currently without
   sensory deficits with normal rectal tone and discomfort with rectal
   thermometer. Response to oxycodone also is less consistent with cord
   compression. She has known bony metastases of her pelvis and spine, so
   these could also be causing pain (eg via nerve impingement or
   pathologic fracture)
   - Start with plain films to rule out compression fracture and/or
   pelvis/hip fracture
   - Consider further imaging of spine in AM if/once patient is more
   stable
   - Should she develop new deficits, would consider initiation of
   steroids for question of cord compression
   - Continue oxycodone for pain control
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed. Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed,
   wait for INR to trend downward.
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 at 100 cc/hr overnight, bolus for hypotension,
   monitoring and repleting electrolytes aggressively. Sips until mental
   status improves.
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Consult placed, PO diet once more stable.

   indwelling port, urinary infection, CNS though story is less convincing
   for this), seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain
   metastases, intracranial hemorrhage. Suspect that some degree is likely
   from poor perfusion in setting of hypovolemia and hypotension. Recent
   use of oxycodone could also be contributing to depressed mental status.
   To pull together the story, suspect this is a case of hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure and narcotics in
   setting of poor substrate and poor reserve leading to deficits as noted
   and exacerbation of old CVA deficits.
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Consider neurology consult in AM if mental status not improved with
   above interventions, would also consider additional imaging such as MRI
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction.. In setting of thromcytopenia, anemia,
   and altered mental status, TTP/HUS is also a possibility, but no
   schistocytes or rise in T. Bili.
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - Repeat peripheral smear in AM to again check for schistocytes
   - Urine eos neg
   - Currently making fairly good urine, will continue to monitor output
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue IVF boluses as needed for low urine output or systolic <85,
   or if symptomatic, however will use D5 with three amps of bicarb given
   metabolic acidosis (likely secondary to renal failure), and will need
   to be mindful of her cardiomyopathy.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Baseline prior to this appears to vary,
   likely secondary to cycles of chemotherapy (75-400's). TTP/HUS is
   consideration as noted above, but no schistocytes, T. Bili is normal,
   no fevers.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED). Will also rule out hemolysis by checking laboratories, however
   no schistocytes on smear noted.
   - Hemolysis labs
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate bump.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Differential includes
   secondary to uremia from renal dysfunction, medication effect (pruritis
   started around same time as she started oxycodone, and reported
   incidence of pruritis is up to 12-13%), worsening liver disease (she
   has known metastases).
   - Checking LFT's, renal failure management as noted above
   - Checking TSH, ferritin
   - Sarna PRN, holding off on benadryl or atarax as these may cloud
   assessment of mental status
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Unclear etiology. Patient currently unable to
   give further details. In setting of possible urinary retention, cauda
   equina syndrome is a consideration, but patient currently without
   sensory deficits with normal rectal tone and discomfort with rectal
   thermometer. Response to oxycodone also is less consistent with cord
   compression. She has known bony metastases of her pelvis and spine, so
   these could also be causing pain (eg via nerve impingement or
   pathologic fracture)
   - Start with plain films to rule out compression fracture and/or
   pelvis/hip fracture
   - Consider further imaging of spine in AM if/once patient is more
   stable
   - Should she develop new deficits, would consider initiation of
   steroids for question of cord compression
   - Continue oxycodone for pain control
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed. Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed,
   wait for INR to trend downward.
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 at 100 cc/hr overnight, bolus for hypotension,
   monitoring and repleting electrolytes aggressively. Sips until mental
   status improves.
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Consult placed, PO diet once more stable.

Summary:

Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74-year-old female with a past medical history of metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA, and cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status, weakness, and bilateral leg pain. She has a history of poor PO intake, and her husband reports a significant weight loss over the past several months. Her laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure, which may be secondary to chemotherapy, poor perfusion, and hypovolemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hypoperfusion, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, or infection. The differential diagnosis includes CVA or TIA, toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances, infection, seizures, and intracranial hemorrhage.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may be secondary to pre-renal, post-renal, or intrinsic renal failure. The differential diagnosis includes TTP/HUS, which is less likely given the normal T. Bili and absence of schistocytes.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be secondary to marrow suppression from chemotherapy or TTP/HUS. The differential diagnosis includes hemolysis, which is less likely given the normal reticulocytosis and absence of schistocytes.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be secondary to marrow suppression from chemotherapy, hemolysis, or chronic disease.
5. Pruritis: The patient's pruritis may be secondary to uremia, medication effect, or worsening liver disease.
6. Bilateral Leg Pain: The patient's bilateral leg pain may be secondary to bony metastases, cauda equina syndrome, or nerve impingement.
7. DVT: The patient's history of DVT may be contributing to her hypotension and elevated INR.
8. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's cardiomyopathy may be exacerbating her hypotension and requiring careful monitoring of IVF intake.
9. Failure to Thrive: The patient's failure to thrive may be secondary to poor PO intake, anemia, and chronic disease.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient will be closely monitored for signs of bleeding, and her platelet count will be checked regularly. She will be given lactulose for potential hepatic encephalopathy, and her electrolytes will be checked regularly. She will be given IVF boluses as needed for low urine output or systolic <85, and her blood pressure will be monitored closely. She will be given pain management with oxycodone and tylenol, and her bilateral leg pain will be further evaluated with plain films to rule out compression fracture and/or pelvis/hip fracture. She will be given a nutrition consult to improve her PO intake, and her husband will be educated on her condition and treatment plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Likely hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure, worsening LFT
   abnormalities and narcotics in setting of poor substrate and poor
   reserve leading to deficits as noted and exacerbation of old CVA
   deficits.
   Other likely contributors contributors:
   - toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances (in setting of
   acute renal failure and worsening LFTs)
   - left lower lobe infiltrate, likely aspiration
   Les likely contributors:
   - CVA or TIA,  (CT head prelim neg)
   - infection of indwelling port, urine (UA bland), CNS (no consistent
   symptoms)
   - seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain metastases
   - intracranial hemorrhage/mass effect/edema (no evidence on CT scan)
   Plan:
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes for no
   invasive procedures
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   - Touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] or covering neuro oncologist
   - transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction..
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - No schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS
   - Urine eos neg
   - bolus fluid/blood prn UOP
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or
   systolic <85, or if symptomatic. EF most recently 50% and satting 100%
   allowing for aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED).
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate [**Last Name (LF) 7676**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] repeat today to
   goal 30
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and benadryl prn (taken without worsened MS)
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with morphine IV prn, avoid oxycodone due to
   pruritis
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .

   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed.
   - Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Likely hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure, worsening LFT
   abnormalities and narcotics in setting of poor substrate and poor
   reserve leading to deficits as noted and exacerbation of old CVA
   deficits.
   Other likely contributors contributors:
   - toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances (in setting of
   acute renal failure and worsening LFTs)
   - left lower lobe infiltrate, likely aspiration
   Les likely contributors:
   - CVA or TIA,  (CT head prelim neg)
   - infection of indwelling port, urine (UA bland), CNS (no consistent
   symptoms)
   - seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain metastases
   - intracranial hemorrhage/mass effect/edema (no evidence on CT scan)
   Plan:
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes for no
   invasive procedures
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   - Touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] or covering neuro oncologist
   - transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction..
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - No schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS
   - Urine eos neg
   - bolus fluid/blood prn UOP
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or
   systolic <85, or if symptomatic. EF most recently 50% and satting 100%
   allowing for aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED).
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate [**Last Name (LF) 7676**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] repeat today to
   goal 30
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and benadryl prn (taken without worsened MS)
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with morphine IV prn, avoid oxycodone due to
   pruritis
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed.
   - Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 maintenance while NPO
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Consult placed, PO diet once more stable.

Summary:

Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**], a 74-year-old female with a past medical history of metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA, and cardiomyopathy, presents with altered mental status, weakness, and hypotension. She has a history of poor PO intake, and her baseline creatinine is 0.5. She has received 1U of pRBCs and 500cc of D5HCO3 for low urine output and hypotension. Her labs show elevated BUN, creatinine, and LFTs, and she has a platelet count of 68.

Assessment:

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hypoperfusion and toxic/metabolic encephalopathy secondary to renal failure, worsening LFT abnormalities, and narcotics in the setting of poor substrate and poor reserve. Other potential contributors include toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances, left lower lobe infiltrate, and seizures with post-ictal state.

Plan:

1. Hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis due to no true signs of meningismus on exam, no fevers, and history not consistent with this.
2. Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine).
3. Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure.
4. Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or days to assess for evolving process.
5. Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for MAP >55-60.
6. No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, and husband's wishes for no invasive procedures.
7. Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases).
8. Transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, which may be pre-renal, post-obstructive, or intrinsic.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 68, which may be due to marrow suppression from chemotherapy.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be due to marrow suppression secondary to chemotherapy, and poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease may account for macrocytosis and microcytosis, respectively.
4. Bilateral leg pain: The patient's bilateral leg pain may be due to compression by known spinal mets.
5. Failure to thrive: The patient has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last several months, and has very poor PO intake.
6. History of DVT: The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and she has a history of DVT on coumadin.
7. History of cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy, and is holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in setting of hypotension.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management accordingly.
2. Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse if necessary.
3. Continue to manage the patient's pain with oxycodone, tylenol, and morphine IV prn.
4. Consider imaging studies to evaluate the patient's bilateral leg pain and potential spinal mets.
5. Further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM.
6. Consider nutrition consult and NPO diet once more stable.
7. Monitor the patient's INR and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust therapy accordingly."

   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes for no
   invasive procedures
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   - Touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] or covering neuro oncologist
   - transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction..
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - No schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS
   - Urine eos neg
   - bolus fluid/blood prn UOP
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or
   systolic <85, or if symptomatic. EF most recently 50% and satting 100%
   allowing for aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED).
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate [**Last Name (LF) 7676**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] repeat today to
   goal 30
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and benadryl prn (taken without worsened MS)
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with morphine IV prn, avoid oxycodone due to
   pruritis
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed.
   - Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 maintenance while NPO
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Likely hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure, worsening LFT
   abnormalities and narcotics in setting of poor substrate and poor
   reserve leading to deficits as noted and exacerbation of old CVA
   deficits.
   Other likely contributors contributors:
   - toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances (in setting of
   acute renal failure and worsening LFTs)
   - left lower lobe infiltrate, likely aspiration
   Les likely contributors:
   - CVA or TIA,  (CT head prelim neg)
   - infection of indwelling port, urine (UA bland), CNS (no consistent
   symptoms)
   - seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain metastases
   - intracranial hemorrhage/mass effect/edema (no evidence on CT scan)
   Plan:
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes for no
   invasive procedures
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   - Touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] or covering neuro oncologist
   - transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction..
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - No schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS
   - Urine eos neg
   - bolus fluid/blood prn UOP
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or
   systolic <85, or if symptomatic. EF most recently 50% and satting 100%
   allowing for aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED).
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate [**Last Name (LF) 7676**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] repeat today to
   goal 30
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and benadryl prn (taken without worsened MS)
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with morphine IV prn, avoid oxycodone due to
   pruritis
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed.
   - Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 maintenance while NPO
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 74-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer, DVT, prior CVA, and cardiomyopathy, is experiencing several medical complications. The patient's condition is as follows:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is likely experiencing hypoperfusion and toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure, worsening LFT abnormalities, and narcotics in the setting of poor substrate and poor reserve. Other possible contributors include toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances, left lower lobe infiltrate, and CVA or TIA.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated BUN and creatinine, and the differential diagnosis includes pre-renal azotemia, post-obstructive etiology, and TTPHUS. The patient is receiving hydration and may require further evaluation with a renal ultrasound.
3. Hypotension: The patient's baseline blood pressure is 80-90/50, and she has received three liters of IVF to improve her blood pressure. The patient may have low baseline blood pressure due to cardiomyopathy, and she is receiving D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or systolic <85.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 68, which is consistent with marrow suppression from her recent chemotherapy cycle. The patient is being monitored for signs of bleeding and will receive transfusions if her count is <20K or she has symptoms.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to marrow suppression from chemotherapy, and she is receiving transfusions to maintain a HCT >30.
6. Pruritis: The patient's pruritis is likely due to oxycodone, and she is receiving Sarna and Benadryl as needed.
7. Bilateral Leg Pain: The patient's pain is likely due to compression by known spinal mets, and she is receiving morphine IV as needed.
8. Breast Cancer: The patient's breast cancer is being managed with different treatment, and she will require further discussion with her primary oncology team.
9. Failure to Thrive: The patient has lost significant weight and has poor PO intake, and a nutrition consult has been placed.
10. History of DVT: The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, and she is being held on coumadin. She will require further evaluation and management.

The patient's current medications include:

* Levofloxacin
* Famotidine (Pepcid)
* Morphine Sulfate
* Metoprolol
* Haloperidol (Haldol)
* Lactulose
* D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed
* Sarna and Benadryl as needed
* Morphine IV as needed

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Holding antibiotics for bacterial meningitis
* Following up on culture data
* Following up on electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
* Following up on final head CT read
* Supporting blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors
* Transfusing another unit of PRBCs to maintain a HCT >30
* Monitoring for signs of bleeding and transfusing as needed
* Managing pruritis with Sarna and Benadryl
* Managing bilateral leg pain with morphine IV
* Discussing breast cancer treatment with primary oncology team
* Managing failure to thrive with nutrition consult and PO diet once more stable
* Managing history of DVT with coumadin and pneumoboot to left leg

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is not to receive invasive procedures unless they would have a palliative effect."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Likely hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure, worsening LFT
   abnormalities and narcotics in setting of poor substrate and poor
   reserve leading to deficits as noted and exacerbation of old CVA
   deficits.
   Other likely contributors contributors:
   - toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances (in setting of
   acute renal failure and worsening LFTs)
   - left lower lobe infiltrate, likely aspiration
   Les likely contributors:
   - CVA or TIA,  (CT head prelim neg)
   - infection of indwelling port, urine (UA bland), CNS (no consistent
   symptoms)
   - seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain metastases
   - intracranial hemorrhage/mass effect/edema (no evidence on CT scan)
   Plan:
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes for no
   invasive procedures
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   - Touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] or covering neuro oncologist
   - transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction..
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - No schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS
   - Urine eos neg
   - bolus fluid/blood prn UOP
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or
   systolic <85, or if symptomatic. EF most recently 50% and satting 100%
   allowing for aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED).
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate [**Last Name (LF) 7676**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] repeat today to
   goal 30
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and benadryl prn (taken without worsened MS)
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with morphine IV prn, avoid oxycodone due to
   pruritis
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed.
   - Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 maintenance while NPO
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Likely hypoperfusion and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy due to renal failure, worsening LFT
   abnormalities and narcotics in setting of poor substrate and poor
   reserve leading to deficits as noted and exacerbation of old CVA
   deficits.
   Other likely contributors contributors:
   - toxic/metabolic secondary to electrolyte disturbances (in setting of
   acute renal failure and worsening LFTs)
   - left lower lobe infiltrate, likely aspiration
   Les likely contributors:
   - CVA or TIA,  (CT head prelim neg)
   - infection of indwelling port, urine (UA bland), CNS (no consistent
   symptoms)
   - seizures with post-ictal state in setting of brain metastases
   - intracranial hemorrhage/mass effect/edema (no evidence on CT scan)
   Plan:
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes for no
   invasive procedures
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   - Touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] or covering neuro oncologist
   - transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction..
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - No schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS
   - Urine eos neg
   - bolus fluid/blood prn UOP
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or
   systolic <85, or if symptomatic. EF most recently 50% and satting 100%
   allowing for aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED).
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate [**Last Name (LF) 7676**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] repeat today to
   goal 30
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and benadryl prn (taken without worsened MS)
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with morphine IV prn, avoid oxycodone due to
   pruritis
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed.
   - Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 maintenance while NPO
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA, and cardiomyopathy. She presents with altered mental status, weakness, and hypoperfusion. The patient has a history of poor PO intake, and her baseline blood pressure is 80-90/50. She is receiving chemotherapy, which may be contributing to her thrombocytopenia and anemia. She has a history of DVT and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypovolemia: The patient's blood pressure is 147/83 mmHg, which may indicate hypovolemia. Her cardiac output is also compromised due to cardiomyopathy.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be caused by hypovolemia, nephrotoxic medications, or underlying kidney disease.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may be contributing to her altered mental status.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 68, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.2 g/dL, which may be contributing to her weakness and fatigue.
6. Pruritis: The patient's pruritis may be caused by oxycodone or uremia.
7. Bilateral Leg Pain: The patient's bilateral leg pain may be caused by compression by known spinal mets.
8. Failure to Thrive: The patient has lost a significant amount of weight and has poor PO intake, which may be contributing to her overall decline.
9. History of DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
10. History of Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy, which may be contributing to her hypotension and decreased cardiac output.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's altered mental status, weakness, and hypoperfusion are likely caused by hypovolemia, electrolyte imbalance, and renal failure. The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia may be contributing to her bleeding risk. The patient's pruritis may be caused by oxycodone or uremia. The patient's bilateral leg pain may be caused by compression by known spinal mets. The patient's failure to thrive may be contributing to her overall decline.

The plan is to:

1. Continue IVF and pressors as needed to maintain blood pressure.
2. Monitor electrolyte levels and correct any imbalances.
3. Continue anticoagulation therapy for DVT.
4. Monitor platelet count and transfuse if necessary.
5. Continue anemia management with transfusions and iron supplements.
6. Manage pruritis with sarna and benadryl.
7. Manage bilateral leg pain with morphine IV prn.
8. Continue nutrition consultation and consider tube feeding if necessary.
9. Monitor for signs of bleeding and transfuse if necessary.
10. Continue to monitor and manage the patient's overall condition, including her cardiomyopathy and renal failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Ddx  includes infection (likely
   LLL infiltrate), hypocalcemia, leptomeningeal spread of breast CA,
   hypoperfusion, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy (pt was in renal
   failure), narcotics, seizure secondary to brain mets.  Could be
   contributing to exacerbation of  old CVA deficits.
   -CT of the head negtive for CVA or TIA, bleed, or new edema.  Pt still
   has innumerable calcified metastatic foci and mild edema.
   Plan:
   -Hypocalcemia: repleated Ca2+
   - Will discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] the possibility of leptomeningeal dz and
   whether LP and cytology would help.  Unable to get MRI given pt has
   severe clostrophobia.  Holding ibuprofen and coumadin given possibility
   of LP.
   -Bacterial meningitis in ddx but no meningeal sign/fever: pt already on
   ceftriaxone and vancomycin for PNA.  If concern for meningitis
   increases would start ampicillin.
   -Infection: LLL infiltrate likely.  Continue ceftriaxone and vanco.
   f/u blood cx still pending, urine cx negative
   -Goal MAP >55-60
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy
   -Haldol prn for agitation
   -Avoid narcotics and benadryl as much as possible
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal
   (fena 0.1%) in setting of poor PO intake reported by family and
   continuation of home BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her
   baseline creatinine is 0.5.  Trend of creatinine 2.3 -> 1.9 -> 1.7 ->
   0.8.
   -continue to trend creatinine
   .
   #PNA: continue cetriaxone and vancomycin.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50.  Today  pt normotensive (required fluid bolus earlier in
   admission).
   .
   #Increased LFTs
   -RUQ u/s today
   -follow LFTs
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 19 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: HCT since [**Month (only) 1088**] in 29-33 range. On presentation HCT was
   23.5 and now is 32. Suspect large part of this may be marrow
   suppression secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding
   (guaiac negative in ED).  s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate bump.
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient

   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.

   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with low doses of tylenol or ibuprofen.

   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Ddx  includes infection (likely
   LLL infiltrate), hypocalcemia, leptomeningeal spread of breast CA,
   hypoperfusion, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy (pt was in renal
   failure), narcotics, seizure secondary to brain mets.  Could be
   contributing to exacerbation of  old CVA deficits.
   -CT of the head negtive for CVA or TIA, bleed, or new edema.  Pt still
   has innumerable calcified metastatic foci and mild edema.
   Plan:
   -Hypocalcemia: repleated Ca2+
   - Will discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] the possibility of leptomeningeal dz and
   whether LP and cytology would help.  Unable to get MRI given pt has
   severe clostrophobia.  Holding ibuprofen and coumadin given possibility
   of LP.
   -Bacterial meningitis in ddx but no meningeal sign/fever: pt already on
   ceftriaxone and vancomycin for PNA.  If concern for meningitis
   increases would start ampicillin.
   -Infection: LLL infiltrate likely.  Continue ceftriaxone and vanco.
   f/u blood cx still pending, urine cx negative
   -Goal MAP >55-60
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy
   -Haldol prn for agitation
   -Avoid narcotics and benadryl as much as possible
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal
   (fena 0.1%) in setting of poor PO intake reported by family and
   continuation of home BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her
   baseline creatinine is 0.5.  Trend of creatinine 2.3 -> 1.9 -> 1.7 ->
   0.8.
   -continue to trend creatinine
   .
   #PNA: continue cetriaxone and vancomycin.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50.  Today  pt normotensive (required fluid bolus earlier in
   admission).

   -RUQ u/s today
   -follow LFTs
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 19 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: HCT since [**Month (only) 1088**] in 29-33 range. On presentation HCT was
   23.5 and now is 32. Suspect large part of this may be marrow
   suppression secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding
   (guaiac negative in ED).  s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate bump.
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   -.
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and atorax prn.
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation

   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR was supratherapeutic and now
   subtherapeutic. No current signs of bleeding or history of bleeding.
   - Holding coumadin given possibility of LP, type and cross sent in
   event she needs to be urgently reversed.
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**], a 74-year-old female with a past medical history of metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA, and cardiomyopathy, presents with altered mental status, tachycardia, and tachypnea. She has a history of renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and pruritis. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and anticoagulants.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Altered Mental Status:** The patient's altered mental status may be due to various causes, including infection, hypocalcemia, leptomeningeal spread of breast cancer, hypoperfusion, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy, or narcotics. The patient's mental status is of concern, as it may be exacerbating her old CVA deficits.
2. **Infection:** The patient is at risk for infection, particularly given her immunocompromised state and recent hospitalization. The possibility of bacterial meningitis is being considered, although the patient does not have meningeal signs or fever.
3. **Acute Renal Failure:** The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she has a history of poor PO intake and continuation of home BP medications. Her baseline creatinine is 0.5, and her current creatinine is 1.9. The patient's renal function needs to be closely monitored.
4. **Thrombocytopenia:** The patient's platelet count is 68, which may be due to marrow suppression from chemotherapy. The patient is at risk for bleeding, and her platelet count needs to be closely monitored.
5. **Anemia:** The patient's HCT is 32, which may be due to marrow suppression secondary to chemotherapy. The patient's anemia needs to be further evaluated.
6. **Pruritis:** The patient's pruritis may be due to oxycodone or uremia. The patient's skin examination is normal, and her TSH and ferritin levels are normal.
7. **Bilateral Leg Pain:** The patient's bilateral leg pain is likely due to compression by known spinal mets. The patient's rectal tone and sensation are intact, and there is no sign of cord compression or cauda equina.
8. **SVT:** The patient's SVT may be due to various causes, including anxiety, hyperventilation, or underlying cardiac disease. The patient's heart rate needs to be closely monitored.
9. **Breast Cancer:** The patient's breast cancer is being managed by her oncology team, and she will receive further treatment upon discharge.
10. **Failure to Thrive:** The patient has lost a significant amount of weight and has poor PO intake. A nutrition consult has been placed, and the patient is currently NPO.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including infection, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, anemia, pruritis, bilateral leg pain, SVT, breast cancer, and failure to thrive. The patient's condition needs to be closely monitored, and her treatment plan needs to be adjusted accordingly."

   24 Hour Events:
   - Pt tachy to 120s throughout day. Pt recieving 1u PRBC at the time,
   but was still tachy in 100s a couple hrs prior to getting blood. Pt
   denied pain or anxiety. She had no fevers, a normal TSH, and only
   slightly dry MM.  She had good UOP and +balance nearly 2L - so did not
   give further fluids at the time.  In addition the patient was already
   getting blood. HR came down on its own by 7pm
   - At 11:30pm pt became tachy to 150s - ?SVT. Pt agitated would not
   allow carotid massage, gave metop 5 IV x1, 500ml NS bolus, haldol 1mg
   x1, and pt 's HR returned to 90s.
   -Early in AM pt given benadry and morphine for itching and agitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Ddx  includes infection (likely
   LLL infiltrate), hypocalcemia, leptomeningeal spread of breast CA,
   hypoperfusion, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy (pt was in renal
   failure), narcotics, seizure secondary to brain mets.  Could be
   contributing to exacerbation of  old CVA deficits.
   -CT of the head negtive for CVA or TIA, bleed, or new edema.
   Plan:
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes for no
   invasive procedures
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   - Touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] or covering neuro oncologist
   - transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction..
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - No schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS
   - Urine eos neg
   - bolus fluid/blood prn UOP
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or
   systolic <85, or if symptomatic. EF most recently 50% and satting 100%
   allowing for aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED).
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate [**Last Name (LF) 7676**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] repeat today to
   goal 30
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and benadryl prn (taken without worsened MS)
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with morphine IV prn, avoid oxycodone due to
   pruritis
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Chief Complaint: Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past
   medical history of metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA
   and cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   24 Hour Events:
   - Pt tachy to 120s throughout day. Pt recieving 1u PRBC at the time,
   but was still tachy in 100s a couple hrs prior to getting blood. Pt
   denied pain or anxiety. She had no fevers, a normal TSH, and only
   slightly dry MM.  She had good UOP and +balance nearly 2L - so did not
   give further fluids at the time.  In addition the patient was already
   getting blood. HR came down on its own by 7pm
   - At 11:30pm pt became tachy to 150s - ?SVT. Pt agitated would not
   allow carotid massage, gave metop 5 IV x1, 500ml NS bolus, haldol 1mg
   x1, and pt 's HR returned to 90s.
   -Early in AM pt given benadry and morphine for itching and agitation.
   -HR to 150s at 7am. Gave metoprolol 5 IV x1 and HR decreased to 90s.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Ddx  includes infection (likely
   LLL infiltrate), hypocalcemia, leptomeningeal spread of breast CA,
   hypoperfusion, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy (pt was in renal
   failure), narcotics, seizure secondary to brain mets.  Could be
   contributing to exacerbation of  old CVA deficits.
   -CT of the head negtive for CVA or TIA, bleed, or new edema.
   Plan:
   - Will hold antibiotics for bacterial meningitis (already received
   vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin), given no true signs of
   meningmus on exam, no fevers, and history no really consistent with
   this, after further discussion with husband as noted above.
   - Follow up culture data (blood, sputum if possible, urine)
   - Follow up electrolytes in setting of acute renal failure
   - Follow up final head CT read, consider repeat imaging in next day or
   days to assess for evolving process.
   - Support blood pressure as needed with IVF and pressors if needed for
   MAP >55-60
   - No LP given elevated INR, thrombocytopenia, husband
s wishes for no
   invasive procedures
   - Renal failure management as discussed below
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy (waiting
   for LFTs to return, has history of liver involvement of metastases)
   - Touch base with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] or covering neuro oncologist
   - transfuse another unit pRBCs to HCT >30
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal in
   setting of poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home
   BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is
   0.5. Given lack of urination, post-obstructive etiology is also a
   possibility although she has no known metastates in the pelvis that
   would account for obstruction..
   - FeNa 0.1%, Una 12, Uosm 329
   - Will consider checking renal ultrasound in AM if not improving after
   hydration
   - No schistocytes on multiple smears to suspect TTPHUS
   - Urine eos neg
   - bolus fluid/blood prn UOP
   .
   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50. It has improved after receiving three liters of IVF to
   systolic currently 100-130's. No reason to be adrenal metastases known,
   but will consider [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim should she remain hypotensive. Does not
   appear to be sepsis but checking cultures. Also may have low baseline
   in setting of cardiomyopathy. In the ICU has gotten 1U pRBCs and 50cc
   D5HCO3 for low urine output with BPs in 80s-90s.
   - Continue D5 bicarb/blood boluses as needed for low urine output or
   systolic <85, or if symptomatic. EF most recently 50% and satting 100%
   allowing for aggressive fluid resuscitation.
   - Should she develop signs of fluid overload, will need to initiate
   pressor support
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 18 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: Patient's last HCT was 29, with values since [**Month (only) 1088**] in
   29-33 range. Today presentation HCT was 23.5, which is likely
   hemoconcentrated. Suspect large part of this may be marrow suppression
   secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding (guaiac negative
   in ED).
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   - s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate [**Last Name (LF) 7676**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] repeat today to
   goal 30
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.
   - Sarna and benadryl prn (taken without worsened MS)
   .
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   No sign of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and sensation
   in tact.
   - Unclear use of imaging given no plan for procedures.
   - Symptomatic treatment with morphine IV prn, avoid oxycodone due to
   pruritis
   - Will consider LENI for DVT in AM once stable (already therapeutic on
   coumadin though, and swelling is more on leg affected by stroke)
   .
   #. Breast Cancer: Per discussion with husband, further treatment will
   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.
   - Nutrition consult placed, NPO for now
   - Will need to further discuss this with husband and primary oncology
   team
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR is supratherapeutic. No current signs
   of bleeding or history of bleeding. Suspect given poor PO intake, lack
   of vitamin K in diet may be contributing to elevated INR.
   Administration of antibiotics may further increase INR.
   - Holding coumadin, type and cross sent in event she needs to be
   urgently reversed.
   - Will continue to monitor and unless starts to bleed
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in
   setting of hypotension. Will carefully monitor IVF intake given
   depressed EF, however appears hypovolemic at present.
   .
   #. FEN: IVF, D5NAHCO3 maintenance while NPO
   .
   #. Pain management with oxycodone, tylenol

Summary:

Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**], a 74-year-old female with a past medical history of metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA, and cardiomyopathy, presents with altered mental status, weakness, and hypotension. She has been experiencing pruritis, bilateral leg pain, and failure to thrive. Her laboratory results show thrombocytopenia, anemia, and acute renal failure. She is currently receiving IVF and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: Given the patient's altered mental status, weakness, and hypotension, infection is a potential complication. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection.
2. Hypocalcemia: The patient's laboratory results show low calcium levels, which can cause altered mental status, weakness, and hypotension.
3. Leptomeningeal spread of breast cancer: The patient's past medical history of metastatic breast cancer and her current symptoms of altered mental status and weakness may indicate leptomeningeal spread of breast cancer.
4. Hypoperfusion: The patient's hypotension and altered mental status may indicate hypoperfusion, which can cause organ dysfunction.
5. Toxic/metabolic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and weakness may be caused by toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including medications, electrolyte imbalances, and organ dysfunction.
6. Seizure secondary to brain mets: The patient's past medical history of brain metastases and her current symptoms of altered mental status and weakness may indicate seizure activity.
7. Acute renal failure: The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, which may indicate acute renal failure.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's laboratory results show low platelet count, which can cause bleeding complications.
9. Anemia: The patient's laboratory results show low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
10. Pruritis: The patient's symptoms of pruritis may be caused by a variety of factors, including allergic reactions, medication side effects, and skin conditions.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's altered mental status, weakness, and hypotension require immediate attention. The patient's laboratory results show evidence of infection, hypocalcemia, and acute renal failure, which need to be treated promptly. The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia require careful monitoring and treatment. The patient's pruritis may require treatment with antihistamines or corticosteroids.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Holding antibiotics for bacterial meningitis until further evaluation and testing.
2. Following up on culture data and laboratory results.
3. Monitoring the patient's electrolytes and renal function.
4. Providing supportive care, including IVF and antibiotics.
5. Considering repeat imaging to assess for evolving processes.
6. Holding anti-platelet agents and monitoring for signs of bleeding.
7. Transfusing blood products as necessary.
8. Providing pain management with oxycodone and tylenol.
9. Consulting with a nutritionist and considering a trial of megace.
10. Discussing management with the primary oncology team.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her husband has expressed a desire to avoid invasive procedures unless they would have a palliative effect."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of widely metastatic malignancy and multiple medical complications. The patient has experienced tachycardia, which responded to iv beta-blocker, and has been experiencing disorientation and confusion. The patient's mental status is altered, with concerns for toxic/metabolic response to pneumonia, hypocalcemia, CNS infection, leptomeningeal involvement of tumor, increased/progression of CNS tumor, encephalitis, and medication effect.

The patient has a mild case of hypocalcemia, which needs to be corrected. The patient also has pruritus, which is being treated symptomatically. The patient is experiencing agitation, which may be related to the underlying process. The patient has acute renal failure, which is resolving with iv fluids.

The patient has an indwelling iv catheter, which may be causing a line-related infection. Empirical antimicrobials have been started. The patient has a history of DVT and is being monitored for PT on coumadin. The patient's nutritional support is being withheld due to NPO status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and pruritus may be indicative of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is critical, and any deterioration in oxygenation or ventilation could lead to respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's tachycardia and altered mental status may increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly.
5. Infection: The patient's indwelling iv catheter and history of DVT increase the risk of line-related infection and DVT, respectively.
6. CNS complications: The patient's altered mental status and history of CNS tumor increase the risk of CNS complications, such as seizures, stroke, and meningitis.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's NPO status and history of malignancy increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and bowel obstruction.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of malignancy and extensive metastasis. They are currently admitted to the ICU for management of their condition. The patient has experienced tachycardia, which responded to iv beta-blocker, and has shown signs of disorientation and confusion. They have also experienced hypovolemia, which has improved with fluid replacement. The patient's mental status has been assessed as altered, with concerns about toxic or metabolic responses to pneumonia, hypocalcemia, CNS infection, or medication effects.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's indwelling iv catheter may be a source of line-related infection, and empirical antimicrobials have been started.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is resolving with iv fluids, but needs to be closely monitored.
3. Hypocalcemia: The patient has mild hypocalcemia, which needs to be corrected, and ionized calcium levels should be checked.
4. Pruritis: The patient is experiencing pruritis, which is being managed with symptomatic treatment and trial prn atarax.
5. Agitation: The patient's agitation is possible related to the underlying process and needs to be closely monitored.
6. Malignancy: The patient's extensive and widely metastatic malignancy needs to be managed accordingly.
7. DVT: The patient has a history of DVT and is on coumadin, which needs to be monitored, and may need to be held while considering LP.
8. NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT: The patient is NPO, and their nutritional needs need to be assessed and addressed.
9. ICU Care: The patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU, including prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Continue to manage the patient's hypovolemia with fluid replacement and monitor for signs of fluid overload.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypocalcemia and pruritis.
5. Consider LP to assess for infection or malignancy.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment accordingly.
7. Monitor the patient's DVT and adjust treatment accordingly.
8. Assess and address the patient's nutritional needs.
9. Continue to provide ICU care, including prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status, weakness: Ddx  includes infection (likely
   LLL infiltrate), hypocalcemia, leptomeningeal spread of breast CA,
   hypoperfusion, toxic/metabolic encephalopathy (pt was in renal
   failure), narcotics, seizure secondary to brain mets.  Could be
   contributing to exacerbation of  old CVA deficits.
   -CT of the head negtive for CVA or TIA, bleed, or new edema.  Pt still
   has innumerable calcified metastatic foci and mild edema.
   Plan:
   -Hypocalcemia: repleated Ca2+
   - Will discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] the possibility of leptomeningeal dz and
   whether LP and cytology would help.  Unable to get MRI given pt has
   severe clostrophobia.  Holding ibuprofen and coumadin given possibility
   of LP.
   -Bacterial meningitis in ddx but no meningeal sign/fever: pt already on
   ceftriaxone and vancomycin for PNA.  If concern for meningitis
   increases would start ampicillin.
   -Infection: LLL infiltrate likely.  Continue ceftriaxone and vanco.
   f/u blood cx still pending, urine cx negative
   -Goal MAP >55-60
   - Continue lactulose for question of hepatic encephalopathy
   -Haldol prn for agitation
   -Avoid narcotics and benadryl as much as possible
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Given elevated BUN, could be all pre-renal
   (fena 0.1%) in setting of poor PO intake reported by family and
   continuation of home BP medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her
   baseline creatinine is 0.5.  Trend of creatinine 2.3 -> 1.9 -> 1.7 ->
   0.8.
   -continue to trend creatinine
   .
   #PNA: continue cetriaxone and vancomycin.

   #. Hypotension: Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50.  Today  pt normotensive (required fluid bolus earlier in
   admission).

   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She is day 19 of her
   gemcitabine therapy, so this could represent marrow suppression from
   that cycle (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia.
   - Holding anti-platelet agents in setting of low count, no SQ heparin.
   - Monitor for signs of bleeding, transfuse should count be <20K or have
   symptoms
   .
   #. Anemia: HCT since [**Month (only) 1088**] in 29-33 range. On presentation HCT was
   23.5 and now is 32. Suspect large part of this may be marrow
   suppression secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding
   (guaiac negative in ED).  s/p transfusion of 1U with appropriate bump.
   - Hemolysis labs neg
   - poor reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively.
   - Iron, B12 and folate all nondeficient
   -.
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week. Most likely effect of
   oxycodone (timing consistent and common). Less likely uremia as
   pruritis persists after improved renal function, and bilirubin normal.
   TSH and ferritin also normal.

   be with different [**Doctor Last Name **], however at this time, no active treatment
   while inpatient.
   - Will further discuss management with primary oncology team in the AM
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR.

   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR was supratherapeutic and now
   subtherapeutic. No current signs of bleeding or history of bleeding.
   - Holding coumadin given possibility of LP, type and cross sent in
   event she needs to be urgently reversed.
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Cardiac complications (given history of cardiomyopathy and holding ACE-I, lasix, and coreg)

**Plan:**

* Continue monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies
* Continue treatment of hypocalcemia, infection, and PNA
* Monitor for signs of bleeding and transfuse as necessary
* Hold anti-platelet agents and coumadin until further discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**]
* Continue lactulose treatment for potential hepatic encephalopathy
* Avoid narcotics and benadryl as much as possible
* Continue to trend creatinine and monitor for signs of renal failure
* Consider further imaging studies (e.g., MRI) to evaluate for leptomeningeal disease
* Discuss management with primary oncology team and consider further treatment for breast cancer"

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8562**] is a 74 year old female with past medical history of
   metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA and
   cardiomyopathy, who presents with altered mental status and feeling of
   weakness on left side.  Has weakness on right side at baseline.
   .
   #.  Altered Mental Status: Pt had AMS on admission and thru [**2145-3-22**],
   oriented only to self and was combative.  On [**2145-3-23**] her mental status
   improved dramatically.  Thought likely to be toxic/metabolic factors in
   the setting of old CVA deficits. The toxic/metabolic factors could
   include PNA, oxycodone use, and possible small contribution of
   hypocalcemia.  There was concern for leptomeningeal disease given her
   metastatic breast cancer to the cerebellum, however, LP was not
   persueed given pt's mental status cleared and we would not expect it to
   resolve spontaneously.  Seizure could also be responsible if AMS was
   secondary to seizure. CT of the head was negtive for CVA or TIA, bleed,
   or new edema.  Pt still has innumerable calcified metastatic foci and
   mild edema.  She refused MRI given her severe clostrophobia.  Her
   oxycodone was discontinued and her calcium was repleated.  Pt did
   receive antibiotics for bacterial meningitis in the ED but they were
   not continued given that she had no fever or signs of meningismus.
   -d/c lactulose (was given for concern for hepatic encephalopathy )
   -avoid narcotics, low dose inbuprofen and Tylenol for pain.
   .
   #. PNA: Left retrocardiac mild PNA.
   -continue ceftriaxone and vanco.
   -f/u final on blood cx still pending
   .
   # Increased LFTs: RUQ was done for concern of rising LFTs given pt has
   liver mets.
   -Some biliary sludge found on RUQ ultrasound.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Pt was pre-renal (FENA 0.1%) in setting of
   poor PO intake reported by family and continuation of home BP
   medications (ACE-I, lasix, and Coreg). Her baseline creatinine is 0.5.
   Her creatinine on admission was 2.3. Pt had received fluid boluses
   early on in the admission for hypotension.
   -creatinine today at 0.6
   .
   #. Hypotension: Pt was hypotensive on admission to 67 SBP and she
   received fluid boluses. Per hematology/oncology clinic notes, patient's
   baseline blood pressure over the last several weeks was recorded as
   80-90/50.
   -consider restarting BP meds tomorrow.
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 68 on presentation. She was day 18 of
   her gemcitabine therapy so this liekly represent marrow suppression
   from that cycle. (WBC could be disporportionally up secondary to
   administration of GSC-F). Consistent with severity and timing of prior
   post chemo thrombocytopenia. Her coumadin was held. Her
   thrombocytonpenia improved to the 130s today.
   -continue to follow daily plts
   .
   #. Anemia: HCT since [**Month (only) 1088**] in 29-33 range. On presentation HCT was
   23.5 and now is 32. Suspect large part of this may be marrow
   suppression secondary to chemotherapy, as has no signs of bleeding
   (guaiac negative in ED).  Her hemolysis labs were negative.  Poor
   reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively. She received one unit of
   blood while in the ICU and bumped appropriately.  HCT stable at 28.8 on
   [**2145-3-23**].
   -daily HCT check
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week prior to admission. Most
   likely secondary to oxycodone.  She was treated with benedryl which was
   later discontinued due to her MS changes.
   -consider atarax prn puritis
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   She had no signs of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and
   sensation in tact. She was pain free on day of call out from ICU.
   -ibuprofen (low dose) or tylenol (low dose given liver fx) for pain
   control.
   .
   #SVT: Pt had 2 episodes of SVT while in the ICU with HR up to 150 which
   responded to metoprolol 5IV. No episodes of SVT on [**2145-3-23**].
   .
   # Breast Cancer: Not active pt while an in patient.
   -tx plan per primary oncologist
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR. She was seen by nutrition and
   originally placed on a restriceted diet.
   -advanced diet to soft dysphagia
   -continue supplement with boost/ensure.
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR was supratherapeutic on admission.
   She had no signs of bleeding.  Anticoagulation was held in anticipation
   of LP. Coumadin restarted on [**2145-3-23**] at 3mg daily down from home dose
   of 5mg daily given that she was supratherapeutic and also on
   antibiotics.
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Held ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in setting
   of hypotension.
   -consider restarting tomorrow.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   reticulocytosis and anemia of chronic disease to account for
   macrocytosis and microcytosis respectively. She received one unit of
   blood while in the ICU and bumped appropriately.  HCT stable at 28.8 on
   [**2145-3-23**].
   -daily HCT check
   .
   #. Pruritis: Per husband, and as noted on skin examination, this has
   been a major complaint over the last week prior to admission. Most
   likely secondary to oxycodone.  She was treated with benedryl which was
   later discontinued due to her MS changes.
   -consider atarax prn puritis
   #. Bilateral leg pain: Likely due to compression by known spinal mets.
   She had no signs of cord compresion or cauda equina as rectal tone and
   sensation in tact. She was pain free on day of call out from ICU.
   -ibuprofen (low dose) or tylenol (low dose given liver fx) for pain
   control.
   .
   #SVT: Pt had 2 episodes of SVT while in the ICU with HR up to 150 which
   responded to metoprolol 5IV. No episodes of SVT on [**2145-3-23**].
   .
   # Breast Cancer: Not active pt while an in patient.
   -tx plan per primary oncologist
   .
   #. Failure to thrive: Per OMR notes and discussion with husband, she
   has lost a significant amount of weight (>20 pounds) over the last
   several months, and has very poor PO intake. A trial of megace had been
   initiated, however this was stopped due to interaction with her
   coumadin and supratherapeutic INR. She was seen by nutrition and
   originally placed on a restriceted diet.
   -advanced diet to soft dysphagia
   -continue supplement with boost/ensure.
   .
   #. History of DVT: Patient's INR was supratherapeutic on admission.
   She had no signs of bleeding.  Anticoagulation was held in anticipation
   of LP. Coumadin restarted on [**2145-3-23**] at 3mg daily down from home dose
   of 5mg daily given that she was supratherapeutic and also on
   antibiotics.
   .
   #. History of cardiomyopathy: Held ACE-I, lasix, and coreg in setting
   of hypotension.
   -consider restarting tomorrow.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 74-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer, DVT on coumadin, prior CVA, and cardiomyopathy, presents with altered mental status, weakness on the left side, and a history of feeling of weakness on the right side at baseline. The patient's mental status improved dramatically on [**2145-3-23**], likely due to toxic/metabolic factors in the setting of old CVA deficits.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 4.5-5.8
* Hct: 22.6-32.0
* Plt: 68-130
* Cr: 0.6-1.9
* Glucose: 77-103
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.8/27.3/1.4, ALT/AST: 32/58, Alk Phos/T Bili: 103/0.9, Differential-Neuts: 77.0%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 5.0%, Mono: 15.0%, Eos: 2.0%, Fibrinogen: 373 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 0.8 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.2 g/dL, LDH: 411 IU/L, Ca++: 8.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Gen: alert, awake, cooperative, NAD, oriented to self, thought it was the 25th and asking how she got here
* Cardiac: rrr ns1/s2 no m/r/g
* Pulm: CTAB anteriorly
* ABD: +bs soft ntnd
* Extremities: right arm in flexion, 3-strength on right side, left side grip 4+/5, UE 4+/5 and LE plantarflexion 4+/5, DP pulses +1 bilaterally, and LE edema to above ankles +12-25.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Seizure: Given the patient's history of altered mental status and weakness on the left side, seizure is a possibility.
2. Infection: The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and differential, which may indicate infection.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be related to chemotherapy or other factors.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are low, which may be related to chemotherapy, anemia of chronic disease, or other factors.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be related to dehydration, medication, or other factors.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%, which may indicate respiratory failure.
7. Cardiac failure: The patient's history of cardiomyopathy and low blood pressure may indicate cardiac failure.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and differential, which may indicate sepsis.
10. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes and calcium levels, which may indicate metastatic disease progression.

Based on the patient's condition, the plan is to:

1. Continue antibiotics for bacterial meningitis.
2. Discontinue oxycodone and consider alternative pain management.
3. Replenish calcium levels.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusion if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and consider transfusion if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and consider restarting antihypertensive medications if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and consider non-invasive ventilation if necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider cardiology consultation if necessary.
9. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider gastrointestinal consultation if necessary.
10. Monitor the patient's overall condition and consider palliative care consultation if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of cancer, who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to altered mental status, delirium, and confusion. The patient's condition is attributed to toxic-metabolic dysfunction in the setting of infection/sepsis, with possible contributions from medication effects (Levofloxacin and narcotics) and a prior cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 107/46 mmHg. The patient is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and pain management medications.

The patient's laboratory results show mild hypocalcemia, with an ionized calcium level of 0.6 mg/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is 4.5-5.8 x 10^9/L, and their platelet count is 68-130 x 10^9/L. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 58 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 32 IU/L.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Continued ICU care with close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Administration of IV fluids to manage hypovolemia.
3. Management of hypocalcemia with calcium supplementation.
4. Antibiotic therapy for possible line-related infection.
5. Pain management with narcotics.
6. Resumption of PO nutrition under supervision.
7. Consideration of formal speech and swallow evaluation if concerns arise.

Potential medical complications:

1. Infection/sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and delirium may be attributed to toxic-metabolic dysfunction in the setting of infection/sepsis.
2. Hypocalcemia: The patient's mild hypocalcemia may require close monitoring and calcium supplementation to prevent complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may require continued IV fluids and close monitoring of kidney function.
4. Malignancy: The patient's extensive and widely metastatic cancer may require ongoing management and treatment.
5. Line-related infection: The patient's indwelling IV catheter may be at risk for line-related infection, which requires empirical antimicrobial therapy.
6. DVT: The patient's history of DVT may require continued anticoagulation therapy with coumadin.
7. Nutritional support: The patient's nutritional support may require close monitoring and adjustment to prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Altered mental status, delerium, confusion.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS,  DELIRIUM -- Subactue onset.  Attributed to
   toxic-metabolic dysfunction in setting of infection/sepsis, with
   possible contribution of medication effect (Levofloxicin, narcotics) on
   background of prior CVA.  Also consider seizure with post-ictal or
   confusional state --> consider EEG.
   HYPOVOLEMIA (VOLUME DEPLETION  -- improved.  Monitor.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- mild.  Check ionized.  Repleted.
   PRURITIS -- symptomatic treatment.  Resolved.
   AGGITATION -- resolved.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute, resolving with iv fluids.  Monitor.
   MALIGNANCY -- extensive, widely metastatic.
   Possible INFECTION -- indwelling iv catheter --> line related
   infection.  new LLL infiltrate --> Empirical antimicrobials.
   h/o DVT -- resume coumadin,  monitor PT on coumadin.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- resume PO under supervision.  Consider formal
   speech/swallow evaluation if concern.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition is as follows:

The patient's mental status has improved, with reduced agitation and beligerance. They are now cooperative and oriented. However, they still have altered mental status, delirium, and confusion, which is attributed to toxic-metabolic dysfunction in the setting of infection/sepsis, with possible contribution of medication effect (Levofloxacin and narcotics) on the background of prior CVA.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 107/46 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. They are receiving oxygen therapy and have a SpO2 of 96%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, and they are overweight/obese. They have a normal-sized head, normal pupillary reflexes, and normal breath sounds. They are able to follow simple commands and respond to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.6 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 4.5-5.8 K/uL
* Platelet count: 68-130 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6-1.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 77-103 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.8/27.3/1.4, ALT/AST: 32/58, Alk Phos/T Bili: 103/0.9, Differential-Neuts: 77.0%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 5.0%, Mono: 15.0%, Eos: 2.0%, Fibrinogen: 373 mg/dL, Lactic Acid: 0.8 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.2 g/dL, LDH: 411 IU/L, Ca++: 8.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Altered mental status, delirium, and confusion: continue to monitor and manage as needed.
* Hypovolemia: continue to monitor and manage as needed.
* Hypocalcemia: check ionized calcium and replete as needed.
* Pruritis: symptomatic treatment.
* Agitation: resolved.
* Renal failure: continue to monitor and manage as needed.
* Malignancy: continue to manage as needed.
* Possible infection: consider empirical antimicrobials.
* h/o DVT: resume coumadin and monitor PT on coumadin.
* Nutritional support: resume PO under supervision and consider formal speech/swallow evaluation if concern.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Infection/sepsis
* Malignancy progression
* Renal failure
* Electrolyte imbalance (hypocalcemia)
* Pruritis
* Agitation
* DVT

It is essential to continue to monitor the patient's condition and adjust their plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."
