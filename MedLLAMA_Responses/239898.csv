   without right heart strain. Possible developing right upper lobe
   infarct.
   2. Left upper lobe mass with extensive pulmonary and osseous
   metastases.
   3. Moderate-sized loculated left pleural effusion, slightly increased
   in size
   from prior, with resolution of previously noted left pneumothorax.
   Microbiology: None.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right main bronchus PE who developed A. fib with RVR on
   admission and respiratory distress.
   .
   1.  Respiratory distress.  Patient is known to have large PE and is
   anticoagulated with lovenox.  On admission, pt
s respiratory status
   worsened with A. fib with RVR to 150s and further deteriorated after
   getting 1LNS.  CXR demonstrated ?pulmonary edema likely secondary to
   fluids and rapid ventricular rate.  ABG demonstrated respiratory
   alkalosis and hypoxia with PAO2 of 93 on NRB.  Also possible worsening
   interstitial disease secondary to malignancy progression. He was
   diuresed with lasix, rate controlled with dilt drip then transitioned
   to po digoxin given SBPs in the 80s, treated with BiPAP and now on high
   flow mask with 5L oxygen with improvement in his respiratory status
   this morning.
   - Attempt to wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - Continue lovenox for PE.
   - Rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 852**] (oncologist) No ertonolib tx this admission for
   treatment of NSCLC.  IP saw pt  on [**1-28**] per Dr.[**Name (NI) 11944**] request for
   palliative throracentesis; not done as fluid amt too small to provide
   substantial benefit.
   -Given that pt is unlikely to require intubation, consider advancing
   diet today.
   .
   2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  Secondary to respiratory distress
   from known pulmonary processes.Low blood pressures make diltiazem
   boluses challenging, so initially placed on diltiazem drip then
   switched to po digoxin. Patient converted to NSR overnight on [**2180-1-28**].
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   3.  Pulmonary Embolism: Patient at high risk given malignancy.
   - Continue anticoagulation with lovenox
   - LENIs done for ?usefulness of IVC filter placement; negative for bil
   DVT.
   .
   3. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Not to be given this admission.
   - morphine for pain control
   .
   3. Hyponatremia.  Labs consistent with SIADH, likely secondary to lung
   cancer.
   - continue to trend [**Hospital1 **], now improved to 131.
   - Continue 1L daily fluid restriction.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +) admitted with a large right main bronchus PE, who developed A. fib with RVR on admission and respiratory distress. The patient's respiratory status worsened after getting 1LNS, and CXR demonstrated pulmonary edema likely secondary to fluids and rapid ventricular rate. The patient was diuresed with lasix, rate-controlled with dilt drip, then transitioned to PO digoxin, treated with BiPAP, and now on high-flow mask with 5L oxygen.

The patient's vital signs are:

* T: 35.9°C (96.6°F)
* HR: 103 bpm (89-103)
* BP: 112/59 mmHg (73-112/80)
* RR: 12 inspirations per minute (11-26)
* SpO2: 96%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: elderly male, NAD, alert
* CV: RRR, no murmurs, rubs, gallops
* PULM: CTAB, diminished breath sounds at LLL, no crackles or wheezing
* ABD: soft, non-tender, non-distended
* LIMBS: no edema, wwp, 2+ DP bil
* SKIN: no rash

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.7-6.8 K/uL
* Hct: 36.0-33.5%
* Plt: 144-150 K/uL
* Cr: 0.6-0.7 mg/dL
* TCO2: 22-19 mmol/L
* Glucose: 104-91 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.0/33.9/1.0, Lactic Acid: 1.9 mmol/L, Ca++: 8.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 3.8 mg/dL

Imaging studies reveal:

* CXR: pulmonary edema likely secondary to fluids and rapid ventricular rate, bilateral reticular opacities in both lungs suggesting diffuse metastasis
* Echo: mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, LVEF >55%, trivial MR, trace aortic regurg, and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
* CT chest: extensive right main, segmental, and subsegmental pulmonary emboli without right heart strain, possible developing right upper lobe infarct, left upper lobe mass with extensive pulmonary and osseous metastases, moderate-sized loculated left pleural effusion

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: due to the patient's respiratory distress and pulmonary embolism
2. Atrial fibrillation: secondary to respiratory distress and pulmonary processes
3. Pulmonary embolism: given the patient's malignancy and anticoagulation therapy
4. Hyponatremia: likely secondary to SIADH, which may worsen the patient's condition
5. Malignancy progression: the patient's NSCLC may continue to progress, leading to further complications
6. Infection: the patient is at risk of developing infections due to his immunocompromised state
7. Cardiac complications: the patient's cardiac status may deteriorate due to his atrial fibrillation and pulmonary hypertension
8. Neurological complications: the patient's basal ganglia metastases may lead to neurological symptoms or complications"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 81-year-old male admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath (SOB). He has a history of non-small-cell lung cancer with EGFR-mutated adenocarcinoma and stage IV disease, with a median survival of 24 months. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 112/59 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is currently on digoxin for rate control and has been converted to normal sinus rhythm. The patient's respiratory status is improving, and intubation is not currently necessary.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 144. His creatinine is 0.6 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen is 22 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Imaging studies show bilateral reticular opacities in both lungs, consistent with diffuse metastasis. The patient has mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is also evidence of moderate-sized loculated left pleural effusion and possible developing right upper lobe infarct.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's lung cancer and metastasis may lead to respiratory failure, which could require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's mild cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's extensive right main, segmental, and subsegmental pulmonary emboli may lead to pulmonary embolism, which could be life-threatening.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to cancer and chemotherapy may increase his risk of infection, which could be life-threatening.
5. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase his risk of bleeding, especially if he requires invasive procedures or has a traumatic injury.
6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate kidney damage or failure, which could require dialysis.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but he is at risk for various medical complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with stage IV lung cancer, admitted two days ago with pulmonary embolism (PE) and atrial fibrillation (AFib). He is currently in the ICU for management of his condition. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 120/76 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. He is receiving non-invasive ventilation and has been converted to sinus rhythm. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential medical complications:

1. Recurrence of atrial fibrillation: The patient's AFib may recur, which could lead to tachycardia and further complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, requiring increased oxygen support or mechanical ventilation.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's PE may not be fully treated, leading to further complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, or even death.
4. Cancer progression: The patient's lung cancer may progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his immunosuppressed state and the presence of central lines and other invasive devices.
6. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to his anticoagulation therapy and thrombocytopenia.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's AFib may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, which could be life-threatening.
8. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his immunosuppressed state and the presence of invasive devices.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Maintain the patient's sinus rhythm with digoxin and continue to monitor for recurrence of AFib.
3. Continue to provide respiratory support as needed, and wean the patient off oxygen as tolerated.
4. Continue anticoagulation therapy for the patient's PE.
5. Consider starting chemotherapy for the patient's lung cancer once he has achieved adequate functional status.
6. Continue to provide prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.
7. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and bleeding.
8. Consider placing the patient on stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prophylaxis."

   Imaging:
   CXR [**2180-1-30**]:
   Increasing parenchymal opacity is seen at the right lung diffusely,
   particularly in the upper lobe as well as in the left lower and mid
   lung
   zones. The pattern is most consistent with a combination of alveolar
   and
   interstitial disease. There is a left-sided pleural effusion that
   appears
   similarly to the prior study. The heart size is not changed
   substantially
   since the prior study and there is no PTX.
   IMPRESSION: Worsening airspace disease nonspecific - pneumonia, CHF or
   ARDS
   should be considered.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right main bronchus PE who developed A. fib with RVR on
   admission and respiratory distress.
   .
   1.  Respiratory distress.  Patient is known to have large PE and is
   anticoagulated with lovenox.  Now with worsening hypoxia, requiring a
   NRB.  ABG c/w PE, tachypnea.  CXR shows dramatically worsening opacity
   in RUL, c/w PNA/pulmonary edema or ARDS.  As no clinical signs of
   infection or fluid overload, this most likely represents sequelae of
   his large PE, perhaps a pulmonary infarct, leading to ARDS.  Also
   possible lymphangitic carcinomatosis, but acuity of course argues
   against this.  Currently oxygenating well on NRB, but his respiratory
   status is clearly deteriorating.
   - Attempt to wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - Continue lovenox for PE.
   - Rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - intubate if respiratory status worsens significantly
   .
   2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, now in sinus tachycardia.
   This is likely secondary to his PE.
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   3.  Pulmonary Embolism: Patient at high risk given malignancy.
   - Continue anticoagulation with lovenox
   - LENIs done for ?usefulness of IVC filter placement; negative for bil
   DVT.
   .
   3. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Not to be given this admission.
   - morphine for pain control
   .
   3. Hyponatremia.  Labs consistent with SIADH, likely secondary to lung
   cancer.
   - trend serum Na
   - Continue 1L daily fluid restriction.

   Imaging:
   CXR [**2180-1-30**]:
   Increasing parenchymal opacity is seen at the right lung diffusely,
   particularly in the upper lobe as well as in the left lower and mid
   lung
   zones. The pattern is most consistent with a combination of alveolar
   and
   interstitial disease. There is a left-sided pleural effusion that
   appears
   similarly to the prior study. The heart size is not changed
   substantially
   since the prior study and there is no PTX.
   IMPRESSION: Worsening airspace disease nonspecific - pneumonia, CHF or
   ARDS
   should be considered.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right main bronchus PE who developed A. fib with RVR on
   admission and respiratory distress.
   .
   1.  Respiratory distress.  Patient is known to have large PE and is
   anticoagulated with lovenox.  Now with worsening hypoxia, requiring a
   NRB.  ABG c/w PE, tachypnea.  CXR shows dramatically worsening opacity
   in RUL, c/w PNA/pulmonary edema or ARDS.  As no clinical signs of
   infection or fluid overload, this most likely represents sequelae of
   his large PE, perhaps a pulmonary infarct, leading to ARDS.  Also
   possible lymphangitic carcinomatosis, but acuity of course argues
   against this.  Currently oxygenating well on NRB, but his respiratory
   status is clearly deteriorating.
   - Attempt to wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - Continue lovenox for PE.
   - Rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - intubate if respiratory status worsens significantly
   .
   2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, now in sinus tachycardia.
   This is likely secondary to his PE.
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   3.  Pulmonary Embolism: Patient at high risk given malignancy.
   - Continue anticoagulation with lovenox
   - LENIs done for ?usefulness of IVC filter placement; negative for bil
   DVT.
   .
   3. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Not to be given this admission.
   - morphine for pain control
   .
   3. Hyponatremia.  Labs consistent with SIADH, likely secondary to lung
   cancer.
   - trend serum Na
   - Continue 1L daily fluid restriction.

Summary:

The patient, a 65-year-old male with stage IV NSCLC and EGFR mutation, was admitted to the ICU with a large right main bronchus PE, A. fib with RVR, and respiratory distress. He is anticoagulated with Lovenox and requires a non-rebreather mask to maintain oxygen saturation. His respiratory status is deteriorating, and he is at risk of developing ARDS or pulmonary infarct. He also has atrial fibrillation with RVR, which is likely secondary to his PE.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and he may require intubation if he does not respond to oxygen therapy.
2. ARDS or pulmonary infarct: The patient's worsening airspace disease on CXR may indicate the development of ARDS or pulmonary infarct, which could further compromise his respiratory status.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may continue to cause tachycardia and potentially lead to cardiac complications.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's large PE and anticoagulation with Lovenox may increase his risk of bleeding or further pulmonary embolism.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may worsen if he continues to experience SIADH, which could lead to seizures, coma, or even death.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and respiratory distress make him susceptible to infection, which could further complicate his condition.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and PE may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

Recommendations:

1. Continue oxygen therapy and monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
2. Consider intubation if the patient's respiratory status does not improve with oxygen therapy.
3. Continue anticoagulation with Lovenox to prevent further pulmonary embolism.
4. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and consider rate control with digoxin.
5. Trend the patient's serum sodium levels and continue fluid restriction to prevent worsening hyponatremia.
6. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and consider empiric antibiotics if necessary.
7. Consider placement of an IVC filter to reduce the risk of further pulmonary embolism."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU due to shortness of breath, hypoxia, and tachycardia. The patient's medical history is significant for atrial fibrillation, and they are on home pain medication. They are unable to provide a history due to a language barrier. The patient has undergone conversion to sinus rhythm with digoxin. They have been experiencing desaturation events, with the most recent episode being treated with 100% non-rebreather oxygen and a chest X-ray.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 115/86 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. They are receiving oxygen therapy via a non-rebreather mask and have a saturation level of 92%. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of desaturation events and requirement for oxygen therapy suggests a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's atrial fibrillation and tachycardia may indicate underlying cardiovascular instability, which could lead to cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
4. Bleeding: The patient's elevated platelet count and INR may indicate a risk of bleeding, particularly with invasive procedures or anticoagulant therapy.
5. Renal impairment: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output may indicate renal impairment, which could lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels have been fluctuating, and there is a risk of hypoglycemia, particularly with the use of insulin and other glucose-lowering medications.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to provide a history and language barrier may make it difficult to assess their nutritional needs and provide adequate nutrition.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's condition to prevent further deterioration and improve their chances of recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right main bronchus PE who developed A. fib with RVR on
   admission and respiratory distress.
   .
   1.  Respiratory distress.  Patient is known to have large PE and is
   anticoagulated with lovenox.  On admission, pt
s respiratory status
   worsened with A. fib with RVR to 150s and further deteriorated after
   getting 1LNS.  CXR demonstrated ?pulmonary edema likely secondary to
   fluids and rapid ventricular rate.  ABG demonstrated respiratory
   alkalosis and hypoxia with PAO2 of 93 on NRB.  Also possible worsening
   interstitial disease secondary to malignancy progression. He was
   diuresed with lasix, rate controlled with dilt drip then transitioned
   to po digoxin given SBPs in the 80s, treated with BiPAP and now on high
   flow mask with 5L oxygen with improvement in his respiratory status
   this morning.
   - Attempt to wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - Continue lovenox for PE.
   - Rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 852**] (oncologist) No ertonolib tx this admission for
   treatment of NSCLC.  IP saw pt  on [**1-28**] per Dr.[**Name (NI) 11944**] request for
   palliative throracentesis; not done as fluid amt too small to provide
   substantial benefit.
   -Given that pt is unlikely to require intubation, consider advancing
   diet today.
   .
   2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  Secondary to respiratory distress
   from known pulmonary processes.Low blood pressures make diltiazem
   boluses challenging, so initially placed on diltiazem drip then
   switched to po digoxin. Patient converted to NSR overnight on [**2180-1-28**].
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   3.  Pulmonary Embolism: Patient at high risk given malignancy.
   - Continue anticoagulation with lovenox
   - LENIs done for ?usefulness of IVC filter placement; negative for bil
   DVT.
   .
   3. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Not to be given this admission.
   - morphine for pain control
   .
   3. Hyponatremia.  Labs consistent with SIADH, likely secondary to lung
   cancer.
   - continue to trend [**Hospital1 **], now improved to 131.
   - Continue 1L daily fluid restriction.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient, a 65-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and EGFR mutation, was admitted with a large right main bronchus pulmonary embolism (PE) and developed atrial fibrillation (A. fib) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR). He is being treated with anticoagulation with lovenox and has been diuresed with lasix. He is on high-flow mask with 5L oxygen and has improved respiratory status this morning.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Respiratory Distress:** The patient's respiratory status can worsen due to the underlying pulmonary processes, and he may require further interventions such as intubation.
2. **Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:** The patient's A. fib with RVR can lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, and may require further rate control measures.
3. **Pulmonary Embolism:** The patient is at high risk for recurrent PE due to his malignancy, and further interventions such as IVC filter placement may be necessary.
4. **NSCLC Progression:** The patient's lung cancer may continue to progress, leading to further respiratory and cardiac complications.
5. **Hyponatremia:** The patient's hyponatremia may worsen due to his underlying lung cancer, leading to further electrolyte imbalances.
6. **Infection:** The patient is at risk for infection due to his underlying conditions and the use of invasive devices, such as central lines and oxygen delivery devices.
7. **Fluid Overload:** The patient's fluid overload can worsen due to his underlying conditions and the use of diuretics, leading to further respiratory and cardiac complications.

**Plan:**

1. Continue anticoagulation with lovenox for PE.
2. Monitor respiratory status and adjust oxygen therapy as necessary.
3. Continue rate control measures with digoxin.
4. Monitor atrial fibrillation and adjust therapy as necessary.
5. Consider advancing diet today.
6. Continue anticoagulation with lovenox for NSCLC.
7. Monitor for signs of infection and fluid overload.
8. Trend electrolytes and adjust therapy as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of metastatic lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU with pulmonary embolism (PE) and atrial fibrillation (AFIB). He has been treated with anticoagulation therapy and has had his sinus rhythm restored. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 116/78 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with worsening diffuse infiltrates on the right side of his chest seen on chest X-ray (CXR), which may indicate hemorrhage, infarction, or worsening of lymphangitic carcinomatosis. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and is being weaned off it as tolerated.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and platelet count (Plt), which may indicate an inflammatory response or bleeding. The patient's electrolyte levels, including potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), and chloride (Cl-), are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE) recurrence: The patient is at risk of developing another PE due to his underlying lung cancer and the presence of a pulmonary embolism.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening diffuse infiltrates on CXR may indicate a worsening respiratory status, which can lead to respiratory failure.
3. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and elevated platelet count may increase his risk of bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be further evaluated and treated.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and underlying lung cancer may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to tolerate food and his elevated glucose levels may indicate nutritional deficiencies, which need to be addressed.
7. Lymphangitic carcinomatosis: The patient's worsening diffuse infiltrates on CXR may indicate a worsening of lymphangitic carcinomatosis, which can lead to respiratory failure and other complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right main bronchus PE who developed A. fib with RVR on
   admission and respiratory distress.
   .
   1.  Respiratory distress.  Patient is known to have large PE and is
   anticoagulated with lovenox.  Now with worsening hypoxia, requiring a
   NRB.  ABG c/w PE, tachypnea.  CXR shows dramatically worsening opacity
   in RUL, c/w PNA/pulmonary edema or ARDS.  As no clinical signs of
   infection or fluid overload, this most likely represents sequelae of
   his large PE, perhaps a pulmonary infarct, leading to ARDS.  Also
   possible lymphangitic carcinomatosis, but acuity of course argues
   against this.  Currently oxygenating well on NRB, but his respiratory
   status is clearly deteriorating.
   - Attempt to wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - Continue lovenox for PE.
   - Rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - intubate if respiratory status worsens significantly
   .
   2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, now in sinus tachycardia.
   This is likely secondary to his PE.
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   3.  Pulmonary Embolism: Patient at high risk given malignancy.
   - Continue anticoagulation with lovenox
   - LENIs done for ?usefulness of IVC filter placement; negative for bil
   DVT.
   .
   3. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Not to be given this admission.
   - morphine for pain control
   .
   3. Hyponatremia.  Labs consistent with SIADH, likely secondary to lung
   cancer.
   - trend serum Na
   - Continue 1L daily fluid restriction.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient, a 65-year-old male with stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation positive), was admitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure and large right main bronchus PE. He was intubated due to worsening respiratory distress, tachycardia, and frequent runs of SVT. He developed atrial fibrillation with RVR following intubation and required neostigmine due to hypotension. He was started on ARDSnet ventilation and was struggling with synchrony, eventually switching to APRV. His current status shows worsening airspace disease, possibly pneumonia, CHF, or ARDS.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and he may require intubation if it worsens significantly. He is at risk for pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or ARDS, possibly secondary to his large PE.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation may be secondary to his PE, and he is at risk for complications such as stroke or cardiac arrest.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is at high risk for pulmonary embolism due to his malignancy and is being treated with anticoagulation with lovenox.
4. NSCLC: The patient has metastatic NSCLC and is at risk for further progression of his disease.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is likely secondary to SIADH, and he is at risk for further electrolyte imbalances.
6. Infections: The patient is at risk for infections, particularly pneumonia, due to his intubation and immunocompromised state.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient is at risk for cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest, due to his atrial fibrillation and hypotension.

Recommendations:

1. Continue anticoagulation with lovenox for PE.
2. Monitor respiratory status and intubate if necessary.
3. Continue digoxin for rate control and monitor HR.
4. Continue anticoagulation with lovenox for PE.
5. Monitor serum Na and continue 1L daily fluid restriction for hyponatremia.
6. Monitor for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, and changes in respiratory status.
7. Monitor for cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest, and provide appropriate treatment if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure. He was intubated due to worsening respiratory distress, tachycardia, and frequent runs of SVT. He developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) after intubation and required neuromuscular blockade. The patient has a history of cancer, and the impression is worsening airspace disease, potentially due to pneumonia, CHF, or ARDS.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.9°C (100.2°F)
* Heart rate: 114 bpm (sinus tachycardia)
* Blood pressure: 84/62 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 93%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.8-8.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.8-11.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 150-200 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5-0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 67-106 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.6 mmol/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CXR: Increasing parenchymal opacity in the right lung, particularly in the upper lobe, and in the left lower and mid lung zones, consistent with a combination of alveolar and interstitial disease. There is a left-sided pleural effusion.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Pneumonia
* CHF
* ARDS
* Pulmonary embolism
* Cancer progression
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Hypotension
* Sepsis

The patient's plan includes:

* Continued mechanical ventilation with APRV mode
* Antibiotic therapy for potential pneumonia
* Cardiac monitoring for arrhythmias
* Hemodynamic monitoring for hypotension
* Nutritional support
* Glycemic control
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

   Imaging: CXR [**2180-1-30**]:
   Increasing parenchymal opacity is seen at the right lung diffusely,
   particularly in the upper lobe as well as in the left lower and mid
   lung
   zones. The pattern is most consistent with a combination of alveolar
   and
   interstitial disease. There is a left-sided pleural effusion that

   similarly to the prior study. The heart size is not changed
   substantially
   since the prior study and there is no PTX.

 hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Patient becoming
   preogressively more hypercarbic.
   -titrate up RR, TV as needed to reduce acidemia.
   - fluid bolus with LR
   3. Shock.  Likely cardiogenic, [**12-21**] PE and now with decreased pre load
   from positive pressure ventilation.  Possibly hypovolemic, but given ~
   4L
   Patient is known to have large PE and is anticoagulated with lovenox.
   Now with worsening hypoxia, requiring a NRB.  ABG c/w PE, tachypnea.
   CXR shows dramatically worsening opacity in RUL, c/w PNA/pulmonary
   edema or ARDS.  As no clinical signs of infection or fluid overload,
   this most likely represents sequelae of his large PE, perhaps a
   pulmonary infarct, leading to ARDS.  Also possible lymphangitic
   carcinomatosis, but acuity of course argues against this.  Currently
   oxygenating well on NRB, but his respiratory status is clearly
   deteriorating.
   - Attempt to wean oxygen as tolerated.
   - Continue lovenox for PE.
   - Rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - intubate if respiratory status worsens significantly
   .
   2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, now in sinus tachycardia.
   This is likely secondary to his PE.
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.

   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Not to be given this admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Code status: Full code<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications and potential issues are identified:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) with hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
	* Intubation and paralysis on LTTV (Long-Term Tracheal Tube Ventilation) with FiO2 of 100%
	* Worsening airspace disease, possibly due to pneumonia, CHF (Congestive Heart Failure), or ARDS
	* Increasing PaCO2 levels, indicating progressive hypercarbia
2. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Shock, likely cardiogenic, possibly due to decreased preload from positive pressure ventilation
	* Atrial fibrillation with RVR (Right Ventricular Failure), likely secondary to pulmonary embolism
	* Rate control with digoxin 0.125 mg daily
3. Pulmonary Complications:
	* Large pulmonary embolism (PE) with possible pulmonary infarct or lymphangitic carcinomatosis
	* Increasing parenchymal opacity on CXR (Chest X-ray) consistent with alveolar and interstitial disease
4. Cancer-Related Complications:
	* NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer) with metastases to spine, sternum, ribs, and basal ganglia
	* Hyponatremia likely secondary to lung cancer, possibly due to SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone) secretion
5. Other Complications:
	* Hypotension requiring vasopressors (phenylephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin)
	* Fluid overload with 2,611 mL of IV fluids in 24 hours
	* Risk of DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis) due to malignancy and anticoagulation with Lovenox
	* Potential need for IVC filter placement

The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring is necessary to address these complications and potential issues."

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a history of EGFR mutation, who was admitted with large right pulmonary embolism (PE) and developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). He was intubated due to worsening respiratory distress and is now on mechanical ventilation with FiO2 of 100%. The patient has ARDS, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and shock. He is anticoagulated with lovenox and has a left-sided pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening ARDS: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and he is at risk of further worsening of ARDS.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a large PE and is at risk of developing further emboli, which can lead to recurrent PE and ARDS.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has AFib with RVR, which can lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure and stroke.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which can lead to seizures, coma, and even death if left untreated.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia, which can worsen his respiratory status and overall condition.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient has a left-sided pleural effusion, which can lead to fluid overload and worsen his respiratory status.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, and he is at risk of developing respiratory failure, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and optimize respiratory support.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
3. Continue anticoagulation with lovenox to prevent further PE.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider rate control with digoxin.
5. Monitor the patient's serum sodium levels and consider treating hyponatremia if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and fluid overload.
7. Consider placing an IVC filter to prevent further PE.
8. Consider weaning the patient off mechanical ventilation if his respiratory status improves.
9. Continue pain management with morphine.
10. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider providing enteral nutrition if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +) admitted with a large right main bronchus PE who developed atrial fibrillation with RVR on admission and respiratory distress. The patient was intubated due to worsening respiratory distress, tachycardia, and frequent runs of SVT.

The patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory distress, requiring invasive ventilation with APRV mode
* Atrial fibrillation with RVR, currently in sinus tachycardia
* Pulmonary embolism, with increasing parenchymal opacity on CXR, consistent with a combination of alveolar and interstitial disease
* Hyponatremia, likely secondary to lung cancer, with labs consistent with SIADH
* Hypotension, requiring maximum dose of phenylephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin
* Tachycardia, with frequent runs of SVT

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening respiratory failure, requiring further escalation of respiratory support
* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation
* Pulmonary edema or ARDS, leading to further respiratory distress
* Sepsis or septic shock, due to potential bacterial or fungal infection
* Acute kidney injury or failure, due to hypotension and decreased renal perfusion
* Increased risk of bleeding, due to anticoagulation therapy and invasive procedures

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Invasive ventilation with APRV mode
* Anticoagulation with lovenox for PE
* Rate control with digoxin for atrial fibrillation
* Monitoring of respiratory status, cardiac rhythm, and laboratory values
* Consideration for intubation if respiratory status worsens significantly
* Continued fluid restriction to manage hyponatremia
* Morphine for pain control
* Regular nutrition and glycemic control"

   Imaging: CXR [**2180-1-30**]:
   Increasing parenchymal opacity is seen at the right lung diffusely,
   particularly in the upper lobe as well as in the left lower and mid
   lung
   zones. The pattern is most consistent with a combination of alveolar
   and
   interstitial disease. There is a left-sided pleural effusion that
   appears
   similarly to the prior study. The heart size is not changed
   substantially
   since the prior study and there is no PTX.
   IMPRESSION: Worsening airspace disease nonspecific - pneumonia, CHF or

   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right PE who developed A. fib with RVR on admission and now
   with dramatic clinical deterioration overnight with ARDS,
   intubation/mechanical ventilation and shock requiring maximal pressors.
   .
   1.  ARDS
 hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Patient now intubated and
   paralyzed on LTVV, requiring FiO2 of 100%.
   - continue LTTV, increase PEEP and decrease FiO2 as tolerated, maxiumum
   plateau pressure of 30.
   - permissive hypercapnia
   2.  ARDS
 hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Patient becoming
   progressively more hypercarbic.
   - titrate up RR, TV as needed to reduce acidemia.
   - fluid bolus with LR
   - consider IV bicarb if continues to worsen
   3. Shock.  Likely cardiogenic, [**12-21**] PE and now with decreased pre load
   from positive pressure ventilation.  Possibly hypovolemic, but given ~
   4L yesterday.  Septic shock less likely given no e/o infection, but
   willobtainc ultures regardless, given patient
s critical status.  Other
   cardiogenic causes possible (ie. Ischemia) but nl echo two days ago.
   - bolus LR prn
   - target MAP 65
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   .
   4. Pulmonary Embolism
   - continue lovenox
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, now in sinus tachycardia.
   Several episodes of SVT and afib with RVR yesterday, in the setting of
   severe respiratory distress
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   6. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Discuss goals with oncology given
   significant clinical deterioration.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and EGFR mutation positive, admitted with large right pulmonary embolism (PE) who developed atrial fibrillation with right ventricular failure (RVR) on admission and now with dramatic clinical deterioration overnight with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intubation, mechanical ventilation, and shock requiring maximal pressors.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated and paralyzed on LTVV, requiring FiO2 of 100%. ARDS with hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure.
* Cardiovascular: Shock likely cardiogenic, possibly hypovolemic, with decreased preload from positive pressure ventilation.
* Hemodynamic: Hypotensive, requiring maximum dose of phenylephrine, norepinephrine, and vasopressin.
* Neurological: Atrial fibrillation with RVR, previously in sinus tachycardia, with several episodes of SVT and afib with RVR yesterday.
* Laboratory: Worsening airspace disease, possibly pneumonia, CHF, or ARDS, with increasing parenchymal opacity in the right lung diffusely.
* Imaging: CXR shows increasing parenchymal opacity in the right lung diffusely, with a left-sided pleural effusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Progression of ARDS: Continued worsening of hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, leading to further deterioration in respiratory status.
2. Cardiac complications: Cardiogenic shock, hypovolemic shock, or septic shock, leading to further deterioration in cardiovascular status.
3. Pulmonary embolism: Continued risk of further PE, potentially leading to worsening respiratory and cardiovascular status.
4. Infection: Risk of infection, particularly pneumonia, given the patient's immunocompromised state and respiratory status.
5. Bleeding: Risk of bleeding, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding, given the patient's anticoagulation therapy and respiratory status.
6. Neurological complications: Further deterioration in neurological status, potentially leading to increased risk of stroke or seizures.
7. Metastatic disease: Progression of NSCLC, potentially leading to further deterioration in respiratory and cardiovascular status.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should be closely monitored and managed with aggressive respiratory and cardiovascular support, as well as anticoagulation therapy and infection prevention measures."

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with history of lung cancer and admitted with PE complicated
   by A-fib and hypoxemic respiratory failure.  He has had substantial
   worsening across past 24 hours now to the point of persistent and dense
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe shock likely secondary to both
   compromise of right heart SV in the setting of ARDS as well as
   vasodilatory shock in the setting of ARDS.
   1)Respiratory Failure-have pursued alternative modes of ventilation but
   still have severe respiratory acidosis in the setting of some improved
   capacity to stabilize oxygenation on FIO2 of 1.0.  We are left,
   however, with persistent and severe hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   This is attributable to significant dead space ventilation which has
   unfortunately progressed at this time.  This may be due to ineffective
   perfusion, overdistention of non-dependent lung units.  We have RR at a
   maximum at this time.  For his respiratory failure we will
   A)Hypoxemia
he will have PEEP titration today to determine optimal PEEP
   and hopefully allow some down titration of FIO2
   -Fent/Versed/Cisatra--at
 to allow passive support today
   -Will maintain FIO2 at 1.0
   -Will have to consider move to prone position if we are unable to
   maintain effective saturation with above measures.
   B)Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure-
   -This will have to be improved given severe acidemia
   -Will increase RR to 30 as possible
   -Will remove dead space from ventilatory circuit
   -Will have to increase tidal volume even though we will move beyond
   6cc/Kg given inability to maintain acceptable ventilation at this time
   -Will trial fluid bolus if are left with persistent and severe
   compromise of effective ventilation
   2)Shock-
   -Will need to evaluate CvO2 this morning to aid in confirmation of
   source of shock which at this point may well be a dominant finding of
   vasodilatory shock where what may have been a relative hypovolemic
   state at the onset.  In addition
we will need reasonable assessment of
   CVP at this time with a goal CVP of approximately 12 viewed as
   significant evidence against hypovolemic shock
   -Will check CvO2 to guide differential
   -Will send cultures for possible septic source if fever seen
   -Vasopressin 0.4-Levophed 0.45-Neo to continue
will look to correct pH
   as we can with ventilator and will utilize HCO3- as needed for blood
   pressure response
   -Will check ECG for possible myocardial ischemia
   -Do not see evidence of recurrent PE but is certainly of concern
   3) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   -Rate control as needed
   -SR for now
   4) PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   -On Lovenox
   5) CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), LUNG-
   -Will update primary oncology team in light of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with history of lung cancer and admitted with PE complicated
   by A-fib and hypoxemic respiratory failure.  He has had substantial
   worsening across past 24 hours now to the point of persistent and dense
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe shock likely secondary to both
   compromise of right heart SV in the setting of ARDS as well as
   vasodilatory shock in the setting of ARDS.
   1)Respiratory Failure-have pursued alternative modes of ventilation but
   still have severe respiratory acidosis in the setting of some improved
   capacity to stabilize oxygenation on FIO2 of 1.0.  We are left,
   however, with persistent and severe hypercarbic respiratory failure.
   This is attributable to significant dead space ventilation which has
   unfortunately progressed at this time.  This may be due to ineffective
   perfusion, overdistention of non-dependent lung units.  We have RR at a
   maximum at this time.  For his respiratory failure we will
   A)Hypoxemia
he will have PEEP titration today to determine optimal PEEP
   and hopefully allow some down titration of FIO2
   -Fent/Versed/Cisatra--at
 to allow passive support today
   -Will maintain FIO2 at 1.0
   -Will have to consider move to prone position if we are unable to
   maintain effective saturation with above measures.
   B)Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure-
   -This will have to be improved given severe acidemia
   -Will increase RR to 30 as possible
   -Will remove dead space from ventilatory circuit
   -Will have to increase tidal volume even though we will move beyond
   6cc/Kg given inability to maintain acceptable ventilation at this time
   -Will trial fluid bolus if are left with persistent and severe
   compromise of effective ventilation
   2)Shock-
   -Will need to evaluate CvO2 this morning to aid in confirmation of
   source of shock which at this point may well be a dominant finding of
   vasodilatory shock where what may have been a relative hypovolemic
   state at the onset.  In addition
we will need reasonable assessment of
   CVP at this time with a goal CVP of approximately 12 viewed as
   significant evidence against hypovolemic shock
   -Will check CvO2 to guide differential
   -Will send cultures for possible septic source if fever seen
   -Vasopressin 0.4-Levophed 0.45-Neo to continue
will look to correct pH
   as we can with ventilator and will utilize HCO3- as needed for blood
   pressure response
   -Will check ECG for possible myocardial ischemia
   -Do not see evidence of recurrent PE but is certainly of concern

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of lung cancer and admitted with a pulmonary embolism (PE) complicated by atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has had a significant worsening of his condition over the past 24 hours, leading to persistent and dense hypoxemic respiratory failure and severe shock.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Respiratory failure: Severe respiratory acidosis, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and persistent dead space ventilation.
* Shock: Vasodilatory shock likely secondary to compromise of the right heart SV in the setting of ARDS, with a goal CVP of approximately 12 to rule out hypovolemic shock.
* Atrial fibrillation (AFIB): Rate control as needed, with a current SR.
* Pulmonary embolism (PE): On Lovenox prophylaxis.
* Cancer (malignant neoplasm), lung: Will update primary oncology team in light of ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Pneumonia: Due to the prolonged use of invasive ventilation and the presence of dead space ventilation.
* Sepsis: Given the patient's history of cancer and the presence of vasodilatory shock, there is a risk of sepsis.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, and there is a risk of ventricular fibrillation or other arrhythmias.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further acidemia and hypercarbia.
* Shock: The patient's shock may worsen, leading to further compromise of organ perfusion and function.
* Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's ARDS may lead to pulmonary hypertension, which can further worsen his respiratory and cardiac status.

To address these potential complications, the patient will require close monitoring and management, including:

* PEEP titration to determine optimal PEEP and down titrate FIO2 as possible.
* Hypoxemia management, including the use of oxygen therapy and potential move to prone position.
* Hypercapnic respiratory failure management, including increasing RR, removing dead space from the ventilatory circuit, and increasing tidal volume.
* Shock management, including evaluation of CvO2, assessment of CVP, and potential fluid bolus.
* Atrial fibrillation management, including rate control as needed.
* Pulmonary embolism prophylaxis, including continued use of Lovenox.
* Cancer management, including updating the primary oncology team in light of ICU care.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU. The total time spent on the patient's care is 105 minutes."

   with large right PE who developed A. fib with RVR on admission and now
   with ARDS, on vent with shock requiring maximal pressors.
   1. Shock.  Cause of shock likely multifactorial.  Partly cardiogenic,
   [**12-21**] PE and now with with decreased pre load from positive pressure
   ventilation.  Also intermittently in atrial fibrillation with rates as
   high as 130, possibly contributing to poor output and shock. in Less
   likely hypovolemic, but given +9L yesterday.  Spiking fevers, likely
   septic component, blood cultures urine cultures sent, startedd on broac
   spectrum antibiotics.
   - mixed venous sat, if low
   - bolus LR prn
   - target MAP 65
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone IV 50mg
   - continue vanc/cefepime, add levofloxacin
   1.  ARDS
 hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Patient now intubated and
   paralyzed on LTVV, requiring FiO2 of 100%.
   - continue LTTV, increase PEEP and decrease FiO2 as tolerated, maxiumum
   plateau pressure of 30.
   - permissive hypercapnia
   2.  ARDS
 hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Patient becoming
   progressively more hypercarbic.
   - titrate up RR, TV as needed to reduce acidemia.
   - fluid bolus with LR
   - consider IV bicarb if continues to worsen
   .
   4. Pulmonary Embolism
   - continue lovenox
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, now in sinus tachycardia.
   Several episodes of SVT and afib with RVR yesterday, in the setting of
   severe respiratory distress
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   6. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Discuss goals with oncology given

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right PE who developed A. fib with RVR on admission and now
   with ARDS, on vent with shock requiring maximal pressors.
   1. Shock.  Cause of shock likely multifactorial.  Partly cardiogenic,
   [**12-21**] PE and now with with decreased pre load from positive pressure
   ventilation.  Also intermittently in atrial fibrillation with rates as
   high as 130, possibly contributing to poor output and shock. in Less
   likely hypovolemic, but given +9L yesterday.  Spiking fevers, likely
   septic component, blood cultures urine cultures sent, startedd on broac
   spectrum antibiotics.
   - mixed venous sat, if low
   - bolus LR prn
   - target MAP 65
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone IV 50mg
   - continue vanc/cefepime, add levofloxacin
   1.  ARDS
 hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Patient now intubated and
   paralyzed on LTVV, requiring FiO2 of 100%.
   - continue LTTV, increase PEEP and decrease FiO2 as tolerated, maxiumum
   plateau pressure of 30.
   - permissive hypercapnia
   2.  ARDS
 hypercarbic respiratory failure.  Patient becoming
   progressively more hypercarbic.
   - titrate up RR, TV as needed to reduce acidemia.
   - fluid bolus with LR
   - consider IV bicarb if continues to worsen
   .
   4. Pulmonary Embolism
   - continue lovenox
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, now in sinus tachycardia.
   Several episodes of SVT and afib with RVR yesterday, in the setting of
   severe respiratory distress
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor HR.
   .
   6. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Discuss goals with oncology given
   significant clinical deterioration.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

The patient, a 65-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), was admitted to the ICU with a large right pulmonary embolism (PE), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient is currently intubated and paralyzed on a ventilator, requiring high levels of oxygen and pressure support. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with increasing hypercarbia and acidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Shock: The patient's shock is likely multifactorial, partly cardiogenic, and partly due to decreased preload from positive pressure ventilation. The patient's intermittently elevated heart rate and atrial fibrillation may also contribute to poor output and shock.
2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS is characterized by hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure. The patient's FiO2 requirement is high, and the patient is at risk for further respiratory deterioration.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's pulmonary embolism is a significant risk factor for further complications, including respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and even death.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR is a significant risk factor for further cardiac complications, including stroke, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Hypercarbia: The patient's hypercarbia is a significant risk factor for further respiratory complications, including respiratory acidosis, and may also contribute to cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.
6. Infection: The patient's spiking fevers and positive blood cultures suggest a potential septic complication, which may further complicate the patient's condition.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's nasogastric tube placement and presence of a large pleural effusion may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, including aspiration and bleeding.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation, RVR, and shock may increase the risk of cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
9. Neurological Complications: The patient's presence of skeletal metastases and atrial fibrillation may increase the risk of neurological complications, including stroke and seizures.

Given the patient's complex and deteriorating condition, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

* The patient, a 65-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and EGFR mutation, is admitted to the ICU with large right pulmonary embolism (PE), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR).
* The patient's condition has deteriorated overnight, with ARDS, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and shock requiring maximal pressors.
* The patient is intubated and paralyzed on mechanical ventilation, requiring FiO2 of 100%.
* The patient has a history of NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and metastases to the spine, sternum, ribs, and basal ganglia.
* The patient has been screened for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib, but the goal of care has not been discussed with oncology.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Continued deterioration of ARDS, leading to further respiratory failure and potential need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest, given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and RVR.
4. Septic shock, despite the lack of evidence of infection, given the patient's critical status.
5. Pulmonary embolism progression or recurrence, potentially leading to further respiratory compromise and cardiovascular instability.
6. Nutritional deficiencies and electrolyte imbalances due to prolonged NPO status and potential gastrointestinal disturbances.
7. Infection, including bacteremia or sepsis, given the patient's compromised immune system and the presence of indwelling lines and tubes.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to stress ulcer disease or other underlying conditions.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Continued mechanical ventilation with permissive hypercapnia and titration of RR and TV as needed.
2. Fluid bolus with lactated Ringer's solution (LR) and consideration of IV bicarbonate if hypercapnia worsens.
3. Targeting mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 and weaning pressors as tolerated.
4. Continuing lovenox for pulmonary embolism.
5. Monitoring of heart rate and continuing 0.125 mg digoxin daily for atrial fibrillation with RVR.
6. Discussing goals of care with oncology and considering morphine for pain control.

Given the patient's critical condition, close monitoring and careful management of his respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic status are essential to prevent further complications and improve his outcome."

   65 yo male with stage IV lung cancer complicated by PE and now with
   severe ARDS and shock.  He has had ongoing efforts aimed at working for
   stabilization of his capacity to maintain adequate oxygenation and
   ventilation with ABG improved to this morning
   1)Respiratory Failure-This is a ARDS in the setting of existing PE and
   metastatic lung cancer which has shown some significant improvement in
   oxygenation and ventilation
   -Cistatracurium/Versed/Fentanyl
   -Wean FIO2 this morning
   -Continue Low Vt ventilation
will decrease to Vt=420 and keep RR at
   current levels
   -Maintain PEEP at current levels
   -Will discontinue paralytic agents at this time
   2)SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
He has substantial increase
   in volume support to 10 liters positive today and has had antibiotics
   started for vasodilatory state with high CvO2.  This morning he likely
   maintains a significant mixed picture with preload established as
   adequate but likely has a mixed picture of cardiogenic source and
   peristent vasodilatory state.
   -Levophed/Neo/Vasopressin
   -Vanco/Cefepime for possible infectious source
   -Will check CvO2 this morning
if it remains decreased
will move to
   inotrope for support
with cardiogenic source will have to consider
   possible recurrent insult with PE, Atrial Fibillation, myocardial
   stunning, myocardial supression in sepsis possible
   -If increased CvO2
will have to evaluate for alternative sources for
   persistent sepsis and do have concern for possible adrenal
   insufficiency and if increased or equivocal will move to test random
   cortisol and provide steroid replacment

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with stage IV lung cancer, pulmonary embolism (PE), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is receiving mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and antibiotics.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient has severe ARDS with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 115, which indicates significant improvement in oxygenation and ventilation.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has tachycardia, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation. He is receiving vasopressors to support his blood pressure.
* Hemodynamic status: The patient has a mixed picture of cardiogenic and vasodilatory shock, with a central venous oxygen saturation (CvO2) of 19%. He is receiving fluids and vasopressors to support his circulation.
* Neurological status: The patient is sedated and paralyzed, and his neurological status is not assessable.
* Laboratory results: The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.3 K/uL, a platelet count of 129 K/uL, and a lactate level of 5.5 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may worsen, leading to further deterioration in his respiratory status.
* Sepsis: The patient's mixed picture of cardiogenic and vasodilatory shock may indicate the presence of sepsis, which can lead to further organ dysfunction.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension may indicate cardiac complications, such as myocardial stunning or suppression.
* Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's mixed picture of cardiogenic and vasodilatory shock may indicate adrenal insufficiency, which can worsen his condition if left untreated.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient's PE may worsen, leading to further deterioration in his respiratory status and potentially life-threatening complications.
* Cancer progression: The patient's stage IV lung cancer may progress, leading to further deterioration in his overall condition.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan should be implemented:

* Continue mechanical ventilation and vasopressors to support the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status.
* Monitor the patient's CvO2 and adjust his vasopressor therapy accordingly.
* Consider cardioversion for the patient's atrial fibrillation if it persists and is causing hypotension.
* Monitor the patient's laboratory results and adjust his antibiotic therapy accordingly.
* Consider steroid replacement therapy if the patient's adrenal insufficiency is suspected.
* Monitor the patient's cancer progression and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
* Consider discharge planning for the patient once his condition improves and he is no longer requiring intensive care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 81-year-old male, is a critically ill patient in the ICU with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure, and sepsis. He was admitted with shortness of breath and has been receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 100% and PEEP of 12 cmH2O. His vital signs are stable, but he is febrile with a temperature of 102.2°F. His blood cultures are pending, and he has been started on antibiotics.

The patient has a history of cancer, and his CXR shows diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, likely due to pulmonary metastases. He has a left apical mass and moderate loculated left pleural effusion, which are consistent with his underlying cancer diagnosis.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, and his liver enzymes are elevated, consistent with sepsis. His electrolytes are within normal limits, but his albumin level is low.

The patient is being managed with mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and antibiotics. He is also receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis and has been placed on a DNR (do not resuscitate) status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to his underlying lung disease and pulmonary embolism. He may require further management with mechanical ventilation and bronchodilators.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to his underlying cancer and pulmonary embolism. He may require further management with antibiotics and supportive care.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension may indicate cardiovascular instability. He may require further management with vasopressors and anticoagulation.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate renal insufficiency. He may require further management with diuretics and fluid restriction.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's low albumin level may indicate nutritional deficiencies. He may require further management with nutritional supplements and enteral feeding.
6. Infection: The patient's febrile response and elevated white blood cell count may indicate infection. He may require further management with antibiotics and supportive care.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to address his multiple medical complications."

   FINDINGS: Support devices remain in standard position. Left apical
   mass,
   moderate loculated left pleural effusion, and widespread airspace
   opacities
   superimposed upon known pulmonary metastases do not appear appreciably
   changed
   in the short interval between the two studies. Small right pleural
   effusion
   also appears similar.

   FINDINGS: Orogastric tube has been placed and terminates in the region
   of the
   gastroduodenal junction. The exam otherwise appears similar to the
   recent
   study with persistent diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities, left apical
   mass,
   moderate left pleural effusion and widespread skeletal metastases.
   Known pulmonary metastases are partially obscured by the acute
   pulmonary process.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right PE who developed A. fib with RVR on admission and with
   ARDS, on ventilator with shock requiring maximum dose of 3 pressors.
   .
   1. Shock
 Now on maximal dose phenylephrine, norepinephrine and
   vasopressin, with MAPs in the 50s overnight.  Cause of shock is likely
   multifactorial.  Initially thought to be cardiogenic secondary to PE
   and decreased preload from positive pressure ventilation, with an
   element of hypovolemia, but he has not responded to aggressive fluid
   resuscitation, and his venous O2sat was 78% yesterday making other
   etiologies more likely.  As he has been spiking fevers, we are treating
   him for sepsis.  We started vanc/cefepime as empiric treatment for a
   pulmonary source.
   - recheck venous O2 sat, if low consider starting ionotropes
   (dobutamine), if not support BP with fluid vs additional pressors (epi
   vs. dopamine)
   - target MAP 60
   - continue vanc/cefepime
   - start levofloxacin
   - sputum culture, blood cultures, u/a, urine cultures.
   - stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone 50mg IV q6)
   - check LFTs, amylase lipase to look for further sings of shock (shock
   liver), possible causes (pancreatitis)
   2.  ARDS
 hypoxemia.  Patient now intubated and paralyzed on vent, on
   FiO2 of 100%, oxygenation improving
   - wean FiO2, repeat ABGs with vent changes
   3.  ARDS
 hypercarbia.  Also improved with high RR, Tv 450.
   - titrate down Tv, goal is ARDSnet LTTV
   - consider IV bicarb if continues to worsen
   .
   4. Pulmonary Embolism
   - continue heparin gtt
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, alternating b/w sinus tach
   and afib with rates 100-120.  Unclear how much afib is contribution to
   poor CO and shock.
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor dig level
   - consider cardioversion and amio load if HR increases
   - monitor HR.
   6. Acute Renal Failure.  Currently anuric, Cr up to 2.6, grossly fluid
   overloaded.  Likely [**12-21**] shock, systemic process.  If aggressive care is
   continued and he continues to be anuric, he will require hemodialysis.
   .
   7. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Discuss goals with oncology given
   significant clinical deterioration.
   - morphine for pain control
   8. Goals of care
 Respiratory status improving modestly, hemodynamic
   status deteriorating. Given persistent hypotension, likelihood of a
   return to baseline neurological status is low.  APACHE II score
   predicts inpatient mortality of > 87%.  Given family discussion
   yesterday. consider making patient [**Month/Day (2) 115**] and withdrawing care.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, a 65-year-old male with stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +), was admitted with a large right pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). He developed shock requiring maximum dose of three pressors and has been treated for sepsis. The patient has been intubated and paralyzed on a ventilator, with FiO2 of 100% and oxygenation improving. He has also been treated for ARDS with weaning of FiO2 and titration of TV.

The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple comorbidities, including NSCLC, pulmonary embolism, ARDS, atrial fibrillation, and acute renal failure. He is critically ill and has a high risk of mortality.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is being treated for sepsis, and further complications such as organ dysfunction, septic shock, or death can occur.
2. ARDS: The patient's ARDS is improving, but he may still experience respiratory failure, acute lung injury, or death.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to further complications such as stroke, cardiac arrest, or death.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, or death.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's pulmonary embolism may worsen, leading to further complications such as pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular failure, or death.
6. Shock: The patient's shock may worsen, leading to further complications such as organ dysfunction, septic shock, or death.
7. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state may increase the risk of infection, which can lead to further complications such as sepsis, organ dysfunction, or death.
8. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hemodynamic instability may worsen, leading to further complications such as cardiac arrest, stroke, or death.

The patient's prognosis is poor, with an APACHE II score predicting inpatient mortality of > 87%. Given the patient's persistent hypotension, likelihood of a return to baseline neurological status is low. The family meeting held yesterday discussed the possibility of making the patient DNR (do not resuscitate) and withdrawing care."

   devices remain in place. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications
   have
   somewhat decreased, especially in the upper zones. These are
   superimposed
   upon known pulmonary metastases.
   CXR [**1-31**] #2:
   FINDINGS: Support devices remain in standard position. Left apical
   mass,
   moderate loculated left pleural effusion, and widespread airspace
   opacities
   superimposed upon known pulmonary metastases do not appear appreciably
   changed
   in the short interval between the two studies. Small right pleural
   effusion
   also appears similar.
   CXR [**1-31**] #1:
   FINDINGS: Orogastric tube has been placed and terminates in the region
   of the
   gastroduodenal junction. The exam otherwise appears similar to the
   recent
   study with persistent diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities, left apical
   mass,
   moderate left pleural effusion and widespread skeletal metastases.
   Known pulmonary metastases are partially obscured by the acute
   pulmonary process.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right PE who developed A. fib with RVR on admission and with
   ARDS, on ventilator with shock requiring maximum dose of 3 pressors.
   .
   1. Shock
 Now on maximal dose phenylephrine, norepinephrine and
   vasopressin, with MAPs in the 50s overnight.  Cause of shock is likely
   multifactorial.  Initially thought to be cardiogenic secondary to PE
   and decreased preload from positive pressure ventilation, with an
   element of hypovolemia, but he has not responded to aggressive fluid

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Imaging: CXR [**2-1**]:
   FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**1-31**], the monitoring and
   support
   devices remain in place. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications
   have
   somewhat decreased, especially in the upper zones. These are
   superimposed
   upon known pulmonary metastases.
   CXR [**1-31**] #2:
   FINDINGS: Support devices remain in standard position. Left apical
   mass,
   moderate loculated left pleural effusion, and widespread airspace
   opacities
   superimposed upon known pulmonary metastases do not appear appreciably
   changed
   in the short interval between the two studies. Small right pleural
   effusion
   also appears similar.
   CXR [**1-31**] #1:
   FINDINGS: Orogastric tube has been placed and terminates in the region
   of the
   gastroduodenal junction. The exam otherwise appears similar to the
   recent
   study with persistent diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities, left apical
   mass,
   moderate left pleural effusion and widespread skeletal metastases.
   Known pulmonary metastases are partially obscured by the acute
   pulmonary process.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 65 yo M w/hx of stage IV NSCLC (EGFR mutation +)  admitted
   with large right PE who developed A. fib with RVR on admission and with
   ARDS, on ventilator with shock requiring maximum dose of 3 pressors.
   .
   1. Shock
 Now on maximal dose phenylephrine, norepinephrine and
   vasopressin, with MAPs in the 50s overnight.  Cause of shock is likely
   multifactorial.  Initially thought to be cardiogenic secondary to PE
   and decreased preload from positive pressure ventilation, with an
   element of hypovolemia, but he has not responded to aggressive fluid
   resuscitation, and his venous O2sat was 78% yesterday making other
   etiologies more likely.  As he has been spiking fevers, we are treating
   him for sepsis.  We started vanc/cefepime as empiric treatment for a
   pulmonary source.
   - recheck venous O2 sat, if low consider starting ionotropes
   (dobutamine), if not support BP with fluid vs additional pressors (epi
   vs. dopamine)
   - target MAP 60
   - continue vanc/cefepime
   - start levofloxacin
   - sputum culture, blood cultures, u/a, urine cultures.
   - stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone 50mg IV q6)
   - check LFTs, amylase lipase to look for further sings of shock (shock
   liver), possible causes (pancreatitis)
   2.  ARDS
 hypoxemia.  Patient now intubated and paralyzed on vent, on
   FiO2 of 100%, oxygenation improving
   - wean FiO2, repeat ABGs with vent changes
   3.  ARDS
 hypercarbia.  Also improved with high RR, Tv 450.
   - titrate down Tv, goal is ARDSnet LTTV
   - consider IV bicarb if continues to worsen
   .
   4. Pulmonary Embolism
   - continue heparin gtt
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR.  On dig, alternating b/w sinus tach
   and afib with rates 100-120.  Unclear how much afib is contribution to
   poor CO and shock.
   - continue 0.125 mg digoxin daily.
   - monitor dig level
   - consider cardioversion and amio load if HR increases
   - monitor HR.
   6. Acute Renal Failure.  Currently anuric, Cr up to 2.6, grossly fluid
   overloaded.  Likely [**12-21**] shock, systemic process.  If aggressive care is
   continued and he continues to be aneuric, he will require hemodialysis.
   .
   7. NSCLC.  Patient NSCLC with primary left apical lesion and mets to
   the spine, sternum, ribs and basal ganglia.  Patient has been  screened
   for DFHCC 09-210, erlotinib.  Discuss goals with oncology given
   significant clinical deterioration.
   - morphine for pain control
   8. Goals of care
 Respiratory status improving modestly, hemodynamic
   status deteriorating. Given persistent hypotension, likelihood of a
   return to baseline neurological status is low.  APACHE II score
   predicts inpatient mortality of > 87%.  Given family discussion
   yesterday, consider making patient [**Month/Day (2) 115**] and withdrawing care.

Summary:

The patient, a 65-year-old male with stage IV NSCLC, was admitted to the ICU with a large right pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and shock. He has been treated with vasopressors, antibiotics, and anticoagulation therapy. Despite improvements in oxygenation, he remains in shock, anuric, and has acute renal failure. His APACHE II score predicts inpatient mortality of > 87%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fevers, hypotension, and tachycardia suggest sepsis, which may be contributing to his shock and acute renal failure.
2. ARDS: The patient's hypoxemia and hypercarbia are likely due to ARDS, which may worsen if not managed appropriately.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's large right pulmonary embolism may be contributing to his shock and hypotension.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR may be contributing to his poor cardiac output and shock.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's anuria and elevated creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure, which may be due to shock, sepsis, or other underlying conditions.
6. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's persistent hypotension and requirement for multiple vasopressors suggest hemodynamic instability, which may be due to sepsis, ARDS, or other underlying conditions.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's requirement for mechanical ventilation and high FiO2 suggests respiratory failure, which may worsen if not managed appropriately.
8. Infection: The patient's fevers and elevated white blood cell count suggest infection, which may be contributing to his sepsis and acute renal failure.
9. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and potential for return to baseline neurological status are low, which may be due to his underlying medical conditions or complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue empiric treatment for sepsis with antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.
2. Wean FiO2 and titrate down TV to achieve ARDSnet LTTV.
3. Monitor digoxin levels and consider cardioversion and amiodarone load if HR increases.
4. Continue hemodynamic support with vasopressors and consider hemodialysis if anuria persists.
5. Consider stress dose steroids to look for further signs of shock (shock liver) and possible causes (pancreatitis).
6. Monitor LFTs and amylase/lipase to look for further signs of shock and potential causes.
7. Consider IV bicarb if hypercarbia worsens.
8. Discuss goals of care with oncology and consider making the patient DNR (do not resuscitate) given his significant clinical deterioration and predicted inpatient mortality."
