 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   This is a 68 yo M with extensive Hx of hospitalization for COPD
   exacerbation as well as multiple lower GI bleeds admitted for
   hematochezia.
   .
   # Hematochezia: likely diverticular bleed given history of signficant
   diverticula.  He has had 1 prior hospitalization for a lower GI bleed
   in [**2-14**] for which only sources identified on scope were diverticula.
   Other potential etiologies include internal hemorrhoids.  Colonic mass
   is less likely given multiple prior scopes in past 9 years. Upper GI
   bleed less likely given absence of melena and clear NGL.  Is on chronic
   steroids so is at risk for gastritis. Given no prior source
   definitively identified previously, small bowel sources are also
   possible.
   -Has CVL in place as well as PIVs for recusitation
   -Q6 Hct today
   -IV PPI for now, given pt's steroid use should likely be on [**Hospital1 **] oral
   PPI at home.
   -Stool cx given crampy pain with bloody stool r/o infectious

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleed, likely diverticular bleed given his history of significant diverticula. He has had a prior hospitalization for a lower GI bleed and is currently on chronic steroids, which puts him at risk for gastritis. The patient is receiving IV PPI and has had stool cx to rule out infectious colitis/dysentery. He is being considered for outpatient vs inpatient surgical evaluation for partial colectomy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 109/55 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula. His physical examination is notable for decreased air exchange, a skin tear on the dorsum of his right hand, and fresh blood in the perirectal area.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.5, hemoglobin of 28.6 g/dL, platelet count of 312 K/uL, and creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL. His calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: Given the patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleed, there is a risk of hemorrhagic shock if the bleeding is not controlled.
2. Infection: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed may be secondary to an underlying infection, such as infectious colitis or dysentery.
3. Gastritis: The patient's chronic steroid use puts him at risk for gastritis, which may worsen his gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Diverticulitis: The patient's history of diverticula and ongoing bleeding increases his risk of developing diverticulitis.
5. Intestinal obstruction: The patient's diverticula may lead to intestinal obstruction, which could worsen his symptoms and increase his risk of complications.
6. Sepsis: The patient's underlying medical conditions, including his chronic steroid use and gastrointestinal bleed, increase his risk of developing sepsis.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increases his risk of respiratory failure, particularly if he experiences respiratory distress or hypoxia.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's underlying cardiovascular disease and chronic steroid use increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure."

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding, likely due to diverticula. He has a history of hospitalization for COPD exacerbation and multiple lower GI bleeds. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antacids, and pain management medications. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 109/55 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is notable for decreased air exchange in the lungs, but no wheezes or rhonchi. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, with normal bowel sounds. He has a skin tear on the dorsum of his right hand and fresh blood in the perirectal area.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 15.5, hemoglobin of 28.6, and platelet count of 312. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient is at risk for further bleeding due to his underlying diverticula and potential small bowel sources.
2. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to his chronic steroid use, making him more susceptible to infection.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and decreased air exchange in the lungs may lead to respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but his chronic steroid use and potential infection may lead to cardiac complications.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged NPO status may lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis due to his immobility and chronic steroid use.
7. Stress ulceration: The patient's prolonged NPO status and chronic steroid use may lead to stress ulceration.
8. Gastrointestinal perforation: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and chronic steroid use may lead to gastrointestinal perforation.

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely.
2. Maintain the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels within normal limits.
3. Consider switching to a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to PO to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Discuss the utility of repeat scope vs. possible capsule study with the patient and family.
5. Hold aspirin until further bleeding has stopped.
6. Consider outpatient surgical evaluation for evaluation for partial colectomy.
7. Continue COPD management with home dose steroids, tiotropium, and prn albuterol nebs.
8. Maintain glycemic control and consider adding stress ulcer prophylaxis if necessary."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a multi-lumen IJ line, which was discontinued due to a pneumothorax on the left side. The patient experienced a 16-second Vtach and reported chest tightness and shortness of breath (SOB). The symptoms resolved with nebs and EKG, cardiac enzymes, and lytes. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the pneumothorax, which resolved on a subsequent CXR.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 36.7°C (98.1°F), HR of 81 bpm, BP of 98/51 mmHg, RR of 18 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is in sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results show:

* WBC: 15.5-12.6 K/uL
* Hct: 28.6-23.8%
* Plt: Not reported
* Cr: 0.6-0.8 mg/dL
* TropT: <0.01
* Glucose: 108-84 mg/dL

The patient has a history of Levaquin allergy and is taking various medications, including albuterol, fentanyl, insulin, and prednisone.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer prophylaxis or other causes
* Pneumothorax recurrence
* Respiratory failure due to hyperinflation and lung injury
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or MI, due to the patient's cardiac history
* Infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Hemodynamic instability due to fluid imbalance or cardiac issues
* Neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, due to hypoxia or other causes

The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is unknown. Further monitoring and management are necessary to address these potential complications and ensure the patient's safety and well-being."

 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   This is a 68 yo M with extensive Hx of hospitalization for COPD
   exacerbation as well as multiple lower GI bleeds admitted for
   hematochezia.
   .
   # Hematochezia: likely diverticular bleed given history of signficant
   diverticula.  He has had 1 prior hospitalization for a lower GI bleed
   in [**2-14**] for which only sources identified on scope were diverticula.
   Other potential etiologies include internal hemorrhoids.  Colonic mass
   is less likely given multiple prior scopes in past 9 years. Upper GI
   bleed less likely given absence of melena and clear NGL.  Is on chronic
   steroids so is at risk for gastritis. Given no prior source
   definitively identified previously, small bowel sources are also
   possible.
   - Has PIVs in place.
   - continue Q12H Hcts
   - PPI switched to home PO dose.
   -GI involvement appreciated. Bleeding scan if rebleeds to determine
   possible resection site.
   - If hemodynamic instability or large bleed, call surgery and IR for
   urgent eval and angiography/coil vs surger
   -Hold aspirin given bleed
   .
   # COPD. At baseline. Continue home dose steroids, tiotropium, prn
   albuterol nebs.  Continue calcium, vitamin D and alendronate.
   .
   # FEN: regular diet.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Hematochezia: likely diverticular bleed given history of signficant
   diverticula.  He has had 1 prior hospitalization for a lower GI bleed
   in [**2-14**] for which only sources identified on scope were diverticula.
   Other potential etiologies include internal hemorrhoids.  Colonic mass
   is less likely given multiple prior scopes in past 9 years. Upper GI
   bleed less likely given absence of melena and clear NGL.  Is on chronic

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU for hematochezia, likely due to a diverticular bleed. He has a history of hospitalization for COPD exacerbation and multiple lower GI bleeds. The patient is on chronic steroids, which increases his risk for gastritis.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 98/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery, and his ABG results show a pH of 7.34, pCO2 of 34 mmHg, and pO2 of 95 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 7.4 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 28.6%
* Platelet count: 250 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 15.5 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 108 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes COPD, diverticula, and prior lower GI bleeds. He is at risk for gastritis due to chronic steroid use.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Rebleeding: The patient's diverticular bleed may reoccur, which could lead to further hemodynamic instability and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Infection: The patient's chronic steroid use and hospitalization increase his risk for infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
3. Gastrointestinal perforation: The patient's diverticular bleed may lead to perforation of the gastrointestinal tract, which could result in peritonitis and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and chronic steroid use increase his risk for respiratory failure, which could lead to mechanical ventilation and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's chronic steroid use and hospitalization increase his risk for cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias and myocardial infarction.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
2. Continue to manage his COPD exacerbation with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy.
3. Consider endoscopy to identify the source of bleeding and potentially treat it.
4. Monitor the patient's laboratory results, including his hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, to ensure that they are within a safe range.
5. Consider antibiotic therapy if the patient develops signs of infection.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his oxygen therapy accordingly.
7. Consider cardiac monitoring to identify potential cardiovascular complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of hospitalization for COPD exacerbation and multiple lower GI bleeds, currently admitted for hematochezia. The patient has been experiencing symptoms of pain in the throat, which was described as ""tightness"" and shortness of breath, and had a 16-second V-tach episode. An electrocardiogram (EKG) and cardiac enzymes were ordered, and the patient was started on nebulizers. The patient's symptoms resolved quickly, and the EKG and enzymes were negative for an MI.

The patient was found to have a small left apical pneumothorax on a chest X-ray (CXR), which was resolved by the second CXR. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 98/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and decreased platelet count (Plt). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, and the troponin-T level is less than 0.01 ng/mL.

The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diverticula, and a prior hospitalization for a lower GI bleed. The patient is at risk for gastritis due to chronic steroids and has a history of multiple lower GI bleeds.

The patient's current diagnosis is a gastrointestinal bleed, likely diverticular, and the plan is to continue Q12H Hcts, switch to home PO dose of PPI, and perform a bleeding scan if rebleeds occur. If hemodynamic instability or large bleed occurs, the patient will be evaluated by surgery and interventional radiology for urgent evaluation and angiography/coil versus surgery.

The patient's other medical conditions include COPD, which is being managed with home dose steroids, tiotropium, and prn albuterol nebs, and fen, which is being managed with a regular diet.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's bleeding can lead to hypovolemic shock, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
2. Infection: The patient's diverticula and prior hospitalization for a lower GI bleed increase the risk of infection.
3. Gastritis: The patient's chronic steroids and history of gastritis increase the risk of gastritis.
4. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD can exacerbate if not managed properly.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient's history of COPD and hospitalization increase the risk of thromboembolic events.

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition closely to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   This is a 68 yo M with extensive Hx of hospitalization for COPD
   exacerbation as well as multiple lower GI bleeds admitted for
   hematochezia.
   .
   # Hematochezia: likely diverticular bleed given history of signficant
   diverticula.  He has had 1 prior hospitalization for a lower GI bleed
   in [**2-14**] for which only sources identified on scope were diverticula.
   Other potential etiologies include internal hemorrhoids.  Colonic mass
   is less likely given multiple prior scopes in past 9 years. Upper GI
   bleed less likely given absence of melena and clear NGL.  Is on chronic
   steroids so is at risk for gastritis. Given no prior source
   definitively identified previously, small bowel sources are also
   possible.
   - Has PIV in place, please place second
   - continue Q12H Hcts
   - PPI switched to home PO dose.
   -GI involvement appreciated. Bleeding scan if rebleeds to determine
   possible resection site.
   - If hemodynamic instability or large bleed, call surgery and IR for
   urgent eval and angiography/coil vs surger
   -Hold aspirin given bleed
   -though Hct low today, repeat was higher and stable.  Will recheck this
   pm.  If <21, will transfuse.  If stable, will c/o.
   .
   # NSVT: enzymes and ekg WNL, continue to monitor on tele.
   [**Hospital 9641**] medical chart for history of VT
   -possibly due to spontaneous pneumothorax from ?bleb rupture but
   unclear if there was actually a pneumo since it was not apparent on f/u
   CXR; will contact radiology today
   .
   # COPD. At baseline. Continue home dose steroids, tiotropium, prn
   albuterol nebs.  Continue calcium, vitamin D and alendronate.
   .
   # FEN: regular diet.

Summary:

The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding, specifically hematochezia. He has a history of COPD exacerbation and multiple lower GI bleeds. The patient's hematochezia is likely due to a diverticular bleed, but other potential etiologies include internal hemorrhoids and gastritis. He is on chronic steroids, which puts him at risk for gastritis.

The patient had a 16-second ventricular tachycardia (VT) episode with chest tightness and shortness of breath (SOB) on July 21, 2021, at 8:19 PM. He was treated with nebs and got an EKG, cardiac enzymes, and electrolyte levels. The SOB and chest tightness quickly resolved. A pneumothorax on the left side was detected on a chest X-ray, which resolved on a subsequent X-ray.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.1°F, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, blood pressure of 98/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -340 mL, and his laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but slightly elevated creatinine and troponin-T levels.

The patient's plan includes:

* Placement of a second PIV line
* Continue Q12H Hcts
* Switching to a home PO dose of PPI
* Bleeding scan if rebleeds to determine possible resection site
* Hold aspirin given bleed
* Repeat Hct and transfuse if <21
* Continue to monitor on tele for NSVT
* Contact radiology to clarify spontaneous pneumothorax
* Continue home dose steroids, tiotropium, prn albuterol nebs, calcium, vitamin D, and alendronate
* Regular diet
* ICU care, including prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer, and monitoring for VAP

Potential medical complications:

* Hemodynamic instability due to gastrointestinal bleeding
* Large bleed requiring urgent evaluation and angiography/coil or surgery
* Spontaneous pneumothorax recurrence
* Development of a colonic mass or internal hemorrhoids
* Gastritis due to chronic steroid use
* COPD exacerbation
* Nutritional deficiencies due to gastrointestinal bleeding and malabsorption
* Infection due to prolonged ICU stay and immunosuppression"
