You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male who presented with cardiogenic shock due to biliary obstruction and underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting. The patient was placed on a balloon pump and was weaned off levophed, with dopamine being increased to 7.5mcg/kg/hr to maintain a MAP > 70.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
* Heart rate: 86 bpm (78-149 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 87/64 mmHg (77-103/69 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 17 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 97%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 14 mmHg (10-26 mmHg), PAP 50/31 mmHg, CO/CI 5.8 L/min/3.3 L/min/m2, SvO2 74%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 22.4-15.2 K/uL
* Hct: 27.9-26.2%
* Plt: 1882-108 K/uL
* Cr: 1.3-1.2 mg/dL

* LDH: 1228 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.0 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.4 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Intubated and sedated
* NCAT, sclera anicteric, pupils constricted
* Difficult to assess JVP with central line in place
* RR, balloon pump masks heart sounds but no clear murmurs
* Soft abdomen, large operative scar with staples, active bile drainage from surgical site
* No stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas
* No c/c/e, no femoral bruits

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continue with balloon pump
* Wean off levafed as tolerated
* Add dopamine/dobutamine as needed if MAP < 60
* Hold antihypertensives
* Continue with sepsis work-up given severe WBC; send another blood culture, urine culture
* Continue with vanc/zosyn for now
* Aspirin/plavix for coronaries
* Hold beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
* Continue with mechanical ventilation
* Continue with vanc/zosyn for now
* Trend daily LFTs

   CXR -
   There is again seen diffuse
   airspace opacities throughout both lung fields which have improved
   slightly
   since the previous study. There is no large pleural effusions. A new
   intra-
   aortic balloon pump is identified.
   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p MI and likely
   sepsis.
   .
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.
   Patient continues to be in shock which is likely multifactorial: both
   cardiac (hypotension, wedge in 30s in cath lab, but CI of 2.3) and
   septic (SVR in 700->800 range).   Now off levaphed, and on increased
   dose of dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some decrease in
   afterload and mild increase in DBP.  Cardiac contractility impaired
   likely due ot myocardial stunning as well as MI.  Pt. is also ~ 1.8L
   positive o/n, which is contributing to impaired forward flow, CVP is
   14, thus preload should be adequate.
   - Continue with balloon pump
   - Continue w/ dopamine with goal of MAP<65, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Will start lasix gtt given labile BPs w/ goal UOP of 100-150cc, >
   -1L.
   - Obtain SVR, CI/CO Q8hrs to reassess cardiac function and wean off
   IABP
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
   # ID.  Septic Shock.  Given fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC
   (now slightly improved) and ARDS type picture clinically and on XR
   (although can not technically designate as ARDS in setting of elevated
   PCWP), patient likely septic w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to
   pulmonary to urinary.  CXR most consistent w/ ARDS, this may be likely
   [**2-27**] aspiration given the rapid time course of events.  Tx for possible
   PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus
   also will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR
   and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT.  UA from this AM negative.   Line infection also a
   possibility, as R IJ placed on [**1-5**].
   -          Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn
   -          Sputum smear and Cx.
   -          Consider pulling R central line if fevers and septic picture
   persists.
   -          Surveillance BCx, f/u current Cx.
   -          Obtain vanco trough tomorrow AM.
   .
   # CORONARIES: 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes
   peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   Current CK 1882.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   .
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Likely [**2-27**] ARDS, vs multifocal PNA vs.
   aspiration pneumonitis.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn for now
   .
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are unchanged, though Tbili is
   decreasing.  Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of
   infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - Surgery following now that in CCU
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn
   .
   # ARF.  Likely [**2-27**] shock/pre-renal state.
   -          Will monitor Cr as will be diuresing.  This may improve as
   CO improves.
   # ANEMIA. HCT 27 was 41 on admission.  Decreased significantly post OR
   on [**1-5**].  Currently stable, likely [**2-27**] dilution and OR losses.
   Currently /w nl O2sat on 60% FiO2.
   - Would  transfuse w/ goal of HCT >=30 given ischemia.
   .
   # S/P TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.
   -          Continue cellcept and prograf
   -          F/u tacro level.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CXR -
   There is again seen diffuse
   airspace opacities throughout both lung fields which have improved
   slightly
   since the previous study. There is no large pleural effusions. A new
   intra-
   aortic balloon pump is identified.
   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p MI and likely
   sepsis.
   .
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.
   Patient continues to be in shock which is likely multifactorial: both
   cardiac (hypotension, wedge in 30s in cath lab, but CI of 2.3) and
   septic (SVR in 700->800 range).   Now off levaphed, and on increased
   dose of dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some decrease in
   afterload and mild increase in DBP.  Cardiac contractility impaired
   likely due ot myocardial stunning as well as MI.  Pt. is also ~ 1.8L
   positive o/n, which is contributing to impaired forward flow, CVP is
   14, thus preload should be adequate.
   - Continue with balloon pump
   - Continue w/ dopamine with goal of MAP<65, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Will start lasix gtt given labile BPs w/ goal UOP of 100-150cc, >
   -1L.
   - Obtain SVR, CI/CO Q8hrs to reassess cardiac function and wean off
   IABP
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
   # ID.  Septic Shock.  Given fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC
   (now slightly improved) and ARDS type picture clinically and on XR
   (although can not technically designate as ARDS in setting of elevated
   PCWP), patient likely septic w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to
   pulmonary to urinary.  CXR most consistent w/ ARDS, this may be likely
   [**2-27**] aspiration given the rapid time course of events.  Tx for possible
   PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus
   also will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR
   and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT.  UA from this AM negative.   Line infection also a
   possibility, as R IJ placed on [**1-5**].
   -          Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn
   -          Sputum smear and Cx.
   -          Consider pulling R central line if fevers and septic picture
   persists.
   -          Surveillance BCx, f/u current Cx.
   -          Obtain vanco trough tomorrow AM.
   .
   # CORONARIES: 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes
   peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   Current CK 1882.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   .
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Likely [**2-27**] ARDS, vs multifocal PNA vs.
   aspiration pneumonitis.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn for now
   .
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are unchanged, though Tbili is
   decreasing.  Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of
   infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - Surgery following now that in CCU
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn
   .
   # ARF.  Likely [**2-27**] shock/pre-renal state.
   -          Will monitor Cr as will be diuresing.  This may improve as

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), Hepatitis C, and Liver Transplant (OLT). He presented with cardiogenic shock, septic shock, and respiratory failure. He underwent emergency ERCP and Roux-en-Y hepatic jejunostomy, followed by cardiac catheterization, which revealed 3-vessel disease (3VD) with left anterior descending (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA) stenting. He is currently on a balloon pump, dopamine, and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's condition is complex, with multiple organ dysfunction:

1. Cardiac: Cardiogenic shock, likely due to myocardial stunning and MI, with severely depressed EF and severe anterior hypo/akinesis.
2. Respiratory: ARDS-like picture, with diffuse airspace opacities on CXR, and possible aspiration pneumonitis or multifocal PNA.
3. Infectious: Septic shock, with fevers, hypotension, and elevated WBC, likely due to intra-abdominal, pulmonary, or urinary sources.
4. Renal: Acute kidney injury (AKI), likely due to shock and pre-renal state.
5. Hematological: Anemia, with HCT 27, likely due to dilution and OR losses.
6. Gastrointestinal: Biliary obstruction, with anastomotic stricture, and possible intra-abdominal infection.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac: Continued cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, and possible cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory: Further respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or pneumonia.
3. Infectious: Worsening sepsis, possible line infection, and opportunistic infections.
4. Renal: Further AKI, chronic kidney disease (CKD), or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
5. Hematological: Prolonged anemia, bleeding complications, or thrombocytopenia.
6. Gastrointestinal: Worsening biliary obstruction, possible cholangitis, or perforation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue balloon pump and dopamine to support cardiac function.
2. Monitor and wean off IABP as tolerated by BPs.
3. Continue sepsis work-up, including CXR, sputum smear, and Cx, and consider pulling R central line if fevers and septic picture persist.
4. Obtain vanco trough tomorrow AM and continue empiric treatment for HCAP with vanco/zosyn.
5. Trend daily LFTs, and consider surgery following to address biliary obstruction.
6. Monitor Cr and consider diuresis to improve renal function.
7. Consider transfusion to achieve HCT >=30 given ischemia.
8. Continue cellcept and prograf, and follow up with transplant team.
9. Monitor and manage pain, DVT prophylaxis, and bowel regimen.

This patient requires close monitoring and management to address the complex organ dysfunction and potential medical complications."

   Chief Complaint:
   52M with history of Hep C and HCC s/p OLT here with biliary
   obstruction, now presenting with ? of cardigenic vs septic shock s/p
   cath showing 3VD with 2 stents and an intraaortic balloon pump placed
   on dopamine.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's levophed was weaned off overnight and his dopamine was
   increased.  He self-extubated himself this am and was reintubated after
   he desated to the 80's.  He was started on a lasix gtt (with a goal of
   [**1-27**] L negative) and has been on a heparin gtt given the balloon pump.
   His balloon pump was advanced slightly today.  Fluconazole started per
   transplant surgery.  Patient getting an abdominal US to evaluate for
   fluid collection which showed (via prelim read) no large perihepatic
   fluid collection and a small right pleural effusion.  He woke up from
   sedation (although the sedation was unchanged) and tried to sit up
   during the day so his sedation was increased and he was placed in
   restraints given his groin lines.  His Hct check in the afternoon
   showed a 3 point Hct drop from 26.2 to 23.1.  We wanted to transfuse
   him a unit of PRBC, however he did not have a blood consent on the
   chart and his health care proxy could not be reached by phone.  On
   recheck it was 23.1, so it was decided that as he was stable to defer
   blood transfusion until consent could be received.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   52M with history of Hep C and HCC s/p OLT here with biliary
   obstruction, now presenting with ? of cardigenic vs septic shock s/p
   cath showing 3VD with 2 stents and an intraaortic balloon pump placed
   on dopamine.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's levophed was weaned off overnight and his dopamine was
   increased.  He self-extubated himself this am and was reintubated after
   he desated to the 80's.  He was started on a lasix gtt (with a goal of
   [**1-27**] L negative) and has been on a heparin gtt given the balloon pump.
   His balloon pump was advanced slightly today.  Fluconazole started per
   transplant surgery.  Patient getting an abdominal US to evaluate for
   fluid collection which showed (via prelim read) no large perihepatic
   fluid collection and a small right pleural effusion.  He woke up from
   sedation (although the sedation was unchanged) and tried to sit up
   during the day so his sedation was increased and he was placed in
   restraints given his groin lines.  His Hct check in the afternoon
   showed a 3 point Hct drop from 26.2 to 23.1.  We wanted to transfuse
   him a unit of PRBC, however he did not have a blood consent on the
   chart and his health care proxy could not be reached by phone.  On
   recheck it was 23.1, so it was decided that as he was stable to defer
   blood transfusion until consent could be received.

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p MI and likely
   sepsis.
   .
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.
   Patient continues to be in shock which is likely multifactorial: both
   cardiac (hypotension, wedge in 30s in cath lab, but CI of 2.3) and
   septic (SVR in 700->800 range).   Now off levaphed, and on increased
   dose of dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some decrease in
   afterload and mild increase in DBP.  Cardiac contractility impaired
   likely due ot myocardial stunning as well as MI.  Pt. is also ~ 1.8L
   positive o/n, which is contributing to impaired forward flow, CVP is
   14, thus preload should be adequate.
   - Continue with balloon pump
   - Continue w/ dopamine with goal of MAP<65, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Will start lasix gtt given labile BPs w/ goal UOP of 100-150cc, >
   -1L.
   - Obtain SVR, CI/CO Q8hrs to reassess cardiac function and wean off
   IABP
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
   # ID.  Septic Shock.  Given fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC
   (now slightly improved) and ARDS type picture clinically and on XR
   (although can not technically designate as ARDS in setting of elevated
   PCWP), patient likely septic w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to
   pulmonary to urinary.  CXR most consistent w/ ARDS, this may be likely
   [**2-27**] aspiration given the rapid time course of events.  Tx for possible
   PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus
   also will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR
   and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT.  UA from this AM negative.   Line infection also a
   possibility, as R IJ placed on [**1-5**].
   -          Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) who underwent an Orthotopic Liver Transplant (OLT) and is currently experiencing shock, likely due to a combination of cardiac and septic factors.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Shock: The patient is in shock, which is likely multifactorial, with both cardiac and septic components. The cardiac component is attributed to hypotension, wedge pressure in the 30s, and impaired cardiac contractility due to myocardial stunning and MI. The septic component is suspected due to fever, hypotension, and low systemic vascular resistance (SVR).
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a 3-vessel disease (3VD) with stenting of the left anterior descending (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA). Enzymes peaked at 2260, with CKMB at 108 and MBI at 5.7. Current CK is 1882.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing ARDS, multifocal PNA, or aspiration pneumonitis, which is being treated with mechanical ventilation and antibiotics.
4. Biliary obstruction: The patient has an anastomotic stricture, which is being treated with antibiotics and surgery.
5. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient is likely experiencing shock/pre-renal state, which is being monitored.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (HCT) has decreased significantly since admission and is currently stable.
7. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis, with sources ranging from intra-abdominal, pulmonary, or urinary.
8. Immunosuppression: The patient is immunosuppressed due to the transplant, which increases the risk of opportunistic infections.

The patient is currently receiving the following treatments:

1. Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)
2. Dopamine
3. Lasix gtt
4. Heparin gtt
5. Vancomycin and Zosyn for sepsis
6. Fentanyl for pain management
7. Cellcept and Prograf for transplant
8. Prophylactic anticoagulation for DVT

The patient's labs are showing:

1. Elevated white blood cell count (WBC)
2. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
3. Elevated creatinine (Cr)
4. Elevated liver enzymes (LFTs)
5. Decreased hemoglobin (HCT)
6. Elevated troponin-T

The patient's vital signs are:

1. Temperature: 37.2°C
2. Heart rate: 71 bpm
3. Blood pressure: 88/61 mmHg
4. Respiratory rate: 18 breaths/min
5. Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

1. Intubated and sedated
2. Difficult to assess jugular venous pressure (JVP) due to central line
3. Soft abdomen with active bile drainage from the surgical site
4. No femoral bruits or pedal edema

The patient's medical history is significant for:

1. Hepatitis C
2. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC)
3. Orthotopic Liver Transplant (OLT)
4. Cardiac disease (3VD)

The patient's current condition is unstable, and close monitoring is necessary to address the underlying causes of shock and sepsis."

   He received a dose of 5 mg metolazone overnight and his lasix gtt was
   increased to 15 mg/hr.  His balloon pump was advanced slightly today.
   Fluconazole started per transplant surgery.  Patient had an abdominal
   US to evaluate for fluid collection which showed no large perihepatic
   fluid collection and a small right pleural effusion.  He woke up from
   sedation (although the sedation was unchanged) and tried to sit up

   This am the patient had a short episode of hypotension so his balloon
   was put to 1:1 (from 1:2) and his lasix gtt was stopped.

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p MI and likely
   sepsis.
   .
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.
   Patient continues to be in shock which is likely multifactorial: both
   cardiac (hypotension, wedge in 30s in cath lab, but CI of 2.3) and
   septic (SVR in 700->800 range).   Now off levaphed, and on increased
   dose of dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some decrease in
   afterload and mild increase in DBP.  Cardiac contractility impaired
   likely due ot myocardial stunning as well as MI.  Pt. is also ~ 1.8L
   positive o/n, which is contributing to impaired forward flow, CVP is
   14, thus preload should be adequate.
   - Continue with balloon pump
   - Continue w/ dopamine with goal of MAP<65, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Will start lasix gtt given labile BPs w/ goal UOP of 100-150cc, >
   -1L.
   - Obtain SVR, CI/CO Q8hrs to reassess cardiac function and wean off
   IABP
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
   # ID.  Septic Shock.  Given fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC
   (now slightly improved) and ARDS type picture clinically and on XR
   (although can not technically designate as ARDS in setting of elevated
   PCWP), patient likely septic w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to
   pulmonary to urinary.  CXR most consistent w/ ARDS, this may be likely
   [**2-27**] aspiration given the rapid time course of events.  Tx for possible
   PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus
   also will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR
   and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT.  UA from this AM negative.   Line infection also a
   possibility, as R IJ placed on [**1-5**].
   -          Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn
   -          Sputum smear and Cx.
   -          Consider pulling R central line if fevers and septic picture
   persists.
   -          Surveillance BCx, f/u current Cx.
   -          Obtain vanco trough tomorrow AM.
   .
   # CORONARIES: 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes
   peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   Current CK 1882.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   .
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Likely [**2-27**] ARDS, vs multifocal PNA vs.
   aspiration pneumonitis.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn for now
   .
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are unchanged, though Tbili is
   decreasing.  Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of
   infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - Surgery following now that in CCU
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn
   .
   # ARF.  Likely [**2-27**] shock/pre-renal state.
   -          Will monitor Cr as will be diuresing.  This may improve as
   CO improves.
   # ANEMIA. HCT 27 was 41 on admission.  Decreased significantly post OR
   on [**1-5**].  Currently stable, likely [**2-27**] dilution and OR losses.
   Currently /w nl O2sat on 60% FiO2.
   - Would  transfuse w/ goal of HCT >=30 given ischemia.
   .
   # S/P TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.
   -          Continue cellcept and prograf
   -          F/u tacro level.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   52M with history of Hep C and HCC s/p OLT here with biliary
   obstruction, now presenting with ? of cardiogenic vs septic shock s/p
   cath showing 3VD with 2 stents and an intraaortic balloon pump placed
   on dopamine.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's levophed was weaned off overnight and his dopamine was
   increased.  He self-extubated himself this am and was reintubated after
   he desated to the 80's.  He was started on a lasix gtt (with a goal of
   [**1-27**] L negative) and has been on a heparin gtt given the balloon pump.
   He received a dose of 5 mg metolazone overnight and his lasix gtt was
   increased to 15 mg/hr.  His balloon pump was advanced slightly today.
   Fluconazole started per transplant surgery.  Patient had an abdominal
   US to evaluate for fluid collection which showed no large perihepatic
   fluid collection and a small right pleural effusion.  He woke up from
   sedation (although the sedation was unchanged) and tried to sit up
   during the day so his sedation was increased and he was placed in
   restraints given his groin lines.  His Hct check in the afternoon
   showed a 3 point Hct drop from 26.2 to 23.1.  We wanted to transfuse
   him a unit of PRBC, however he did not have a blood consent on the
   chart and his health care proxy could not be reached by phone.  On
   recheck it was 23.1, so it was decided that as he was stable to defer
   blood transfusion until consent could be received.
   This am the patient had a short episode of hypotension so his balloon
   was put to 1:1 (from 1:2) and his lasix gtt was stopped.

   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.
   Patient continues to be in shock which is likely multifactorial: both
   cardiac (hypotension, wedge in 30s in cath lab, but CI of 2.3) and
   septic (SVR in 700->800 range).   Now off levaphed, and on increased
   dose of dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some decrease in
   afterload and mild increase in DBP.  Cardiac contractility impaired
   likely due ot myocardial stunning as well as MI.  Pt. is also ~ 1.8L
   positive o/n, which is contributing to impaired forward flow, CVP is
   14, thus preload should be adequate.
   - Continue with balloon pump
   - Continue w/ dopamine with goal of MAP<65, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Will start lasix gtt given labile BPs w/ goal UOP of 100-150cc, >

   - Obtain SVR, CI/CO Q8hrs to reassess cardiac function and wean off
   IABP
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
   # ID.  Septic Shock.  Given fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC
   (now slightly improved) and ARDS type picture clinically and on XR
   (although can not technically designate as ARDS in setting of elevated
   PCWP), patient likely septic w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to
   pulmonary to urinary.  CXR most consistent w/ ARDS, this may be likely
   [**2-27**] aspiration given the rapid time course of events.  Tx for possible
   PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus
   also will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR
   and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT.  UA from this AM negative.   Line infection also a
   possibility, as R IJ placed on [**1-5**].
   -          Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn

   Chief Complaint:
   52M with history of Hep C and HCC s/p OLT here with biliary
   obstruction, now presenting with ? of cardiogenic vs septic shock s/p
   cath showing 3VD with 2 stents and an intraaortic balloon pump placed
   on dopamine.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's levophed was weaned off off two nights ago and his
   dopamine was increased.  He self-extubated himself yesterday am and was
   reintubated after he desated to the 80's.  He was started on a lasix
   gtt (with a goal of [**1-27**] L negative) and has been on a heparin gtt given
   the balloon pump.  He received a dose of 5 mg metolazone overnight and
   his lasix gtt was increased to 15 mg/hr with good response.  His
   balloon pump was advanced slightly yesterday now with better wave
   forms.  Fluconazole was started per transplant surgery.  Patient had an
   abdominal US to evaluate for fluid collection which showed no large
   perihepatic fluid collection and a small right pleural effusion.  He
   woke up from sedation (although the sedation was unchanged) and tried
   to sit up during the day so his sedation was increased and he was
   placed in restraints given his groin lines.  His Hct check in the
   afternoon showed a 3 point Hct drop from 26.2 to 23.1.  We wanted to
   transfuse him a unit of PRBC, however he did not have a blood consent
   on the chart and his health care proxy could not be reached by phone.
   On recheck it was 23.1, so it was decided that as he was stable to
   defer blood transfusion until consent could be received.
   This am the patient had a short episode of hypotension this am so his
   balloon was put to 1:1 (from 1:2) and his lasix gtt was stopped.  His
   dopamine gtt was increased to 10 mcg/kg/min and his BP
s stabilized.

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.
   Patient continues to be in shock which is likely multifactorial: both
   cardiac (hypotension, wedge in 30s in cath lab, but CI of 2.3) and
   septic (SVR in 700->800 range).   Now off levaphed, and on increased

   likely due ot myocardial stunning as well as MI.  Pt. is also ~ 1.8L
   positive o/n, which is contributing to impaired forward flow, CVP is
   14, thus preload should be adequate.
   - Continue with balloon pump
   - Continue w/ dopamine with goal of MAP<65, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Will start lasix gtt given labile BPs w/ goal UOP of 100-150cc, >
   -1L.
   - Obtain SVR, CI/CO Q8hrs to reassess cardiac function and wean off
   IABP
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
   # ID.  Septic Shock.  Given fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC
   (now slightly improved) and ARDS type picture clinically and on XR
   (although can not technically designate as ARDS in setting of elevated
   PCWP), patient likely septic w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to
   pulmonary to urinary.  CXR most consistent w/ ARDS, this may be likely
   [**2-27**] aspiration given the rapid time course of events.  Tx for possible

   and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT.  UA from this AM negative.   Line infection also a
   possibility, as R IJ placed on [**1-5**].
   -          Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn
   -          Sputum smear and Cx.
   -          Consider pulling R central line if fevers and septic picture

   -          Surveillance BCx, f/u current Cx.
   -          Obtain vanco trough tomorrow AM.
   .
   # CORONARIES: 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes
   peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   Current CK 1882.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 (from 26.2).  It remained
   stable at 23.1 overnight and increased to 23.7 this am.  Overnight the
   team wanted to transfuse him, however he did not have a blood consent
   on the chart and his health care proxy was not answering her phone.  As
   his Hct remained stable, it was decided to hold off on transfusions.
   He has many reasons for his Hct drop including his oozing right groin,
   the intraaortic balloon pump (causes some hemolysis), and frequent
   blood draws.
   -  Given his recent cardiac injury, will transfuse with a goal of Hct >
   30.
   -  This am will transfuse 2 units PRBC and recheck a post transfusion
   Hct.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  The patient
s Cr increased to 1.6 from 1.3 today.  His ARF is
   likely secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be
   partially related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow
   distally.
   -  Will manage his hypotension as above and try to remove the balloon
   pump today.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and consider further workup if his Cr doesn
   improve with resolution of his hypotension.

   The patient's levophed was weaned off off two nights ago and his
   dopamine was increased.  He self-extubated himself yesterday am and was
   reintubated after he desated to the 80's.  He was started on a lasix
   gtt (with a goal of [**1-27**] L negative) and has been on a heparin gtt given
   the balloon pump.  He received a dose of 5 mg metolazone overnight and
   his lasix gtt was increased to 15 mg/hr with good response.  His
   balloon pump was advanced slightly yesterday now with better wave
   forms.  Fluconazole was started per transplant surgery.  Patient had an
   abdominal US to evaluate for fluid collection which showed no large
   perihepatic fluid collection and a small right pleural effusion.  He
   woke up from sedation (although the sedation was unchanged) and tried
   to sit up during the day so his sedation was increased and he was
   placed in restraints given his groin lines.  His Hct check in the
   afternoon showed a 3 point Hct drop from 26.2 to 23.1.  We wanted to
   transfuse him a unit of PRBC, however he did not have a blood consent
   on the chart and his health care proxy could not be reached by phone.
   On recheck it was 23.1, so it was decided that as he was stable to
   defer blood transfusion until consent could be received.
   This am the patient had a short episode of hypotension this am so his
   balloon was put to 1:1 (from 1:2) and his lasix gtt was stopped.  His
   dopamine gtt was increased to 10 mcg/kg/min and his BP
s stabilized.

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.
   Patient continues to be in shock which is likely multifactorial: both
   cardiac (hypotension, wedge in 30s in cath lab, but CI of 2.3) and
   septic (SVR in 700->800 range).   Now off levaphed, and on increased
   dose of dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some decrease in
   afterload and mild increase in DBP.  Cardiac contractility impaired
   likely due ot myocardial stunning as well as MI.  Pt. is also ~ 1.8L
   positive o/n, which is contributing to impaired forward flow, CVP is
   14, thus preload should be adequate.
   - Continue with balloon pump
   - Continue w/ dopamine with goal of MAP<65, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Will start lasix gtt given labile BPs w/ goal UOP of 100-150cc, >
   -1L.
   - Obtain SVR, CI/CO Q8hrs to reassess cardiac function and wean off
   IABP
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
   # ID.  Septic Shock.  Given fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC
   (now slightly improved) and ARDS type picture clinically and on XR
   (although can not technically designate as ARDS in setting of elevated
   PCWP), patient likely septic w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to
   pulmonary to urinary.  CXR most consistent w/ ARDS, this may be likely
   [**2-27**] aspiration given the rapid time course of events.  Tx for possible
   PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus
   also will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR
   and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT.  UA from this AM negative.   Line infection also a
   possibility, as R IJ placed on [**1-5**].
   -          Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn
   -          Sputum smear and Cx.
   -          Consider pulling R central line if fevers and septic picture
   persists.
   -          Surveillance BCx, f/u current Cx.
   -          Obtain vanco trough tomorrow AM.
   .
   # CORONARIES: 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes
   peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   Current CK 1882.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 (from 26.2).  It remained
   stable at 23.1 overnight and increased to 23.7 this am.  Overnight the
   team wanted to transfuse him, however he did not have a blood consent
   on the chart and his health care proxy was not answering her phone.  As
   his Hct remained stable, it was decided to hold off on transfusions.
   He has many reasons for his Hct drop including his oozing right groin,
   the intraaortic balloon pump (causes some hemolysis), and frequent
   blood draws.
   -  Given his recent cardiac injury, will transfuse with a goal of Hct >
   30.
   -  This am will transfuse 2 units PRBC and recheck a post transfusion
   Hct.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  The patient
s Cr increased to 1.6 from 1.3 today.  His ARF is
   likely secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be
   partially related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow
   distally.
   -  Will manage his hypotension as above and try to remove the balloon
   pump today.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and consider further workup if his Cr doesn
   improve with resolution of his hypotension.
   # S/P OLT TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.
   - Continue cellcept and prograf.
   - F/u tacro level.
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.  Continue to monitor on tele.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Continued shock and hemodynamic instability due to cardiac injury and potential myocardial stunning.
	* Potential for cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.
	* Risk of further cardiac damage from the intraaortic balloon pump.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia and/or aspiration pneumonitis due to potential respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
	* Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
	* Potential for further respiratory distress and decreased oxygenation.
3. Infection complications:
	* Sepsis and septic shock due to possible intra-abdominal, pulmonary, or urinary infections.
	* Risk of line infections and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs).
	* Potential for opportunistic infections in an immunosuppressed patient.
4. Hematological complications:
	* Anemia and decreased hemoglobin levels due to ongoing bleeding and hemolysis from the intraaortic balloon pump.
	* Risk of further bleeding and hemodynamic instability.
5. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension, balloon pump, and potential nephrotoxic medications.
	* Risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
6. Biliary complications:
	* Bile leak and potential biliary peritonitis due to anastomotic stricture and ongoing bile drainage.
	* Risk of further biliary complications and potential sepsis.
7. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Bowel obstruction and potential perforation due to distended and tympanitic abdomen.
	* Risk of further gastrointestinal complications and potential sepsis.
8. Neurological complications:
	* Potential for increased intracranial pressure and cerebral edema due to ongoing hypotension and potential cardiac arrest.
	* Risk of further neurological damage and potential long-term sequelae.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management to prevent and address these complications promptly."

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   The
   patient continues on dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some
   decrease in afterload and mild increase in DBP.  As the patient
s CI
   continues to be normal, this is less likely cardiogenic shock and more
   likely septic shock (SVR is low in the 800
s).  Cardiac contractility
   impaired likely due to myocardial stunning from recent cardiac injury.
   - Will work to wean the balloon pump off and remove it today.
   - Continue dopamine gtt with goal of MAP >60, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection as well as fluconazole
   given his immunocompromised status.
   - Will obtain a TTE to evaluate for interval change of his cardiac
   function.
   # ID.  Possible septic Shock.  The patient was afebrile yesterday, but
   given previous fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC (now slightly
   improved), the patient is likely septic w/ sources ranging from
   intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  CXR this am looked improved
   after diuresis for a net negative 1 L yesterday.  Tx for possible PNA,
   although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus also
   will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR and
   fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.   Culture data has been
   NGTD.  Line infection also a possibility.
   - Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn and coverage for
   fungi with fluconazole.
   - Sputum smear and Cx.
   - After the patient is weaned off the balloon pump and the heparin gtt
   is stopped, will pull his swan and arterial lines as these are possible
   sources of infection.  Will leave the RIJ for now, but can consider
   placing a new central line t/m and pulling that if he remains
   hypotensive.
   - Surveillance BCx, f/u current Cx.
   - F/u pending vanc level
   # CORONARIES: The patient was found to have 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS
   placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI
   5.7.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   - Will obtain another TTE to evaluate for interval change in his
   cardiac function.
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 (from 26.2).  It remained
   stable at 23.1 overnight and increased to 23.7 this am.  Overnight the
   team wanted to transfuse him, however he did not have a blood consent
   on the chart and his health care proxy was not answering her phone.  As
   his Hct remained stable, it was decided to hold off on transfusions.
   He has many reasons for his Hct drop including his oozing right groin,
   the intraaortic balloon pump (causes some hemolysis), and frequent
   blood draws.
   -  Given his recent cardiac injury, will transfuse with a goal of Hct >
   30.
   -  This am will transfuse 2 units PRBC and recheck a post transfusion
   Hct.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse
   airway opacities.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   - Will restart the lasix gtt with a goal of keeping him even today as
   his CXR looks slightly drier.  Will increase the gtt when giving the 2
   units of PRBC as below.
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  The patient
s Cr increased to 1.6 from 1.3 today.  His ARF is
   likely secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be
   partially related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow
   distally.
   -  Will manage his hypotension as above and try to remove the balloon
   pump today.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and consider further workup if his Cr doesn
   improve with resolution of his hypotension.
   # S/P OLT TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.
   - Continue cellcept and prograf.
   - F/u tacro level.
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.  Continue to monitor on tele.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   52M with history of Hep C and HCC s/p OLT here with biliary
   obstruction, now presenting with ? of cardiogenic vs septic shock s/p
   cath showing 3VD with 2 stents and an intraaortic balloon pump placed
   on dopamine.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient's levophed was weaned off off two nights ago and his
   dopamine was increased.  He self-extubated himself yesterday am and was
   reintubated after he desated to the 80's.  He was started on a lasix
   gtt (with a goal of [**1-27**] L negative) and has been on a heparin gtt given
   the balloon pump.  He received a dose of 5 mg metolazone overnight and
   his lasix gtt was increased to 15 mg/hr with good response.  His
   balloon pump was advanced slightly yesterday now with better wave
   forms.  Fluconazole was started per transplant surgery.  Patient had an
   abdominal US to evaluate for fluid collection which showed no large
   perihepatic fluid collection and a small right pleural effusion.  He
   woke up from sedation (although the sedation was unchanged) and tried
   to sit up during the day so his sedation was increased and he was
   placed in restraints given his groin lines.  His Hct check in the
   afternoon showed a 3 point Hct drop from 26.2 to 23.1.  We wanted to
   transfuse him a unit of PRBC, however he did not have a blood consent
   on the chart and his health care proxy could not be reached by phone.
   On recheck it was 23.1, so it was decided that as he was stable to
   defer blood transfusion until consent could be received.
   This am the patient had a short episode of hypotension this am so his
   balloon was put to 1:1 (from 1:2) and his lasix gtt was stopped.  His
   dopamine gtt was increased to 10 mcg/kg/min and his BP
s stabilized.

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # SHOCK.  Echo showed severely depressed EF and severe anterior
   hypo/akinesis with cardiac cath revealing 3VD with LAD and RCA stenting
   performed.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI 5.7.   The
   patient continues on dopamine.  Currently on balloon pump with some
   decrease in afterload and mild increase in DBP.  As the patient
s CI
   continues to be normal, this is less likely cardiogenic shock and more
   likely septic shock (SVR is low in the 800
s).  Cardiac contractility
   impaired likely due to myocardial stunning from recent cardiac injury.
   - Will work to wean the balloon pump off and remove it today.
   - Continue dopamine gtt with goal of MAP >60, wean as tolerated by BPs
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue with sepsis work-up as below, and continued Vanco/Zosyn for
   possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection as well as fluconazole
   given his immunocompromised status.
   - Will obtain a TTE to evaluate for interval change of his cardiac
   function.
   # ID.  Possible septic Shock.  The patient was afebrile yesterday, but
   given previous fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC (now slightly
   improved), the patient is likely septic w/ sources ranging from
   intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  CXR this am looked improved
   after diuresis for a net negative 1 L yesterday.  Tx for possible PNA,
   although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus also
   will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR and
   fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.   Culture data has been
   NGTD.  Line infection also a possibility.
   - Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn and coverage for
   fungi with fluconazole.
   - Sputum smear and Cx.
   - After the patient is weaned off the balloon pump and the heparin gtt
   is stopped, will pull his swan and arterial lines as these are possible
   sources of infection.  Will leave the RIJ for now, but can consider
   placing a new central line t/m and pulling that if he remains
   hypotensive.
   - Surveillance BCx, f/u current Cx.
   - F/u pending vanc level
   # CORONARIES: The patient was found to have 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS
   placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI
   5.7.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   - Will obtain another TTE to evaluate for interval change in his
   cardiac function.
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 (from 26.2).  It remained
   stable at 23.1 overnight and increased to 23.7 this am.  Overnight the
   team wanted to transfuse him, however he did not have a blood consent
   on the chart and his health care proxy was not answering her phone.  As
   his Hct remained stable, it was decided to hold off on transfusions.
   He has many reasons for his Hct drop including his oozing right groin,
   the intraaortic balloon pump (causes some hemolysis), and frequent
   blood draws.
   -  Given his recent cardiac injury, will transfuse with a goal of Hct >
   30.
   -  This am will transfuse 2 units PRBC and recheck a post transfusion
   Hct.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse
   airway opacities.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   - Will restart the lasix gtt with a goal of keeping him even today as
   his CXR looks slightly drier.  Will increase the gtt when giving the 2
   units of PRBC as below.
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  The patient
s Cr increased to 1.6 from 1.3 today.  His ARF is
   likely secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be
   partially related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow
   distally.
   -  Will manage his hypotension as above and try to remove the balloon
   pump today.
   -  Continue to trend Cr and consider further workup if his Cr doesn
   improve with resolution of his hypotension.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) who underwent an Orthotopic Liver Transplant (OLT) and is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to cardiogenic and septic shock. The patient has a biliary obstruction and is receiving treatment for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection. The patient's cardiac function is impaired due to myocardial stunning from recent cardiac injury, and he is receiving dopamine and an intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) to support his blood pressure. The patient's respiratory status is also compromised, with a need for mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. The patient's anemia is likely due to multiple factors, including the IABP, frequent blood draws, and oozing from the right groin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac function is impaired, and he is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and cardiogenic shock.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his immunocompromised status, recent surgical intervention, and presence of central lines and other invasive devices.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and he is at risk for further respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory acidosis.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to multiple factors, and he is at risk for further anemia and related complications, such as hypovolemic shock.
5. Biliary obstruction: The patient's biliary obstruction is likely due to an anastomotic stricture, and he is at risk for further complications, such as cholangitis and biliary cirrhosis.
6. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is at risk for further renal failure, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
7. Infections: The patient is at risk for various infections, including pneumonia, intra-abdominal infection, and line infections, due to his immunocompromised status and presence of invasive devices.
8. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to his anemia, platelet dysfunction, and presence of invasive devices, including the IABP and central lines.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust treatment as needed to prevent further cardiac complications.
2. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and other supportive measures.
3. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory status with mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust treatment as needed to prevent further anemia and related complications.
5. Continue to treat the patient's biliary obstruction with antibiotics and other supportive measures.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as needed to prevent further renal failure.
7. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of infection and adjust treatment as needed to prevent further infections.
8. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of bleeding and adjust treatment as needed to prevent further bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # SHOCK.  More likely to be septic shock as echo shows improved
   function, EF 50%.   Dopamine changed to levophed and pt has minimal
   pressor requirements.  IABP removed yesterday successfully.
   - continue Levophed as necessary
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection
   as well as fluconazole given his immunosuppression
   # ID.  Possible septic Shock.  The patient has been afebrile X 2 days,
   but given previous fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC (now
   slightly improved), the patient is likely septic w/ sources ranging
   from intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  Tx for possible PNA,
   although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus also
   will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR and
   fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.   Culture data has been
   NGTD.  Lines removed yesterday.  New a-line placed.
   - Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn and coverage for
   fungi with fluconazole.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - check vanc levels q3 doses.
   # CORONARIES: The patient was found to have 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS
   placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI
   5.7.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 and patient received 2 units of
   PRBCs.  PM HCT returned at 33.  No clear source of bleeding.
   -  Given his recent cardiac injury, will transfuse with a goal of Hct >
   30.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse
   airway opacities.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  Improved to 1.4 today, down from 1.6.  His ARF is likely
   secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be partially
   related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow distally.
   -  Continue to trend.
   # S/P OLT TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.  Tacro held yesterday
   for level of 15.0.
   - Continue cellcept and prograf.
   - F/u daily tacro level.
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.  Continue to monitor on tele.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # SHOCK.  More likely to be septic shock as echo shows improved
   function, EF 50%.   Dopamine changed to levophed and pt has minimal
   pressor requirements.  IABP removed yesterday successfully.
   - continue Levophed as necessary
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection
   as well as fluconazole given his immunosuppression
   # ID.  Possible septic Shock.  The patient has been afebrile X 2 days,
   but given previous fevers, hypotension, low SVR, elevated WBC (now
   slightly improved), the patient is likely septic w/ sources ranging
   from intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  Tx for possible PNA,
   although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also immunosuppressed thus also
   will consider opportunistic infections if no improvement in SVR and
   fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and tympanitic, no fluid
   collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.   Culture data has been
   NGTD.  Lines removed yesterday.  New a-line placed.
   - Continue empiric treatment for HCAP w/ vanco/zosyn and coverage for
   fungi with fluconazole.
   - continue to follow cultures
   - check vanc levels q3 doses.
   # CORONARIES: The patient was found to have 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS
   placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI
   5.7.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 and patient received 2 units of
   PRBCs.  PM HCT returned at 33.  No clear source of bleeding.
   -  Given his recent cardiac injury, will transfuse with a goal of Hct >
   30.
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse
   airway opacities.
   - Continue with mechanical ventilation, wean O2 sat
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  Improved to 1.4 today, down from 1.6.  His ARF is likely
   secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be partially
   related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow distally.
   -  Continue to trend.
   # S/P OLT TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.  Tacro held yesterday
   for level of 15.0.
   - Continue cellcept and prograf.
   - F/u daily tacro level.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of HCC, HEP C, and OLT, who presented with shock and was found to have possible MI and likely sepsis. He has been diagnosed with septic shock, and his treatment plan includes continuing levophed as necessary, holding antihypertensives, and administering vancomycin and zosyn for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection. He also has a history of biliary obstruction, and his LFTs are trending downward. He is being treated for possible PNA, and his abdomen is distended and tympanitic. He has a new a-line placed, and his lines were removed yesterday.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock may worsen if not properly managed, leading to organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and death.
2. Intra-abdominal Infection: The patient's intra-abdominal infection may spread to other areas of the body, causing sepsis and organ failure.
3. Pneumonitis: The patient's possible PNA may worsen if not properly treated, leading to respiratory failure and death.
4. ARF: The patient's ARF may worsen if not properly managed, leading to kidney failure and death.
5. Biliary Obstruction: The patient's biliary obstruction may worsen if not properly managed, leading to liver failure and death.
6. Opportunistic Infections: The patient's immunosuppression may increase his risk of developing opportunistic infections, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of possible MI and cardiac catheterization may increase his risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to respiratory arrest and death.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to assess his response to treatment.
2. Continue to administer levophed as necessary to manage the patient's blood pressure.
3. Continue to administer vancomycin and zosyn for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's abdomen for signs of infection or perforation.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust his treatment plan as necessary.
8. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's regimen to cover for possible opportunistic infections.
9. Consider adding antifungal medication to the patient's regimen to cover for possible fungal infections.
10. Consider adding antiviral medication to the patient's regimen to cover for possible viral infections."

   Echo [**2107-1-11**]:   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
   size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
   There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   severe hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall and moderate hypokinesis
   of the distal septum. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
   50 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Turning off the IABP, there was near akinesis of the distal inferior
   wall and more severe hypokinesis of the distal septum.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-1-8**], left
   ventricular systolic function is improved (may be related to IABP)..
   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Likely etiology of continued hypotension and prior fevers.
   Echo shows improved EF of 50% and this is less likely to be
   cardiogenic.   IABP removed yesterday successfully.  The patient has
   been afebrile X 2 days, but given previous fevers, hypotension, low
   SVR, elevated WBC (now slightly improved), the patient is likely septic
   w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  Tx
   for possible PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also
   immunosuppressed thus also will consider opportunistic infections if no
   improvement in SVR and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and
   tympanitic, no fluid collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.
   Culture data has been NGTD.  Lines removed yesterday.  New a-line
   placed.
   - continue Levophed as necessary with goal to wean today
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection
   as well as fluconazole given his immunosuppression
   Vanc day #4 of 10 (ends [**1-18**])
   Zosyn day #4 of 10 (ends [**1-18**])
   Fluconazole day #3 of 10 (ends [**1-19**])
   - will attempt to wean pressors to pull R IJ today to reduce other
   potential sources
   # CORONARIES: The patient was found to have 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS
   placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI
   5.7.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 and patient received 2 units of

   -  continue to trend HCT
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse

   29.  Per surgery, no plans to return to the OR immediately.
   - will attempt extubation today, wean sedation
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   TTE done on and off pump shows improved systolic function but continues
   to have distal inferior wall hypokinesis and distal septal
   hypokinesis.  Received 2 units PRBCs yesterday and HCT improved from 23
   to 33.  Tacro was d/c'd due to high morning level and AM level checked
   today.  Balloon pump d/c'd at 5pm and pt changed from dopamine to
   levophed.  Femoral lines removed and R radial a-line placed.

   Echo [**2107-1-11**]:   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity
   size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal.
   There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   severe hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall and moderate hypokinesis
   of the distal septum. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF =
   50 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Turning off the IABP, there was near akinesis of the distal inferior
   wall and more severe hypokinesis of the distal septum.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2107-1-8**], left
   ventricular systolic function is improved (may be related to IABP)..
   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Likely etiology of continued hypotension and prior fevers.
   Echo shows improved EF of 50% and this is less likely to be
   cardiogenic.   IABP removed yesterday successfully.  The patient has
   been afebrile X 2 days, but given previous fevers, hypotension, low
   SVR, elevated WBC (now slightly improved), the patient is likely septic
   w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  Tx
   for possible PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also
   immunosuppressed thus also will consider opportunistic infections if no
   improvement in SVR and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and
   tympanitic, no fluid collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.
   Culture data has been NGTD.  Lines removed yesterday.  New a-line
   placed.
   - continue Levophed as necessary with goal to wean today
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection
   as well as fluconazole given his immunosuppression
   Vanc day #4 of 10 (ends [**1-18**])
   Zosyn day #4 of 10 (ends [**1-18**])
   Fluconazole day #3 of 10 (ends [**1-19**])
   - will attempt to wean pressors to pull R IJ today to reduce other
   potential sources
   # CORONARIES: The patient was found to have 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS
   placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI
   5.7.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 and patient received 2 units of
   PRBCs.  PM HCT returned at 33.  No clear source of bleeding.
   -  continue to trend HCT
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse
   airway opacities. Vent settings weaned to [**5-31**] 40% FiO2 with RSBIs of
   29.  Per surgery, no plans to return to the OR immediately.
   - will attempt extubation today, wean sedation
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  Improved to 1.4 today, down from 1.6.  His ARF is likely
   secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be partially
   related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow distally.
   -  Continue to trend.
   # S/P OLT TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.  Tacro held yesterday
   for level of 15.0.
   - Continue cellcept, holding Tacrolimus
   - F/u daily tacro level.
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.  Continue to monitor on tele.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, liver transplant, and biliary obstruction, presenting with shock, possible myocardial infarction, and likely sepsis. He has undergone several interventions, including ERCP and Roux-en-Y hepatic jejunostomy, and has been treated with antibiotics, antifungals, and vasopressors.

Recent events include:

* Echocardiogram shows improved left ventricular systolic function, but with distal inferior wall hypokinesis and distal septal hypokinesis.
* IABP was removed yesterday, and the patient's blood pressure has been stable.
* The patient has been afebrile for 2 days, but has a history of fevers and hypotension, suggesting ongoing sepsis.
* The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and has a hematocrit of 33.
* The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he has been treated with antibiotics and antifungals.

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis: The patient is likely septic with sources ranging from intra-abdominal to pulmonary to urinary.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and the IABP was removed yesterday.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is on ventilator support and has a risk of pulmonary edema, ARDS, multifocal PNA, and aspiration pneumonitis.
* Anemia: The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and has a hematocrit of 33.
* Biliary obstruction: The patient has a history of biliary obstruction and anastomotic stricture, which may be a source of infection.
* Acute renal failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, which is likely secondary to his episodes of hypotension and may be partially related to the balloon pump.
* Opportunistic infections: The patient is immunosuppressed and has a risk of opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.

Plan:

* Continue Levophed as necessary to maintain blood pressure.
* Hold antihypertensives.
* Continue antibiotics and antifungals for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection.
* Attempt to wean pressors to pull R IJ today to reduce other potential sources.
* Continue to trend hematocrit.
* Attempt extubation today and wean sedation.
* Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now.
* Trend daily LFTs and follow up with transplant surgery recommendations.
* Continue with cellcept, holding Tacrolimus.
* Follow up with transplant team daily.
* Continue to monitor rhythm and adjust therapy as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Extubated successfully in AM.  Off levophed at noon, BPs maintained
   well until 6pm, when SBP < 80.  I/Os were even, but NPO.   Gave 250cc
   NS bolus as CVP 6 at the time, BP responded to 110s.  Cx data negative
   to date, Vanco level 21, but Vanc dosing 1g [**Hospital1 **].  A-line removed as was
   cracked.   Per Transplant, holding Tacrolimus, will PTC tomorrow, NP
   past MN.  Transplant wanted to keep IJ for at least one more day.
   Patient was agitated early in am, was oriented x1, received zydis 5mg
   x1 w/ good effect.  On exam has myoclonic jerks, asterexis, and was
   later A&Ox0, w/ loss of immediate recall.  Started lactulose 30mg Q4h
   PO prn for 3-4BMs, NPO for PTC, so only received 2 doses, nonetheless,
   stooled Q1-2hrs, guiac positive.  Received an additional IVF bolus 250
   for SBP maintenance w/ BMs.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), Hepatitis C, and Orthotopic Liver Transplant (OLT). He presented with shock, likely due to sepsis and possible myocardial infarction (MI). He was intubated and extubated successfully. His blood pressure (BP) was well-maintained until 6 pm, when it dropped to <80 mmHg. He received a 250cc normal saline (NS) bolus, which responded by increasing his BP to 110s. His central venous pressure (CVP) was 6 mmHg at the time. He was given Vancomycin (Vanco) and Zosyn for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) and intra-abdominal infection. He also received Fluconazole for immunosuppression.

The patient's physical examination revealed myoclonic jerks, asterixis, and altered mental status (AMS). He was later found to have a guaiac-positive stool, indicating bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. His laboratory results showed elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fevers suggest sepsis, which may be caused by a bacterial or fungal infection.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac catheterization showed 3-vessel disease, and he received balloon angioplasty and stenting. However, his enzymes peaked at 2260, which may indicate ongoing cardiac damage.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level increased from 1.2 to 1.4 mg/dL, indicating AKI.
4. Biliary obstruction: The patient's biliary obstruction may be causing ongoing infection and sepsis.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac-positive stool suggests bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, which may be related to his biliary obstruction or other causes.
6. Hypotension: The patient's BP dropped to <80 mmHg, which may be related to sepsis, cardiogenic shock, or other causes.
7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, which may be related to bleeding or other causes.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, including potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus, may be abnormal, which may be related to his liver disease or other causes.
9. Infection: The patient's infection may be caused by bacteria, fungi, or other pathogens, which may be related to his biliary obstruction, surgical site, or other causes.
10. Organ failure: The patient's liver and kidney function may be compromised, which may be related to his underlying liver disease or other causes.

Based on this information, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to identify any potential complications and adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with HCC, HEP C, OLT, now w/ biliary obstruction, s/p ERCP and
   rouxenY hepatic jejunostomy, presenting with shock, s/p possible MI and
   likely sepsis.
   # Sepsis: Likely etiology of continued hypotension and prior fevers.
   Echo shows improved EF of 50% and this is less likely to be
   cardiogenic.   IABP removed yesterday successfully.  The patient has
   been afebrile X 2 days, but given previous fevers, hypotension, low
   SVR, elevated WBC (now slightly improved), the patient is likely septic
   w/ sources ranging from intraabdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.  Tx
   for possible PNA, although pneumonitis also possible.  Pt also
   immunosuppressed thus also will consider opportunistic infections if no
   improvement in SVR and fevers by tomorrow.  Abdomen is distended and
   tympanitic, no fluid collection on CT or on US.  UA was negative.
   Culture data has been NGTD.  Lines removed yesterday.  New a-line
   placed.
   - continue Levophed as necessary with goal to wean today
   - Holding antihypertensives
   - Continue Vanco/Zosyn for possible HCAP and intra-abdominal infection
   as well as fluconazole given his immunosuppression
   Vanc day #4 of 10 (ends [**1-18**])
   Zosyn day #4 of 10 (ends [**1-18**])
   Fluconazole day #3 of 10 (ends [**1-19**])
   - will attempt to wean pressors to pull R IJ today to reduce other
   potential sources
   # CORONARIES: The patient was found to have 3VD on cardiac cath.  BMS
   placed to LAD and RCA.  Enzymes peaked at 2260, w/ CKMB at 108 and MBI
   5.7.
   - Continue Aspirin/plavix
   - Holding beta-blocker and ACEI given shock
   # ANEMIA. HCT dropped yesterday to 23.1 and patient received 2 units of
   PRBCs.  PM HCT returned at 33.  No clear source of bleeding.
   -  continue to trend HCT
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Differential includes pulmonary edema vs  ARDS
   vs multifocal PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.  CXR shows stable diffuse
   airway opacities. Vent settings weaned to [**5-31**] 40% FiO2 with RSBIs of
   29.  Per surgery, no plans to return to the OR immediately.
   - will attempt extubation today, wean sedation
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole for now
   # BILIARY OBSTRUCTION, HCC and Hep C.  Biliary obstruction [**2-27**]
   anastomotic stricture.  Overall LFTs are slightly trending downward.
   Given recent surgical intervention, could be source of infection.
   - Trend daily LFTs
   - F/U transplant surgery recs.
   - Continue with vanc/zosyn/fluconazole given bile leak in his abdomen
   as a source of infection.
   # ARF.  Improved to 1.4 today, down from 1.6.  His ARF is likely
   secondary to his episodes of hypotension and also may be partially
   related to the balloon pump as it does not augment blood flow distally.
   -  Continue to trend.
   # S/P OLT TRANSPLANT.  Transplant team following.  Tacro held yesterday
   for level of 15.0.
   - Continue cellcept, holding Tacrolimus
   - F/u daily tacro level.
   # RHYTHM:  NSR in 80
 90s.  Continue to monitor on tele.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   24 Hour Events:
   Extubated successfully in AM.  Off levophed at noon, BPs maintained
   well until 6pm, when SBP < 80.  I/Os were even, but NPO.   Gave 250cc
   NS bolus as CVP 6 at the time, BP responded to 110s.  Cx data negative
   to date, Vanco level 21, but Vanc dosing 1g [**Hospital1 **].  A-line removed as was
   cracked.   Per Transplant, holding Tacrolimus, will PTC tomorrow, NP
   past MN.  Transplant wanted to keep IJ for at least one more day.
   Patient was agitated early in am, was oriented x1, received zydis 5mg
   x1 w/ good effect.  On exam has myoclonic jerks, asterexis, and was
   later A&Ox0, w/ loss of immediate recall.  Started lactulose 30mg Q4h
   PO prn for 3-4BMs, NPO for PTC, so only received 2 doses, nonetheless,
   stooled Q1-2hrs, guiac positive.  Received an additional IVF bolus 250

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), Hepatitis C, and Orthotopic Liver Transplant (OLT). He is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to shock, possible myocardial infarction (MI), and likely sepsis. His condition has been complicated by biliary obstruction, intra-abdominal infection, and immunosuppression.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 127/78 mmHg. He is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a central venous catheter (CVC) in place.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 14.2 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.9 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 158 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.4 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* Calcium: 7.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 1.7 mg/dL

The patient is receiving various medications, including:

* Levophed for blood pressure support
* Vancomycin and Zosyn for possible intra-abdominal infection
* Fluconazole for immunosuppression
* Aspirin and Plavix for coronary artery disease
* Cellcept for immunosuppression
* Fentanyl for pain management

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is likely septic, with sources ranging from intra-abdominal, to pulmonary to urinary.
2. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty and stenting.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and he has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.
5. Biliary obstruction: The patient has a history of biliary obstruction and is at risk for further complications.
6. Hepatitis C: The patient has a history of Hepatitis C and is at risk for further complications.
7. Opportunistic infections: The patient is immunosuppressed and is at risk for opportunistic infections.
8. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of cardiac arrhythmias and is at risk for further complications.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The plan is to continue Levophed for blood pressure support, holding antihypertensives, and continuing Vancomycin and Zosyn for possible intra-abdominal infection. The patient will also receive Fluconazole for immunosuppression and Aspirin and Plavix for coronary artery disease. The plan is to wean the patient off pressors and attempt extubation today."
