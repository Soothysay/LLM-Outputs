You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 34-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with dyspnea. The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy, biopsies were taken, and a stent was placed to prevent obstruction while awaiting definitive radiation treatment. The patient is expected to be transferred to Hospital Unit 4 on February 20th.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 125 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 105/64 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 95%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 30.7 (25.9 - 25.0 - 21.6)
* Hct: 26.7 (29.8 - 30.1 - 27.3)
* Plt: 11 (telephone/fax not provided)
* Cr: 0.5 (0.5 - 0.5 - 0.5)
* TropT: 0.18
* Glucose: 09 (telephone/fax not provided)
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.8/30.2/1.2, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 139/9/0.18, ALT/AST: 28/44, Alk Phos/T Bili: 581/1.9, Differential-Neuts: 75.0%, Band: 3.0%, Lymph: 16.0%, Mono: 2.0%, Eos: 0.0%, Fibrinogen: 243 mg/dL, LDH: 3820 IU/L, Ca++: 7.6 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 2.8 mg/dL

Imaging studies show:

* CXR: A left upper lung mass extending to the hilum, with a curvilinear lucency to the left of the stent, which may represent small pneumomediastinum.
* ECHO: Moderate depression of left ventricular systolic function, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%. There is also mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's dyspnea and respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute may indicate respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's moderate depression of left ventricular systolic function and mild resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction may increase the risk of cardiac complications.
3. Infection: The patient's pending blood culture, urine culture, and MRSA screen may indicate the presence of an infection.
4. Electrolyte and fluid disorders: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate of 125 beats per minute may indicate tachycardia, which may be a sign of underlying cardiac disease or infection.

The patient's care plan should include:

1. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Administration of antibiotics pending culture results.
3. Management of electrolyte and fluid disorders.
4. Monitoring for signs of respiratory failure and cardiac complications.
5. Consideration of invasive procedures, such as central venous catheterization or pulmonary artery catheterization, to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status."

   s/p tracheal stent placement in hte upper thoracic trachea. left upper
   lung
   mass unchanged, extending to hilum. of note, there is a curvilinear
   lucency
   to the left of the stent, which may represent small pneumomediastinum,
   though
   no ohter evidence of mediastinal air is seen.
   ECHO [**2133-2-19**]
   The left atrium is normal in size. No atrial septal defect or patent
   foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
   maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
   ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is moderately depressed (LVEF= 35 %) secondary to extensive
   anteroapical akinesis. The basal segments of the left ventricle are
   hyperdynamic. There is a mild resting left ventricular outflow tract
   obstruction. Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with focal
   hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The ascending aorta is mildly
   dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is
   no mitral valve prolapse. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CTA [**2133-2-19**]:
   1. No acute aortic pathology or pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary
   hypertension.
   2. Large pleural based mass extending into the left upper lobe, found
   to
   likely represent non-small carcinoma per outside hospital ([**Hospital1 12340**]) biopsy report. A smaller left posterior apical opacity is
   concerning
   for a second mass lesion.
   3. Multifocal RUL ground-glass opacities, non-specific but could
   represent
   infection, inflammation, or neoplastic process.
   4. Enlarged, thyroid containing large thyroid nodules extending into
   the
   anterior mediastinum, substernally. If these findings have not
   previously
   been further evaluated, further work-up is suggested.
   5. 2.3 cm ill-defined hypodense segment VII hepatic lesion. 2.4 cm

   Assessment/Summary
   44yo gentleman with h/o recently discovered pulmonary malignancy
   presenting with dyspnea x 2 days. Large lung mass encasing PA. Troponin
   leak and somewhat diffuse ST elevation, but clean coronaries on cath.
   Neagtive CTA in ED and negative pulmonary angiogram in cath lab. Wedge
   20 mmHg, mildly elevated. Echo with regional wall motion
   abnormality.Lung cancer and spine met due for radiotherapy yesterday.
   When stable will need emergent radiotherapy. Leading hypothesis is
   acute onset is both reduced lung volume and acute onset mild pulmonary
   hypertension.
   Plan
   # Pulmonary Mass
   Ddx includes adenocarcinoma vs primary thyroid malignancy. It is
   incasing pulmonary artery. Slightly and likely acutely increased wedge
   with likely sudden onset mild pulmonary hypertension. Thus likely
   worsened lung volumes and perfusion. PA HTN most likely [**12-23**] elevated
   wedge and from mass effect. Pt s/p tracheal stent in anticipation of
   radiation.
   - Pt to start radiation therapy to reduce tumor burden that are likely
   the explanation behind these cardiopulmonary sequelae
   - Oncology recs, appreciate input
   - F/u path report of biopsy
   - Chemo to start once diagnosis is confirmed.
   - Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] today
   # Anemia, normocytic, acute on chronic
   Baseline Hct unknown (but pt states he has recent h/o anemia),
   admission Hct 28. Post transfusion recheck of 26. Presence of
   tachycardia suggests hemodynamic instability. He denies black or bloody
   stools, groin pain/hematoma. There is no clear source of bleeding.
   Would consider the possibility of marrow suppression or hemolysis.
   However, t-bili normal. Is s/p 2 units. Caution retroperitoneal bleed.
   - trend hemolysis labs
   - will monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Keep HCT between 26 and 30.
   - Obtain formal smear
   - Obtain retic
   # Shortness of breath and Hypoxia
   Most likely [**12-23**] V/Q mismatch caused by direct and indirect inflammatory
   effects of the large mass on the lung. PE, CHF, MI ruled out. Consider
   obesity/hypoventilation as a contributor.
   - Attempt to wean down O2
   - Consider emperic antibiotics for post-obstructive PNA if spikes or
   decompensates
   # Cardiomyopathy: EF of 35%. Focality suggests ischemic in nature,
   however, clean coronaries. Consider autolysed thrombus. Possibly
   secondary to large mass causing increasing PA and wedge pressures and
   wall motion defects.
   - Monitor
   # Leukocytosis with 3% bands
   Per above question of post obstructive PNA. [**Month (only) 8**] also represent primary
   lymphoma, leukemia. Less likely and dx of exclusion would be stress
   response to primary malignancy.
   - Tissue for lung mass
   - Consider empiric antibiotics for post-obstructive PNA if becomes
   hemodynamically unstable per above
   - f./u  urine, blood, and sputum Cx
   - Monitor WBC count
   # Hyponatremia
   Improved with hypertonic saline Therefore likely SIADH. Euvolemic, most
   consistent with SIADH and probable mixed picture with some hypovolemia.
   Went from 121 to 119. Pt developed some confusion later overnight,
   concerning for cerebral edema.
   - Fluid restrict to 1.2L
   - Get OSH/PCP records to see if longer standing
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Monitor sodium

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment/Summary
   44yo gentleman with h/o recently discovered pulmonary malignancy
   presenting with dyspnea x 2 days. Large lung mass encasing PA. Troponin
   leak and somewhat diffuse ST elevation, but clean coronaries on cath.
   Neagtive CTA in ED and negative pulmonary angiogram in cath lab. Wedge
   20 mmHg, mildly elevated. Echo with regional wall motion
   abnormality.Lung cancer and spine met due for radiotherapy yesterday.
   When stable will need emergent radiotherapy. Leading hypothesis is
   acute onset is both reduced lung volume and acute onset mild pulmonary
   hypertension.
   Plan
   # Pulmonary Mass
   Ddx includes adenocarcinoma vs primary thyroid malignancy. It is
   incasing pulmonary artery. Slightly and likely acutely increased wedge
   with likely sudden onset mild pulmonary hypertension. Thus likely
   worsened lung volumes and perfusion. PA HTN most likely [**12-23**] elevated
   wedge and from mass effect. Pt s/p tracheal stent in anticipation of
   radiation.
   - Pt to start radiation therapy to reduce tumor burden that are likely

   # Shortness of breath and Hypoxia
   Most likely [**12-23**] V/Q mismatch caused by direct and indirect inflammatory
   effects of the large mass on the lung. PE, CHF, MI ruled out. Consider
   obesity/hypoventilation as a contributor.
   - Attempt to wean down O2
   - Consider emperic antibiotics for post-obstructive PNA if spikes or
   decompensates
   # Cardiomyopathy: EF of 35%. Focality suggests ischemic in nature,
   however, clean coronaries. Consider autolysed thrombus. Possibly
   secondary to large mass causing increasing PA and wedge pressures and
   wall motion defects.
   - Monitor

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy and a large lung mass encasing the pulmonary artery. The patient is experiencing dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's lung mass and pulmonary hypertension can lead to decreased lung function, which can worsen respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiomyopathy with an EF of 35% and regional wall motion abnormalities can lead to cardiac failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's tachycardia, hypotension, and hyponatremia can lead to hemodynamic instability, which can worsen respiratory and cardiac failure.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated white count can indicate an infection, which can worsen respiratory and cardiac failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's hyponatremia and SIADH can lead to cerebral edema and neurological complications.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of anemia and recent transfusions can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which can worsen respiratory and cardiac failure.
7. Renal complications: The patient's hyponatremia and SIADH can lead to renal failure, which can worsen respiratory and cardiac failure.

The patient is scheduled to start radiation therapy to reduce tumor burden, which can help alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. The patient will also require close monitoring for respiratory, cardiac, and hemodynamic complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment/Summary
   44yo gentleman with h/o recently discovered pulmonary malignancy
   presenting with dyspnea x 2 days. Large lung mass encasing PA. Troponin
   leak and somewhat diffuse ST elevation, but clean coronaries on cath.
   Neagtive CTA in ED and negative pulmonary angiogram in cath lab. Wedge
   20 mmHg, mildly elevated. Echo with regional wall motion
   abnormality.Lung cancer and spine met due for radiotherapy yesterday.
   When stable will need emergent radiotherapy. Leading hypothesis is
   acute onset is both reduced lung volume and acute onset mild pulmonary
   hypertension.
   Plan
   # Pulmonary Mass
   Ddx includes adenocarcinoma vs primary thyroid malignancy. It is
   incasing pulmonary artery. Slightly and likely acutely increased wedge
   with likely sudden onset mild pulmonary hypertension. Thus likely
   worsened lung volumes and perfusion. PA HTN most likely [**12-23**] elevated
   wedge and from mass effect. Pt s/p tracheal stent in anticipation of
   radiation.
   - Pt to start radiation therapy to reduce tumor burden that are likely

   # Shortness of breath and Hypoxia
   Most likely [**12-23**] V/Q mismatch caused by direct and indirect inflammatory
   effects of the large mass on the lung. PE, CHF, MI ruled out. Consider
   obesity/hypoventilation as a contributor.
   - Attempt to wean down O2
   - Consider emperic antibiotics for post-obstructive PNA if spikes or
   decompensates
   # Cardiomyopathy: EF of 35%. Focality suggests ischemic in nature,
   however, clean coronaries. Consider autolysed thrombus. Possibly
   secondary to large mass causing increasing PA and wedge pressures and
   wall motion defects.
   - Monitor

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of lung cancer and a large pulmonary mass encasing the pulmonary artery. He presents with dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia. The patient has undergone rigid bronchoscopy, biopsies, and stent placement to prevent obstruction. He has been transferred to the ICU for further management.

Potential medical complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's large pulmonary mass and possible pulmonary hypertension may lead to ARDS, which can cause hypoxia and respiratory failure.
2. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's echocardiogram shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%, which may be secondary to the large mass causing increased pulmonary artery and wedge pressures, and wall motion defects.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be due to post-obstructive pneumonia, primary lymphoma, or leukemia.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, which may be due to SIADH, hypovolemia, or a mixed picture.
5. Elevated cardiac biomarkers: The patient's troponin level is elevated, which may be due to demand ischemia, regional myocarditis, or dissolved clot.
6. Sinus tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be due to hypovolemia, hypoxia, or infection.
7. Bone pain: The patient has chronic back pain, which may be due to the lung cancer or other underlying conditions.
8. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be due to chronic disease, blood loss, or bone marrow suppression.
9. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's CTA shows no acute aortic pathology or pulmonary embolism, but the patient's elevated white blood cell count and possible pulmonary hypertension may increase the risk of pulmonary embolism.
10. Radiation therapy complications: The patient is scheduled to undergo radiation therapy, which may cause complications such as radiation pneumonitis, esophagitis, or bone marrow suppression.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's primary diagnosis is lung cancer with a large pulmonary mass encasing the pulmonary artery. The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia are likely due to the mass effect on the lung and possible pulmonary hypertension. The patient's anemia, leukocytosis, and hyponatremia are secondary to the underlying disease process.

The plan is to start radiation therapy to reduce the tumor burden and alleviate symptoms. The patient will be transferred to a different hospital unit for further management. The patient will be monitored for signs of ARDS, cardiomyopathy, and leukocytosis. The patient's electrolytes and cardiac biomarkers will be closely monitored, and the patient will receive prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy."

   Assessment/Summary
   44yo gentleman with h/o recently discovered pulmonary malignancy
   presenting with dyspnea x 2 days. Large lung mass encasing PA. Troponin
   leak and somewhat diffuse ST elevation, but clean coronaries on cath.
   Neagtive CTA in ED and negative pulmonary angiogram in cath lab. Wedge
   20 mmHg, mildly elevated. Echo with regional wall motion
   abnormality.Lung cancer and spine met due for radiotherapy yesterday.
   When stable will need emergent radiotherapy. Leading hypothesis is
   acute onset is both reduced lung volume and acute onset mild pulmonary
   hypertension.
   Plan
   # Pulmonary Mass
   Ddx includes adenocarcinoma vs primary thyroid malignancy. It is
   incasing pulmonary artery. Slightly and likely acutely increased wedge
   with likely sudden onset mild pulmonary hypertension. Thus likely
   worsened lung volumes and perfusion. PA HTN most likely [**12-23**] elevated
   wedge and from mass effect. Pt s/p tracheal stent in anticipation of
   radiation.
   - Pt to start radiation therapy to reduce tumor burden that are likely
   the explanation behind these cardiopulmonary sequelae
   - Oncology recs, appreciate input
   - F/u path report of biopsy
   - Chemo to start once diagnosis is confirmed.
   - Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] today
   # Anemia, normocytic, acute on chronic
   Baseline Hct unknown (but pt states he has recent h/o anemia),
   admission Hct 28. Post transfusion recheck of 26. Presence of
   tachycardia suggests hemodynamic instability. He denies black or bloody
   stools, groin pain/hematoma. There is no clear source of bleeding.
   Would consider the possibility of marrow suppression or hemolysis.
   However, t-bili normal. Is s/p 2 units. Caution retroperitoneal bleed.
   - trend hemolysis labs
   - will monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Keep HCT between 26 and 30.
   - Obtain formal smear
   - Obtain retic
   # Shortness of breath and Hypoxia
   Most likely [**12-23**] V/Q mismatch caused by direct and indirect inflammatory
   effects of the large mass on the lung. PE, CHF, MI ruled out. Consider
   obesity/hypoventilation as a contributor.
   - Attempt to wean down O2
   - Consider emperic antibiotics for post-obstructive PNA if spikes or
   decompensates
   # Cardiomyopathy: EF of 35%. Focality suggests ischemic in nature,
   however, clean coronaries. Consider autolysed thrombus. Possibly
   secondary to large mass causing increasing PA and wedge pressures and
   wall motion defects.
   - Monitor
   # Leukocytosis with 3% bands
   Per above question of post obstructive PNA. [**Month (only) 8**] also represent primary
   lymphoma, leukemia. Less likely and dx of exclusion would be stress
   response to primary malignancy.
   - Tissue for lung mass
   - Consider empiric antibiotics for post-obstructive PNA if becomes
   hemodynamically unstable per above
   - f./u  urine, blood, and sputum Cx
   - Monitor WBC count
   # Hyponatremia
   Improved with hypertonic saline Therefore likely SIADH. Euvolemic, most
   consistent with SIADH and probable mixed picture with some hypovolemia.
   Went from 121 to 119. Pt developed some confusion later overnight,
   concerning for cerebral edema.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications and potential issues are noted:

1. Pulmonary Mass: The patient has a large lung mass encasing the pulmonary artery, which is causing pulmonary hypertension and reduced lung volumes. This is likely to worsen the patient's cardiopulmonary function.
2. Anemia: The patient has normocytic anemia, which is acute on chronic. The cause of this anemia is unclear, but it may be related to marrow suppression or hemolysis.
3. Shortness of Breath and Hypoxia: The patient's shortness of breath and hypoxia are likely caused by a V/Q mismatch due to the large lung mass. PE, CHF, and MI have been ruled out.
4. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a moderately depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35%, which may be secondary to the large lung mass causing increased PA and wedge pressures and wall motion defects.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with 3% bands, which may be related to a post-obstructive pneumonia or a primary lymphoma, leukemia, or stress response to the primary malignancy.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which has improved with hypertonic saline and is likely due to SIADH. There may be some hypovolemia as well.
7. Elevated Cardiac Biomarkers and ST Elevation: The patient has elevated cardiac biomarkers and ST elevation, which may be due to demand ischemia or regional myocarditis.
8. Sinus Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia, which may be due to hypovolemia, hypoxia, or infection.
9. Back Pain/Bone Pain: The patient has chronic back pain and bone pain, which may be related to the primary malignancy or other underlying conditions.
10. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has a fluid and electrolyte imbalance, with low sodium levels and hyponatremia. There may be some hypovolemia as well.

The plan for the patient includes:

1. Transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for further treatment and management.
2. Radiation therapy to reduce the tumor burden and alleviate symptoms.
3. Chemotherapy to start once the diagnosis is confirmed.
4. Monitoring of hemodynamic stability and cardiac function.
5. Management of anemia and leukocytosis.
6. Fluid and electrolyte management to correct hyponatremia and hypovolemia.
7. Pain management for back pain and bone pain.
8. Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 12347**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12348**] is a 44 yo male with a newly diagnosed lung mass
   admitted with SOB likely secondary to compression of airway by lung
   mass.
   .
   1.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to large lung mass with compression
   of bronchus.  CTA negative for PE.  Echo showed apical akinesis with EF
   of 35% but cardiac cath was negative for CAD.  Patient is s/p rigid
   bronch with biopsy and stent placement.  No current evidence of
   pneumonia.  ?small pneumomediastinum noted on CXR also noted following
   stent placement and biopsy now no longer on CXR.   His respiratory
   status decompensated and had hypoxia/hypercapnia, with altered mental
   status.
   - intubation will be done
   - after intubation will need to go to XRT for pulm mass treatment and
   other studies
   .
   2.  Lung mass.  S/p biopsy by rigid bronch. Prior pathology suggestive
   of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, but not conclusive.  Lung mass is likely the
   source of patient's SOB and therefor would benefit from XRT.
   - onc following
   - continue XRT
   - tracheal stent placed, will be rm
d after XRT done
   - f/u on pathology both in house and OSH.
   .
   3. altered mental status: agitation and combativeness was noted,
   thought to be a combination of medication induced, metabolic
   abnormality, possible a component of baseline personality/coping
   mechanism.
   - r/o bleed or tumor involvment by MRI of head
   - sedation on ventilator for treatment
   .
   4.  Hyponatremia.  Patient had altered mental status and hyponatrmia.
   Renal feels this is consistent with siadh +/- hypovelemia.
   - Fluid restrict (pt [**Name (NI) 2938**]
   - Obtain records for baseline Na
   - f/u renal recs
   - question if free water restrcition < 1000 mL/day is necessary
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to dehydration.  Also possibilty
   secondary to pain (though appears comfortable at present).  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to large lung mass and also possibly secondary to the
   pneumomediastinum.
   - monitor on tele, ivf boluses
   - pain control
   - could be [**12-23**] infection, follow Bcx
   .
   6.  Leukocytosis.  No clear evidence of infection, but at risk for
   post-obstructive PNA.  WBC trending down without antibiotics. Likely
   secondary to prednisone use prior to admission for ?back pain.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   7.  Takotsubo.  EKG with ST elevations, but cardiac cath negative.
   Echo also showed extensive anteroapical akinesis with EF of 35%.  This
   is likely secondary to tkotsubo cardiomyotathy.
   - follow up as opt for echo
   .
   8.  Anemia.  Baseline Hct unknown and no clear source of bleeding.
   Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
   - trend Hct
   - obtain baseline Hct
   - anemia studies
   .
   9. Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to respiratory distress +/-
   dehydration.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   10.  Back pain.  Back pain is secondary to pathological L4 fracture and
   invasion of T11, T12 and L5 with metastatic disease.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old male admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) due to a large lung mass compressing the bronchus. He underwent rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and stent placement. The patient's respiratory status decompensated, and he required intubation. He is currently receiving radiation therapy for the lung mass. The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Tachycardia: likely secondary to dehydration, pain, or the large lung mass.
2. Hyponatremia: possibly secondary to SIADH or hypovolemia.
3. Leukocytosis: likely secondary to prednisone use or post-obstructive pneumonia.
4. Anemia: likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
5. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: likely secondary to stress.
6. Thrombocytopenia: acute.
7. Back pain: secondary to pathological L4 fracture and metastatic disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: due to the large lung mass compressing the bronchus.
2. Pneumonia: due to post-obstructive pneumonia or aspiration.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: due to takotsubo cardiomyopathy or electrolyte imbalance.
4. Bleeding: due to thrombocytopenia or anemia.
5. Infection: due to the lung mass or other sources.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: due to hyponatremia or other factors.
7. Metastatic disease: due to the lung mass and potential spread to other areas of the body.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory status, electrolyte imbalance, and other medical complications. He will require ongoing radiation therapy for the lung mass, and further studies will be needed to determine the pathology of the tumor. The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia will need to be managed with blood transfusions and other supportive measures. The patient's back pain will require ongoing pain management."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 12347**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12348**] is a 44 yo male with a newly diagnosed lung mass
   admitted with SOB likely secondary to compression of airway by lung
   mass.
   .
   1.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to large lung mass with compression
   of bronchus.  CTA negative for PE.  Echo showed apical akinesis with EF
   of 35% but cardiac cath was negative for CAD.  Patient is s/p rigid
   bronch with biopsy and stent placement.  No current evidence of
   pneumonia.  ?small pneumomediastinum noted on CXR also noted following
   stent placement and biopsy, now resolved.
   - monitor respiratory status
   - XRT notified of his arrival here
   - if respiratory status decompensates, will need to intubate.
   .
   2.  Lung mass.  S/p biopsy by rigid bronch. Prior pathology suggestive
   of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, but not conclusive.  Lung mass is likely the
   source of patient's SOB and therefor would benefit from XRT.
   - onc following
   - XRT today
   - tracheal stent placed, will be rm
d after XRT done
   - f/u on pathology
   .
   2.  Hyponatremia.  Patient had altered mental status and hyponatrmia.
   Renal feels this is consistent with siadh +/- hypovelemia.
   - Fluid restrict (pt [**Name (NI) 2938**]
   - Obtain records for baseline Na
   - renal recs
   - free water restrcition < 1000 mL/day
   - repeat urine sodium and osms
   - high protein diet to increase urea
   .
   3.  Tachycardia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to dehydration.  Also possibilty
   secondary to pain (though appears comfortable at present).  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to large lung mass and also possibly secondary to the
   pneumomediastinum.
   - monitor on tele
   - ivf boluses
   - pain control
   .
   3.  Leukocytosis.  No clear evidence of infection, but at risk for
   post-obstructive PNA.  WBC trending down without antibiotics. Likely
   secondary to prednisone use prior to admission for ?back pain.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   4.  Takotsubo.  EKG with ST elevations, but cardiac cath negative.
   Echo also showed extensive anteroapical akinesis with EF of 35%.  This
   is likely secondary to tkotsubo cardiomyotathy.
   .
   5.  Anemia.  Baseline Hct unknown and no clear source of bleeding.
   Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
   - trend Hct
   - obtain baseline Hct
   - anemia studies
   .
   6. Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to respiratory distress +/-
   dehydration.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   7.  Back pain.  Back pain is secondary to pathological L4 fracture and
   invasion of T11, T12 and L5 with metastatic disease.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a newly diagnosed lung mass, admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) likely secondary to compression of the airway by the lung mass. The patient has undergone rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and stent placement, and the pathology is suggestive of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), adenocarcinoma, but not conclusive.

The patient is currently experiencing:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient has altered mental status and hyponatremia, which is consistent with SIADH +/- hypovolemia. Fluid restriction is recommended, and the patient is to receive a high-protein diet to increase urea.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely secondary to dehydration, pain, or the large lung mass, and is being monitored on telemetry.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, but no clear evidence of infection. The WBC is trending down without antibiotics, and the patient is at risk for post-obstructive pneumonia.
4. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: The patient's EKG shows ST elevations, and the echo shows extensive anteroapical akinesis with an EF of 35%. This is likely secondary to takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but the baseline Hct is unknown, and there is no clear source of bleeding. The anemia is likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
6. Sinus tachycardia: The patient's sinus tachycardia is likely secondary to respiratory distress +/- dehydration.

The patient is at risk for:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's SOB is likely to worsen, and he may require intubation if his respiratory status decompensates.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for post-obstructive pneumonia, and cultures should be obtained to monitor for infection.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's takotsubo cardiomyopathy may lead to cardiac complications, and close monitoring is recommended.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for DVT and PE, and prophylactic measures such as boots and SQ UF heparin are recommended.
5. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hyponatremia and tachycardia are likely to worsen if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and be prepared to intubate if necessary.
2. Obtain cultures to monitor for infection.
3. Continue to manage the patient's tachycardia with IVF boluses and pain control.
4. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusions if necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's fluid and electrolyte imbalance with fluid restriction and high-protein diet.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and consider further cardiac workup if necessary.
7. Consider a psychiatric consult to evaluate the patient's delirium and potential underlying conditions.
8. Continue to manage the patient's pain with Dilaudid and Tylenol.
9. Monitor the patient's bowel function and consider a bowel regimen if necessary.
10. Consider a thyroid disorder workup to evaluate the patient's possible thyroid dysfunction."

   Mr. [**Known firstname 12347**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12348**] is a 44 yo male with a newly diagnosed lung mass
   admitted with SOB likely secondary to compression of airway by lung
   mass.
   .
   1.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to large lung mass with compression
   of bronchus.  CTA negative for PE.  Echo showed apical akinesis with EF
   of 35% but cardiac cath was negative for CAD.  Patient is s/p rigid
   bronch with biopsy and stent placement.  No current evidence of
   pneumonia.  ?small pneumomediastinum noted on CXR also noted following
   stent placement and biopsy now no longer on CXR.   His respiratory
   status decompensated and had hypoxia/hypercapnia, with altered mental
   status.  Intubated on [**2-22**] for AMS and the need for radiation, MRI.
   there was some trauma and febrile temps on [**2-22**] as well as mild bump in
   WBC
   - D1 of vanc/cefepime in [**2-22**], continue as long as intubate
   - aim to remove sedation, using propofol bridge
   - radiation to resume on monday
   .
   # Hypotension - patient became hypotension with sedation and
   ventilation. Requires Levophed
   - wean sedation
   - treat possible infection
   - pressor support as needed
   .
   2.  Lung mass.  S/p biopsy by rigid bronch. Prior pathology suggestive
   of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, but not conclusive.  Lung mass is likely the
   source of patient's SOB and therefor would benefit from XRT.
   - onc following
   - continue XRT
   - tracheal stent placed, will be rm
d after XRT done
   - f/u on pathology both in house and OSH.
   .
   3. altered mental status: agitation and combativeness was noted,
   thought to be a combination of medication induced, metabolic
   abnormality, possible a component coping mechanism.
   - r/o bleed or tumor involvment by MRI of head
   - sedation on ventilator for treatment
   .
   4.  Hyponatremia.  Patient had altered mental status and hyponatrmia.
   Renal feels this is consistent with siadh +/- hypovelemia. It resolved
   with fluid replacement
   - trend Na
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to dehydration.  Also possibilty
   secondary to pain (though appears comfortable at present).  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to large lung mass and also possibly secondary to the
   pneumomediastinum.
   - monitor on tele, ivf boluses
   - pain control
   - could be [**12-23**] infection, follow Bcx
   .
   6.  Leukocytosis.  No clear evidence of infection, but at risk for
   post-obstructive PNA.  WBC trending down without antibiotics. Likely
   secondary to prednisone use prior to admission for ?back pain.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   7.  Takotsubo.  EKG with ST elevations, but cardiac cath negative.
   Echo also showed extensive anteroapical akinesis with EF of 35%.  This
   is likely secondary to tkotsubo cardiomyotathy.
   - follow up as opt for echo
   .
   8.  Anemia.  Baseline Hct unknown and no clear source of bleeding.
   Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease.
   - trend Hct
   .
   9. Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to respiratory distress +/-
   dehydration.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   10.  Back pain.  Back pain is secondary to pathological L4 fracture and
   invasion of T11, T12 and L5 with metastatic disease.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a newly diagnosed lung mass, admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) likely secondary to compression of the airway by the lung mass. The patient's respiratory status has decompensated, and he has been intubated for altered mental status (AMS) and the need for radiation and MRI.

The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential medical complications. The following are some of the key issues:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Thyroid disorder: The patient has an abnormal thyroid function test, which may be related to his underlying cancer or other medical conditions.
4. Cancer: The patient has a newly diagnosed lung mass, which is likely a malignant neoplasm.
5. Pulmonary nodules: The patient has multiple pulmonary nodules, which may be related to his lung cancer.
6. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has hyponatremia and may have other electrolyte imbalances, which may be related to his underlying medical conditions or medications.
7. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be related to dehydration, pain, or other medical conditions.
8. Altered mental status: The patient has AMS, which may be related to his underlying medical conditions, medications, or other factors.
9. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may be related to infection, inflammation, or other medical conditions.
10. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: The patient has cardiac symptoms, including ST elevations on his electrocardiogram, which may be related to this condition.
11. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, which may be related to anemia of chronic disease or other medical conditions.
12. Back pain: The patient has back pain, which may be related to his underlying cancer or other medical conditions.

Based on this information, the patient's ICU care plan should include:

1. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and hemodynamic parameters.
2. Management of his electrolyte and fluid imbalances.
3. Treatment of his underlying medical conditions, including his lung cancer and other potential complications.
4. Management of his pain and discomfort.
5. Monitoring of his mental status and adjusting his sedation regimen as needed.
6. Management of his cardiovascular symptoms, including his tachycardia and potential takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
7. Monitoring of his hematological parameters, including his platelet count and hemoglobin level.
8. Management of his back pain and other symptoms related to his underlying medical conditions.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 12347**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12348**] is a 44 yo male with a newly diagnosed lung mass
   admitted with SOB likely secondary to compression of airway by lung
   mass.
   .
   #.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to large lung mass with compression
   of bronchus.  CTA negative for PE.  Echo showed apical akinesis with EF
   of 35% but cardiac cath was negative for CAD.  Patient is s/p rigid
   bronch with biopsy and stent placement.  No current evidence of
   pneumonia.  ?small pneumomediastinum noted on CXR also noted following
   stent placement and biopsy now no longer on CXR.   His respiratory
   status decompensated and had hypoxia/hypercapnia, with altered mental
   status.  Intubated on [**2-22**] for AMS and the need for radiation, MRI.
   there was some trauma and febrile temps on [**2-22**] as well as mild bump in
   WBC
   - D2 of vanc/cefepime on [**2-22**] for presumed pneumonia, continue as long
   as intubate. Positive GPC in sputum, f/up sputum cx, contact
   precautions
   - continue current vent settings, attempt to place A-line for ABG
   assessment
   - aim to remove sedation, using propofol bridge
   - radiation to resume on monday
   .
   # Hypotension - patient became hypotension with sedation and
   ventilation. Requires Levophed
   - wean sedation
   - treat possible infection
   - pressor support as needed
   - f/up hemodynamic status after receiving 3 units PRBC, adjust pressor
   support accordingly given possible preload-dependence
   .
   #.  Lung mass.  S/p biopsy by rigid bronch. Prior pathology suggestive
   of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, but not conclusive.  Lung mass is likely the
   source of patient's SOB and therefor would benefit from XRT.
   - onc following
   - continue XRT
   - tracheal stent placed, will be rm
d after XRT done
   - f/u on pathology both in house and OSH.
   .
   #. altered mental status: agitation and combativeness was noted,
   thought to be a combination of medication induced, metabolic
   abnormality, possible a component coping mechanism.
   - r/o bleed or tumor involvment by MRI of head
   - sedation on ventilator for treatment
   .
   #.  Hyponatremia.  Patient had altered mental status and hyponatrmia.
   Renal feels this is consistent with SIADH +/- hypovolemia. It has
   resolved with fluid replacement
   - trend Na
   - UA, Ulytes
   .
   #.  Tachycardia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to dehydration.  Also possibilty
   secondary to pain (though appears comfortable at present).  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to large lung mass and also possibly secondary to the
   pneumomediastinum.
   - monitor on tele, ivf boluses
   - pain control
   - could be [**12-23**] infection, follow Bcx
   .
   #.  Leukocytosis.  No clear evidence of infection, but at risk for
   post-obstructive PNA.  WBC trending down without antibiotics. Likely
   secondary to prednisone use prior to admission for ?back pain.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #.  Takotsubo.  EKG with ST elevations, but cardiac cath negative.
   Echo also showed extensive anteroapical akinesis with EF of 35%.  This
   is likely secondary to tkotsubo cardiomyotathy.
   - repeat echo today
   .
   #.  Anemia/thrombocytopenia.  Baseline Hct/plt unknown and no clear
   source of bleeding. Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease vs.
   hemolysis. Plt decrease could be secondary to DIC
   - trend Hct, plt
   - transfuse 3 units PRBC today, goal hct > 26, plt >30
   - f/up smears, DIC labs for possible microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
   - f/up Hem/Onc recs
   .
   #. Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to respiratory distress +/-
   dehydration.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   #.  Back pain.  Back pain is secondary to pathological L4 fracture and
   invasion of T11, T12 and L5 with metastatic disease.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a newly diagnosed lung mass, likely causing compression of the airway and leading to respiratory distress. The patient's respiratory status has decompensated, and he was intubated on [**2-22**] for altered mental status and the need for radiation and MRI.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.9°F (102.6°F peak)
* Heart rate: 128 bpm
* Blood pressure: 89/56 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 96%
* PEEP: 10 cmH2O
* FiO2: 40%

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 89/56 mmHg, and he is requiring pressor support with Levophed.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is 128 bpm, which may be secondary to dehydration, pain, or the large lung mass.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is 15.9 K/uL, which may be secondary to prednisone use prior to admission or post-obstructive pneumonia.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 6.1 g/dL, and platelet count is 108, which may be secondary to anemia of chronic disease or hemolysis.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is 112 mEq/L, which may be secondary to SIADH or hypovolemia.
6. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: The patient's EKG shows ST elevations, and his echo shows extensive anteroapical akinesis with an EF of 35%.
7. Pneumomediastinum: The patient has a small pneumomediastinum noted on CXR, which may be secondary to stent placement and biopsy.
8. Lung mass: The patient has a large lung mass, likely causing compression of the airway and leading to respiratory distress.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics for presumed pneumonia
* Attempting to place an arterial line for ABG assessment
* Weaning sedation and using propofol bridge
* Resuming radiation therapy on Monday
* Treating possible infection with antibiotics
* Providing pressor support as needed
* Trending hemodynamic status and adjusting pressor support accordingly
* Following up on pathology results and considering further diagnostic testing
* Managing the patient's pain with Dilaudid and Tylenol
* Monitoring for signs of bleeding or tumor involvement
* Trending sodium levels and considering further diagnostic testing for hyponatremia
* Following up on platelet count and considering further diagnostic testing for thrombocytopenia
* Considering further diagnostic testing for anemia and hemolysis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 12347**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12348**] is a 44 yo male with a newly diagnosed lung mass
   admitted with SOB likely secondary to compression of airway by lung
   mass.
   .
   1.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to large lung mass with compression
   of bronchus.  CTA negative for PE.  Echo showed apical akinesis with EF
   of 35% but cardiac cath was negative for CAD.  Patient is s/p rigid
   bronch with biopsy and stent placement.  No current evidence of
   pneumonia.  ?small pneumomediastinum noted on CXR also noted following
   stent placement and biopsy now no longer on CXR.   His respiratory
   status decompensated and had hypoxia/hypercapnia, with altered mental
   status.  Intubated on [**2-22**] for AMS and the need for radiation, MRI.
   there was some trauma and febrile temps on [**2-22**] as well as mild bump in
   WBC
   - D1 of vanc/cefepime on [**2-22**] for presumed pneumonia, continue as long
   as intubate. Positive GPC in sputum, f/up sputum cx, contact
   precautions
   - continue current vent settings, attempt to place A-line for ABG
   assessment
   - aim to remove sedation, using propofol bridge
   - radiation to resume on monday
   .
   # Hypotension - patient became hypotension with sedation and
   ventilation. Requires Levophed
   - wean sedation
   - treat possible infection
   - pressor support as needed
   - f/up hemodynamic status after receiving 3 units PRBC, adjust pressor
   support accordingly given possible preload-dependence
   .
   2.  Lung mass.  S/p biopsy by rigid bronch. Prior pathology suggestive
   of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, but not conclusive.  Lung mass is likely the
   source of patient's SOB and therefor would benefit from XRT.
   - onc following
   - continue XRT
   - tracheal stent placed, will be rm
d after XRT done
   - f/u on pathology both in house and OSH.
   .
   3. altered mental status: agitation and combativeness was noted,
   thought to be a combination of medication induced, metabolic
   abnormality, possible a component coping mechanism.
   - r/o bleed or tumor involvment by MRI of head
   - sedation on ventilator for treatment
   .
   4.  Hyponatremia.  Patient had altered mental status and hyponatrmia.
   Renal feels this is consistent with SIADH +/- hypovolemia. It has
   resolved with fluid replacement
   - trend Na
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to dehydration.  Also possibilty
   secondary to pain (though appears comfortable at present).  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to large lung mass and also possibly secondary to the
   pneumomediastinum.
   - monitor on tele, ivf boluses
   - pain control
   - could be [**12-23**] infection, follow Bcx
   .
   6.  Leukocytosis.  No clear evidence of infection, but at risk for
   post-obstructive PNA.  WBC trending down without antibiotics. Likely
   secondary to prednisone use prior to admission for ?back pain.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   7.  Takotsubo.  EKG with ST elevations, but cardiac cath negative.
   Echo also showed extensive anteroapical akinesis with EF of 35%.  This
   is likely secondary to tkotsubo cardiomyotathy.
   - repeat echo today
   .
   8.  Anemia/thrombocytopenia.  Baseline Hct/plt unknown and no clear
   source of bleeding. Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease vs.
   hemolysis. Plt decrease could be secondary to DIC
   - trend Hct, plt
   - transfuse 3 units PRBC today, goal hct > 26, plt >30
   - f/up smears, DIC labs for possible microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
   - f/up Hem/Onc recs
   .
   9. Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to respiratory distress +/-
   dehydration.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   10.  Back pain.  Back pain is secondary to pathological L4 fracture and
   invasion of T11, T12 and L5 with metastatic disease.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old male with a newly diagnosed lung mass, admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) likely secondary to compression of the airway by the lung mass. The patient underwent rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and stent placement, and was intubated due to altered mental status and hypoxia/hypercapnia. The patient has a history of fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, and is at risk for post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but the patient remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but the patient remains at risk for respiratory failure due to the large lung mass and potential for post-obstructive pneumonia.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of fever and leukocytosis, and is at risk for infection, particularly post-obstructive pneumonia.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of tachycardia and ST elevations on EKG, and may be at risk for cardiac complications, including takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of anemia and thrombocytopenia, and may be at risk for bleeding complications.
5. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension, and may be at risk for further hypotension due to dehydration, sepsis, or other underlying conditions.
6. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia, particularly post-obstructive pneumonia, due to the large lung mass and potential for bacterial colonization.
7. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis due to the presence of a lung mass and potential for bacterial colonization.
8. Cardiac tamponade: The patient has a history of pneumomediastinum, and may be at risk for cardiac tamponade due to the presence of a lung mass and potential for bleeding.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but the patient remains at risk for respiratory failure due to the large lung mass and potential for post-obstructive pneumonia.
10. Infection: The patient has a history of fever and leukocytosis, and is at risk for infection, particularly post-obstructive pneumonia.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue current ventilator settings and attempt to place an arterial line for ABG assessment.
2. Wean sedation and treat possible infection.
3. Provide pressor support as needed and f/u hemodynamic status after receiving 3 units PRBC.
4. Continue XRT and follow up on pathology results.
5. Monitor for signs of infection, including fever, leukocytosis, and changes in respiratory status.
6. F/u on cardiac status, including EKG and echo.
7. Trend Hct and plt, and transfuse as necessary.
8. F/u on hematology and oncology recommendations.
9. Monitor for signs of bleeding, including decreased platelet count and increased bleeding time.
10. F/u on respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 12347**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12348**] is a 44 yo male with a newly diagnosed lung mass
   admitted with SOB likely secondary to compression of airway by lung
   mass.
   .
   1.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to large lung mass with compression
   of bronchus.  CTA negative for PE.  Echo showed apical akinesis with EF
   of 35% but cardiac cath was negative for CAD.  Patient is s/p rigid
   bronch with biopsy and stent placement.  No current evidence of
   pneumonia.  ?small pneumomediastinum noted on CXR also noted following
   stent placement and biopsy now no longer on CXR.   His respiratory
   status decompensated and had hypoxia/hypercapnia, with altered mental
   status.  Intubated on [**2-22**] for AMS and the need for radiation, MRI.
   there was some trauma and febrile temps on [**2-22**] as well as mild bump in
   WBC
   - D1 of vanc/cefepime in [**2-22**], continue as long as intubate
   - aim to remove sedation, using propofol bridge
   - radiation to resume on monday
   .
   # Hypotension - patient became hypotension with sedation and
   ventilation. Requires Levophed
   - wean sedation
   - treat possible infection
   - pressor support as needed
   .
   2.  Lung mass.  S/p biopsy by rigid bronch. Prior pathology suggestive
   of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, but not conclusive.  Lung mass is likely the
   source of patient's SOB and therefor would benefit from XRT.
   - onc following
   - continue XRT
   - tracheal stent placed, will be rm
d after XRT done
   - f/u on pathology both in house and OSH.
   .
   3. altered mental status: agitation and combativeness was noted,
   thought to be a combination of medication induced, metabolic
   abnormality, possible a component coping mechanism.
   - r/o bleed or tumor involvment by MRI of head
   - sedation on ventilator for treatment
   .
   4.  Hyponatremia.  Patient had altered mental status and hyponatrmia.
   Renal feels this is consistent with siadh +/- hypovelemia. It resolved
   with fluid replacement
   - trend Na
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to dehydration.  Also possibilty
   secondary to pain (though appears comfortable at present).  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to large lung mass and also possibly secondary to the
   pneumomediastinum.
   - monitor on tele, ivf boluses
   - pain control
   - could be [**12-23**] infection, follow Bcx
   .
   6.  Leukocytosis.  No clear evidence of infection, but at risk for
   post-obstructive PNA.  WBC trending down without antibiotics. Likely
   secondary to prednisone use prior to admission for ?back pain.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   7.  Takotsubo.  EKG with ST elevations, but cardiac cath negative.
   Echo also showed extensive anteroapical akinesis with EF of 35%.  This
   is likely secondary to tkotsubo cardiomyotathy.
   - follow up as opt for echo
   .
   8.  Anemia/thrombocytopenia.  Baseline Hct/plt unknown and no clear
   source of bleeding. Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease. Plt
   decrease could be
   - trend Hct, plt
   - transfuse as needed, goal hct > 26, plt >30
   .
   9. Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to respiratory distress +/-
   dehydration.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   10.  Back pain.  Back pain is secondary to pathological L4 fracture and
   invasion of T11, T12 and L5 with metastatic disease.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 12347**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12348**] is a 44 yo male with a newly diagnosed lung mass
   admitted with SOB likely secondary to compression of airway by lung
   mass.
   .
   1.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to large lung mass with compression
   of bronchus.  CTA negative for PE.  Echo showed apical akinesis with EF
   of 35% but cardiac cath was negative for CAD.  Patient is s/p rigid
   bronch with biopsy and stent placement.  No current evidence of
   pneumonia.  ?small pneumomediastinum noted on CXR also noted following
   stent placement and biopsy now no longer on CXR.   His respiratory
   status decompensated and had hypoxia/hypercapnia, with altered mental
   status.  Intubated on [**2-22**] for AMS and the need for radiation, MRI.
   there was some trauma and febrile temps on [**2-22**] as well as mild bump in
   WBC
   - D1 of vanc/cefepime in [**2-22**], continue as long as intubate
   - aim to remove sedation, using propofol bridge
   - radiation to resume on monday
   .
   # Hypotension - patient became hypotension with sedation and
   ventilation. Requires Levophed
   - wean sedation
   - treat possible infection
   - pressor support as needed
   .
   2.  Lung mass.  S/p biopsy by rigid bronch. Prior pathology suggestive
   of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, but not conclusive.  Lung mass is likely the
   source of patient's SOB and therefor would benefit from XRT.
   - onc following
   - continue XRT
   - tracheal stent placed, will be rm
d after XRT done
   - f/u on pathology both in house and OSH.
   .
   3. altered mental status: agitation and combativeness was noted,
   thought to be a combination of medication induced, metabolic
   abnormality, possible a component coping mechanism.
   - r/o bleed or tumor involvment by MRI of head
   - sedation on ventilator for treatment
   .
   4.  Hyponatremia.  Patient had altered mental status and hyponatrmia.
   Renal feels this is consistent with siadh +/- hypovelemia. It resolved
   with fluid replacement
   - trend Na
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to dehydration.  Also possibilty
   secondary to pain (though appears comfortable at present).  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to large lung mass and also possibly secondary to the
   pneumomediastinum.
   - monitor on tele, ivf boluses
   - pain control
   - could be [**12-23**] infection, follow Bcx
   .
   6.  Leukocytosis.  No clear evidence of infection, but at risk for
   post-obstructive PNA.  WBC trending down without antibiotics. Likely
   secondary to prednisone use prior to admission for ?back pain.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   7.  Takotsubo.  EKG with ST elevations, but cardiac cath negative.
   Echo also showed extensive anteroapical akinesis with EF of 35%.  This
   is likely secondary to tkotsubo cardiomyotathy.
   - follow up as opt for echo
   .
   8.  Anemia/thrombocytopenia.  Baseline Hct/plt unknown and no clear
   source of bleeding. Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease. Plt
   decrease could be
   - trend Hct, plt
   - transfuse as needed, goal hct > 26, plt >30
   .
   9. Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to respiratory distress +/-
   dehydration.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   10.  Back pain.  Back pain is secondary to pathological L4 fracture and
   invasion of T11, T12 and L5 with metastatic disease.

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's current health status and potential medical complications:

**Current Health Status:**

* The patient is a 44-year-old male with a newly diagnosed lung mass, admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) likely secondary to compression of the airway by the lung mass.
* He has undergone rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and stent placement, and is currently intubated for altered mental status (AMS) and respiratory distress.
* He has developed hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status, which are being managed with sedation, pressor support, and fluid replacement.
* He has a history of back pain, which is likely secondary to a pathological L4 fracture and metastatic disease.
* He has undergone chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and is scheduled for further treatment.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Infection:** The patient has developed fever, increasing pulmonary secretions, and a positive Gram-positive cocci (GPC) culture, which may indicate a developing infectious process.
2. **Pneumonia:** Given the patient's history of respiratory distress and altered mental status, he is at risk for developing post-obstructive pneumonia (PNA).
3. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient has developed sinus tachycardia, which may be secondary to respiratory distress, dehydration, or pain. He also has evidence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy, which may require further monitoring and management.
4. **Hypotension:** The patient's hypotension may be secondary to dehydration, pain, or infection, and may require further management with pressor support and fluid replacement.
5. **Anemia and Thrombocytopenia:** The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may be secondary to anemia of chronic disease, and may require further management with transfusions and monitoring.
6. **Hyponatremia:** The patient's hyponatremia may be secondary to SIADH or hypovolemia, and may require further management with fluid replacement and monitoring.
7. **Respiratory Distress:** The patient's respiratory distress may worsen if his lung mass is not adequately managed, and may require further management with oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
2. Manage the patient's pain and discomfort with analgesics and sedation as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust fluid replacement as necessary.
4. Consider further imaging studies, such as a head MRI, to rule out bleeding or tumor involvement.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's blood counts and adjust transfusions as necessary.
6. Consider further management of the patient's lung mass, such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy, to improve his respiratory status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 12347**] [**Last Name (Titles) 12348**] is a 44 yo male with a newly diagnosed lung mass
   admitted with SOB likely secondary to compression of airway by lung
   mass.
   .
   1.  SOB.  SOB is likely secondary to large lung mass with compression
   of bronchus.  CTA negative for PE.  Echo showed apical akinesis with EF
   of 35% but cardiac cath was negative for CAD.  Patient is s/p rigid
   bronch with biopsy and stent placement.  No current evidence of
   pneumonia.  ?small pneumomediastinum noted on CXR also noted following
   stent placement and biopsy now no longer on CXR.   His respiratory
   status decompensated and had hypoxia/hypercapnia, with altered mental
   status.  Intubated on [**2-22**] for AMS and the need for radiation, MRI.
   there was some trauma and febrile temps on [**2-22**] as well as mild bump in
   WBC
   - D1 of vanc/cefepime in [**2-22**], continue as long as intubate
   - aim to remove sedation, using propofol bridge
   - radiation to resume on monday
   .
   # Hypotension - patient became hypotension with sedation and
   ventilation. Requires Levophed
   - wean sedation
   - treat possible infection
   - pressor support as needed
   .
   2.  Lung mass.  S/p biopsy by rigid bronch. Prior pathology suggestive
   of NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, but not conclusive.  Lung mass is likely the
   source of patient's SOB and therefor would benefit from XRT.
   - onc following
   - continue XRT
   - tracheal stent placed, will be rm
d after XRT done
   - f/u on pathology both in house and OSH.
   .
   3. altered mental status: agitation and combativeness was noted,
   thought to be a combination of medication induced, metabolic
   abnormality, possible a component coping mechanism.
   - r/o bleed or tumor involvment by MRI of head
   - sedation on ventilator for treatment
   .
   4.  Hyponatremia.  Patient had altered mental status and hyponatrmia.
   Renal feels this is consistent with siadh +/- hypovelemia. It resolved
   with fluid replacement
   - trend Na
   .
   5.  Tachycardia.  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to dehydration.  Also possibilty
   secondary to pain (though appears comfortable at present).  [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to large lung mass and also possibly secondary to the
   pneumomediastinum.
   - monitor on tele, ivf boluses
   - pain control
   - could be [**12-23**] infection, follow Bcx
   .
   6.  Leukocytosis.  No clear evidence of infection, but at risk for
   post-obstructive PNA.  WBC trending down without antibiotics. Likely
   secondary to prednisone use prior to admission for ?back pain.
   - f/u cultures
   .
   7.  Takotsubo.  EKG with ST elevations, but cardiac cath negative.
   Echo also showed extensive anteroapical akinesis with EF of 35%.  This
   is likely secondary to tkotsubo cardiomyotathy.
   - follow up as opt for echo
   .
   8.  Anemia/thrombocytopenia.  Baseline Hct/plt unknown and no clear
   source of bleeding. Likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease. Plt
   decrease could be
   - trend Hct, plt
   - transfuse as needed, goal hct > 26, plt >30
   .
   9. Sinus tachycardia.  Likely secondary to respiratory distress +/-
   dehydration.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   10.  Back pain.  Back pain is secondary to pathological L4 fracture and
   invasion of T11, T12 and L5 with metastatic disease.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old male with a newly diagnosed lung mass, admitted with shortness of breath (SOB) likely secondary to compression of the airway by the lung mass. He underwent rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and stent placement, and was intubated due to respiratory decompensation and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including:

1. Hypotension: requiring pressor support and treatment of possible infection.
2. Lung mass: likely NSCLC, adenocarcinoma, with tracheal stent placement and plans for radiation therapy.
3. Altered mental status: likely secondary to medication-induced, metabolic abnormality, and possible coping mechanism.
4. Hyponatremia: resolved with fluid replacement.
5. Tachycardia: likely secondary to dehydration, pain, or the large lung mass.
6. Leukocytosis: trending down without antibiotics, likely secondary to prednisone use prior to admission.
7. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: likely secondary to stress-induced cardiomyopathy.
8. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: likely secondary to anemia of chronic disease and possible bleeding.
9. Sinus tachycardia: likely secondary to respiratory distress and dehydration.
10. Back pain: secondary to pathological L4 fracture and invasion of T11, T12, and L5 with metastatic disease.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: due to post-obstructive lung disease or aspiration.
2. Infection: secondary to the lung mass or other comorbidities.
3. Cardiac complications: due to takotsubo cardiomyopathy or other cardiac conditions.
4. Bleeding: due to anemia, thrombocytopenia, or other bleeding disorders.
5. Respiratory failure: due to worsening lung disease or other respiratory complications.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: due to dehydration, pain, or other gastrointestinal conditions.
7. Metabolic complications: due to hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, or other metabolic disorders.
8. Neurological complications: due to altered mental status, seizures, or other neurological conditions.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy for possible infection.
2. Monitor for signs of pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
3. Manage pain and discomfort with analgesics and sedatives.
4. Monitor and manage electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyponatremia.
5. Monitor and manage cardiac function, particularly takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
6. Monitor and manage anemia and thrombocytopenia.
7. Monitor and manage back pain.
8. Consider radiation therapy for the lung mass.
9. Consider further diagnostic testing, such as MRI or CT scans, to rule out other conditions.
10. Consider consults with specialists, such as pulmonology, cardiology, and oncology, to optimize care."
