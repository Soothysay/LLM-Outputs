   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 27 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 2U PRBCs today on [**7-29**] : 21.7 --> 23.9
   -Continue holding Heparin gtt and coumadin given continued bleeding
   into gluteal hematoma
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal currently since off heparin
   gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   -Re-assess risk/benefit of anticoagulation daily and re-start Heparin
   without bolus and at lower end of therapeutic range once bleeding more
   stable
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/40's with
   active bleeding into hematoma.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a recent right hip hemiarthroplasty and re-started on heparin gtt post-op due to a mechanical aortic valve. The patient developed a gluteal hematoma, which was identified on abdominal CT scan, and has been bleeding actively. 

The patient has presented with several complications, including:

1. Acute Anemia: Due to the gluteal hematoma, the patient's hemoglobin levels have dropped, and they are at risk for further bleeding. The patient is on hold for anticoagulation until the anemia stabilizes.

2. Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension: The patient's baseline blood pressure runs in the 90's-100's, and currently, they are experiencing hypotension (80's/40's) due to active bleeding into the hematoma.

3. Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a recent echo demonstrating an EF of 45%. They appear well-compensated and near euvolemic, but are at risk for further cardiac complications.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has improved gradually following a hypotensive episode earlier in their admission. They are at risk for further kidney damage due to the ongoing bleeding.

5. Delirium: The patient has been reported to be confused and disoriented, with a head CT scan showing no evidence of bleed or interval change.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Increased bleeding: The patient's continued bleeding into the gluteal hematoma puts them at risk for further anemia, hypotension, and potential cardiac complications.

2. Cardiac complications: The patient's ischemic cardiomyopathy and ongoing bleeding put them at risk for further cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest.

3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if they continue to experience hypotension and bleeding.

4. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing bleeding and potential infections increase their risk for developing sepsis.

5. Neurological complications: The patient's delirium and potential for further bleeding into the gluteal hematoma put them at risk for neurological complications, including compartment syndrome.

Based on these complications and potential medical complications, the patient's care plan should focus on:

1. Continuing to monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels and bleeding status.

2. Holding anticoagulation therapy until the bleeding stabilizes.

3. Maintaining cardiovascular stability through IVF resuscitation and telemonitoring.

4. Continuing to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as needed.

5. Maintaining glycemic control and nutrition.

6. Monitoring the patient's renal function and adjusting therapy as needed.

7. Continuing to manage the patient's delirium with frequent reorientation, avoiding narcotics, and using Haldol as needed.

8. Monitoring the patient's neurological status and adjusting therapy as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 27 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 2U PRBCs today on [**7-29**] : 21.7 --> 23.9
   -Continue holding Heparin gtt and coumadin given continued bleeding
   into gluteal hematoma. No heparin since yesterday at noon
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21. HCT stable at this time
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal currently since off heparin
   gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   -Re-assess risk/benefit of anticoagulation daily and re-start Heparin
   without bolus and at lower end of therapeutic range once bleeding more
   stable. Will discuss this issue with cards
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/40's with
   active bleeding into hematoma.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Consider starting mild diuresis this evening if BP
   stable.
   -Continue Statin
   -Bblocker on hold until acute issues resolve
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-inch tall individual with a weight not specified, who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to a recent right hip hemiarthroplasty and mechanical aortic valve. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, unknown, and morphine, and has been experiencing confusion and delirium.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure of 88/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient has a right gluteal hematoma, which was detected on a computed tomography (CT) scan, and has received a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since July 28. The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 23.3 g/dL to 21.7 g/dL, and the patient is currently off heparin and coumadin due to active bleeding.

The patient has acute anemia due to the right gluteal hematoma, and anticoagulation is being held until the anemia stabilizes. The patient's hemoglobin level is being checked every 6 hours, and PRBCs are being transfused to keep the hemoglobin level above 21. The patient's coagulation parameters, including the international normalized ratio (INR), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), are being monitored daily.

The patient has a mechanical aortic valve and is off anticoagulation due to active bleeding. The patient's INR is subtherapeutic, and the patient is being monitored daily for bleeding and re-started on heparin without a bolus and at a lower end of the therapeutic range once bleeding is more stable.

The patient has hypotension and orthostatic hypotension, and is being monitored closely for changes in blood pressure. The patient's baseline blood pressure runs in the 90's-100's, and is currently in the 80's-40's with active bleeding.

The patient has ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 45%, and is being monitored closely for changes in cardiac status. The patient's blood pressure is being closely monitored, and mild diuresis may be started if the blood pressure is stable.

The patient has acute renal failure, which is improving gradually following a hypotensive episode earlier in the admission. The patient's creatinine level is being monitored daily, and the goal is to keep the input/output (I/O) even to slight negative to maintain kidney perfusion.

The patient has delirium, which has improved somewhat since discharge from the medical intensive care unit (MICU) several days ago. The patient is still reportedly confused per family, and is being monitored closely for changes in mental status.

The patient has coronary artery disease (CAD), and is being monitored closely for changes in cardiac status. The patient's aspirin and beta-blocker therapy are being held due to active bleeding, and statin therapy is being continued.

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and the patient's disposition is ICU."

   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 27 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 2U PRBCs today on [**7-29**] : 21.7 --> 23.9
   -Continue holding Heparin gtt and coumadin given continued bleeding
   into gluteal hematoma
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal currently since off heparin
   gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   -Re-assess risk/benefit of anticoagulation daily and re-start Heparin
   without bolus and at lower end of therapeutic range once bleeding more
   stable
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/40's with
   active bleeding into hematoma.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-inch tall male with a history of mechanical aortic valve, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and acute renal failure, admitted to the ICU due to a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic hypotension. The patient has developed a right gluteal hematoma, which has led to anemia and hypotension. He is currently on hold for anticoagulation and has had three units of packed red blood cells transfused. The patient's labs show anemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypovolemic shock: Due to the ongoing bleeding into the gluteal hematoma, the patient is at risk of developing hypovolemic shock, which could lead to cardiovascular instability and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure is worsening, and the ongoing bleeding may exacerbate this condition, potentially leading to further kidney damage.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's mechanical aortic valve and ischemic cardiomyopathy make him susceptible to cardiovascular instability, which could be exacerbated by the ongoing bleeding and hypotension.
4. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and a potential source of infection in the gluteal hematoma, which could lead to sepsis and further complicate the patient's condition.
5. Compartment syndrome: The patient's gluteal hematoma may be compressing surrounding tissues, potentially leading to compartment syndrome, which could cause further tissue damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen due to the ongoing bleeding, pain, and potential for further complications, which could impact his overall quality of life and ability to recover.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may be compromised due to the ongoing bleeding, hypotension, and potential for further complications, which could lead to respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which could exacerbate his anemia and worsen his overall condition.
9. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's ongoing bleeding and hypotension may lead to hemodynamic instability, which could further complicate his condition and potentially lead to life-threatening complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 74 yo M with Mechanical Aortic Valve who was anticoagulated
   after ortho surgery and bled into his hip resulting in hct drop and R
   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 29.5 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs today on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2
   -Restart Heparin gtt and continue to hold coumadin given continued
   bleeding into gluteal hematoma but medical need for anticoagulation
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21. HCT stable at this time
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. Restarted heparin gtt today. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal
   currently since off heparin gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Will not diurese today as BP is too low.
   -Continue Statin
   -Bblocker on hold until acute issues resolve
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who underwent ortho surgery and bled into his hip, resulting in a hematoma and anemia. The patient's current condition is:

* Hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 75 mmHg and a mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the 40s
* Hematocrit (Hct) stable, but with a recent drop in Hct from 24.4 to 24.2 after transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs)
* Right gluteal hematoma with a significant size difference between the right and left legs
* Atrial fibrillation (AF) with a heart rate of 82 beats per minute (bpm)
* Respiratory support: oxygen delivery device not in use, SpO2 of 94%, and ABG of 19 mmHg
* Neurologic: altered mental status with confusion and delirium
* Laboratory results: Hct of 24.2%, white blood cell (WBC) count of 14.1 K/uL, platelet (Plt) count of 655 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.7 mg/dL, and glucose of 114 mg/dL

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's bleeding into his hip has resulted in a significant hematoma and anemia. The patient's INR is subtherapeutic, and he is at risk for further bleeding.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotensive episode may be related to his bleeding, and he may be at risk for further episodes.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's recent hypotensive episode may have contributed to his acute renal failure, which is improving gradually.
4. Ischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient has a recent echo demonstrating an ejection fraction (EF) of 45%, which may be contributing to his hypotension and cardiac symptoms.
5. Delirium: The patient has a history of delirium, which may be exacerbated by his current medical condition and medications.
6. Compartment syndrome: The patient's right gluteal hematoma may be at risk for developing compartment syndrome, which could lead to further complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Restarting heparin gtt and holding coumadin until bleeding issues stabilize
* Serial exams to evaluate for compartment syndrome
* Monitoring for signs of foot drop and potential hematoma evacuation
* Transfusing PRBCs to maintain Hct >21
* Holding ACE inhibitors and statins until bleeding stabilizes
* Continuing IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
* Monitoring for signs of volume overload and adjusting diuretic therapy as needed
* Continuing statin therapy
* Holding ASA and BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
* Monitoring for signs of acute renal failure and adjusting diuretic therapy as needed
* Continuing frequent reorientation and avoiding narcotics for pain
* Monitoring for signs of delirium and adjusting therapy as needed"

   Assessment and Plan
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 27 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 2U PRBCs today on [**7-29**] : 21.7 --> 23.9
   -Continue holding Heparin gtt and coumadin given continued bleeding
   into gluteal hematoma. No heparin since yesterday at noon
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21. HCT stable at this time
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal currently since off heparin
   gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   -Re-assess risk/benefit of anticoagulation daily and re-start Heparin
   without bolus and at lower end of therapeutic range once bleeding more
   stable. Will discuss this issue with cards
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/40's with
   active bleeding into hematoma.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Consider starting mild diuresis this evening if BP
   stable.
   -Continue Statin
   -Bblocker on hold until acute issues resolve
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

   Assessment and Plan
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 27 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 2U PRBCs today on [**7-29**] : 21.7 --> 23.9
   -Continue holding Heparin gtt and coumadin given continued bleeding
   into gluteal hematoma. No heparin since yesterday at noon
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21. HCT stable at this time
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal currently since off heparin
   gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   -Re-assess risk/benefit of anticoagulation daily and re-start Heparin
   without bolus and at lower end of therapeutic range once bleeding more
   stable. Will discuss this issue with cards
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/40's with
   active bleeding into hematoma.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Consider starting mild diuresis this evening if BP
   stable.
   -Continue Statin
   -Bblocker on hold until acute issues resolve
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-inch tall, 104.1 kg individual with a recent right hip hemiarthroplasty and re-started on heparin gtt post-op due to a mechanical aortic valve. The patient has developed a gluteal hematoma, which is causing active bleeding and hypotension. The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level has dropped significantly, and they have received a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) since admission.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure of 90/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient's cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and their central venous pressure (CVP) is 13 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.1, hemoglobin level of 24.2%, and platelet count of 655. Their liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 55, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 57, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level of 236. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Continued holding of heparin gtt and coumadin due to active bleeding into the gluteal hematoma.
2. Serial exams to evaluate for compartment syndrome, with orthopedic follow-up.
3. If the patient develops foot drop, contact orthopedic for possible hematoma evacuation.
4. Acute anemia due to the gluteal hematoma, with anticoagulation on hold until anemia stabilizes.
5. Hct check every 6 hours, with transfusion of PRBCs to keep Hct >21.
6. Check coagulation daily, with no need for fresh frozen plasma (FFP) unless Hct drop becomes more acute or the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleeding.
7. Mechanical aortic valve: continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stabilize, and reassess risk/benefit of anticoagulation daily.
8. Hypotension/orthostatic hypotension: continue telemonitoring, hold beta blocker until bleeding stabilizes, and provide IVF resuscitation as needed.
9. Ischemic cardiomyopathy: continue monitoring BP this afternoon, consider starting mild diuresis this evening if BP is stable.
10. Acute renal failure: continue to monitor BMP daily, with goal to keep I/O even to slight negative to maintain kidney perfusion.
11. Delirium: frequent reorientation, avoid narcotics for pain, and use tramadol prn.
12. CAD: hold ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma, hold beta blocker given hypotension/active bleeding, and continue statin therapy.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Continued bleeding into the gluteal hematoma, which may lead to further hypotension, anemia, and potential compartment syndrome.
2. Development of acute kidney injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome due to hypotension and bleeding.
3. Worsening of ischemic cardiomyopathy, potentially leading to cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
4. Delirium may worsen or become more difficult to manage due to ongoing bleeding and hypotension.
5. Potential for further bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hematuria, due to ongoing anticoagulation and platelet dysfunction."

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo male s/p right hip ORIF complicated by post operative bleeding
   and admit to ICU with significant hemorrhage.  This was in the setting
   of required anticoagulation in the setting of mechanical valve
   replacement.  He now has moderate and persistent bleeding noted
   requiring 1 unit in past 24 hours.  Heparin held since 1pm on [**2128-7-29**].
   He has evidence of significant hemorrhage and external exam
although
   reassuring for no evidence of evolution of compartment syndrome.
 HEMORRHAGE/HEMATOMA, PROCEDURE-RELATED (E.G., CATH, PACEMAKER, ICD
   BLEED)
   -he has HCT that showed minimal response to 1 unit PRBC
   -Concern for ongoing blood loss is real with ongoing blood loss
   suggested by the limited increase in HCT with transfusion.
   -Will continue HCT check q 4 hours today.
   -
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 VALVE REPLACEMENT, AORTIC MECHANICAL (AVR)
   -Goal to return to anticoagulation at earliest possible time.
   -If HCT continued stable at next check will restart systemic
   anticoagulation and continue to monitor at frequent intervals.
   -Heparin with no bolus
 HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
   -Much improved this morning on exam
   -Likely multifactorial delirum
   -Haldol PRN
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   -Modest improvement with Cr decreased with blood pressure stability and
   adequate perfusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent right hip ORIF and developed post-operative bleeding, requiring admission to the ICU. He has a history of mechanical valve replacement and required anticoagulation, which was held due to bleeding. The patient has received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) in the past 24 hours and has evidence of significant hemorrhage. His hemoglobin (HCT) level has shown minimal response to transfusion, indicating ongoing blood loss. The patient is at risk for ongoing blood loss, anemia, and potential complications such as compartment syndrome, hypotension, pain, delirium, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ongoing bleeding: The patient's HCT level has shown minimal response to transfusion, indicating ongoing blood loss. This may lead to further hemorrhage, anemia, and potential complications.
2. Anemia: The patient's HCT level is 24.2%, which is below the normal range. Anemia may lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
3. Compartment syndrome: The patient's external exam is reassuring for no evidence of evolution of compartment syndrome, but ongoing bleeding may still lead to compartment syndrome, which can cause muscle and nerve damage.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 109/57 mmHg, which is below the normal range. Hypotension may lead to decreased organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
5. Pain: The patient is experiencing acute pain, which may be exacerbated by ongoing bleeding and may lead to decreased mobility and increased risk of complications.
6. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely multifactorial and may be exacerbated by pain, anxiety, and other factors. Delirium may lead to decreased cognitive function, increased risk of falls, and prolonged hospital stay.
7. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.7 mg/dL, which is above the normal range. Renal failure may lead to decreased kidney function, electrolyte imbalances, and potential complications.
8. Heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure and may be at risk for worsening heart failure due to ongoing bleeding, anemia, and potential complications.
9. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and may be at risk for cardiac complications due to ongoing bleeding, anemia, and potential complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his care accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 71-inch tall, 104 kg male admitted to the ICU with a history of aortic mechanical valve replacement, hip fracture, and coronary artery disease. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a nasogastric tube in place. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, and blood pressure of 94/43 mmHg. He is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and pain management medications.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 729 K/uL. His liver enzymes are elevated, and his renal function is impaired. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to his inability to assess certain areas, such as his peripheral vascular and skin. He is currently not able to respond to commands, move, or exhibit tone.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hemorrhage/bleeding: The patient's history of aortic mechanical valve replacement and hip fracture increases his risk of bleeding, which may be exacerbated by his platelet count of 729 K/uL.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL indicates anemia, which may be secondary to blood loss or other underlying conditions.
3. Renal failure: The patient's impaired renal function may worsen if not managed promptly.
4. Heart failure: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and coronary artery disease increases his risk of worsening heart failure.
5. Delirium/confusion: The patient's current state of delirium/confusion may be a result of his underlying medical conditions or medications.
6. Pain control: The patient's acute pain and chronic pain require proper management to prevent complications.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's use of mechanical ventilation increases his risk of developing VAP.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and medical history increase his risk of developing DVT.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness and use of mechanical ventilation increase his risk of developing stress ulcer.
10. Cor pulmonale: The patient's chronic heart failure and respiratory support increase his risk of developing cor pulmonale."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 74 yo M with Mechanical Aortic Valve who was anticoagulated
   after ortho surgery and bled into his hip resulting in hct drop and R
   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 29.5 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs today on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2
   -Restart Heparin gtt and continue to hold coumadin given continued
   bleeding into gluteal hematoma but medical need for anticoagulation
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21. HCT stable at this time
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. Restarted heparin gtt today. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal
   currently since off heparin gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Will not diurese today as BP is too low.
   -Continue Statin
   -Bblocker on hold until acute issues resolve
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 74 yo M with Mechanical Aortic Valve who was anticoagulated
   after ortho surgery and bled into his hip resulting in hct drop and R
   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 29.5 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs today on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2
   -Restart Heparin gtt and continue to hold coumadin given continued
   bleeding into gluteal hematoma but medical need for anticoagulation
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21. HCT stable at this time
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. Restarted heparin gtt today. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal
   currently since off heparin gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Will not diurese today as BP is too low.
   -Continue Statin
   -Bblocker on hold until acute issues resolve
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who was admitted to the ICU after bleeding into his right gluteal hematoma following orthopedic surgery. The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure, and delirium. He is currently being managed for acute anemia, hypotension, and mechanical aortic valve thrombosis.

The patient's recent events include a drop in hemoglobin (Hct) from 25.6 to 23.6, which was managed with a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient's current hemoglobin level is 26.3%. He is currently receiving heparin infusions and is off coumadin due to active bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 94/43 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.1 x 10^9/L, platelet count of 729 x 10^9/L, and creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL. His coagulation studies show an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 29.4 seconds.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Compartment syndrome: The patient's gluteal hematoma could cause compartment syndrome, which requires prompt recognition and management to prevent permanent damage.
2. Hematoma evacuation: The patient may require evacuation of the gluteal hematoma if it continues to expand or causes symptoms such as foot drop.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure could worsen if he becomes hypotensive or if his bleeding is not adequately managed.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium could worsen if he becomes more hypotensive or if his bleeding is not adequately managed.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's mechanical aortic valve thrombosis could lead to cardiac complications such as valve failure or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Infection: The patient's open wounds and recent surgery increase his risk of developing infections, which could worsen his condition.

The patient's plan of care includes restarting heparin infusions, holding coumadin, and monitoring his coagulation studies. He will also be closely monitored for signs of compartment syndrome, hematoma evacuation, and cardiac complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 74 yo M with Mechanical Aortic Valve who was anticoagulated
   after ortho surgery and bled into his hip resulting in hct drop and R
   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 29.5 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs today on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2
   -Restart Heparin gtt and continue to hold coumadin given continued
   bleeding into gluteal hematoma but medical need for anticoagulation
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Anticoagulation on
   hold until anemia stablizes. Pt initially with supratherapeutic INR on
   admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >21. HCT stable at this time
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   Pt off anticoagulation since [**7-28**] given active bleed into R gluteal
   hematoma. Restarted heparin gtt today. INR subtherapeutic, PTT normal
   currently since off heparin gtt.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Continue holding BBlocker until bleeding stabilizes
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Will not diurese today as BP is too low.
   -Continue Statin
   -Bblocker on hold until acute issues resolve
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who underwent orthopedic surgery and developed a right gluteal hematoma. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level dropped from 25.6 to 23.6, and he received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with a subsequent increase in Hct to 26.3.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 76 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 94/43 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has an SpO2 of 98%. His respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6-8 mL/kg and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5-7 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.1 x 10^9/L, platelet count of 729 x 10^9/L, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5. His coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prothrombin time (PT) of 16.9 seconds and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 29.4 seconds.

The patient's physical examination reveals a stable neurological status, with no signs of increased intracranial pressure. His skin is warm and dry, with no evidence of bleeding or bruising. His abdomen is soft and nontender, with no masses or organomegaly.

The patient's medical history includes ischemic cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure, and a history of falls secondary to orthostatic hypotension. He has a known allergy to penicillins and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin.

The patient's current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin, which are being held due to the active bleeding. He is also receiving intravenous fluids, famotidine, and tramadol for pain management.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk of further bleeding into the gluteal hematoma, which could lead to worsening anemia, hypovolemic shock, and even death.
2. Infection: The patient has a risk of developing an infection in the gluteal hematoma, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
3. Thrombosis: The patient's abnormal coagulation profile and anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of developing thrombosis, which could lead to pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or stroke.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's ischemic cardiomyopathy and history of falls secondary to orthostatic hypotension may increase his risk of developing cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and history of hypotensive episodes may increase his risk of developing chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
6. Delirium: The patient's history of delirium and current medication regimen may increase his risk of developing further delirium or cognitive impairment.

In summary, the patient is at risk of developing various medical complications, including bleeding, infection, thrombosis, cardiac complications, renal failure, and delirium. Close monitoring and management of these risks are essential to ensure the patient's safety and optimal outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 74 yo M with Mechanical Aortic Valve who was anticoagulated
   after ortho surgery and bled into his hip resulting in hct drop and R
   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan:
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 29.5 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2. With fall in Hct by 2 points
   last night [**7-31**], stopped gtt and transfused 1 unit
   -Restart Heparin gtt slowly (no bolus doses) and continue to hold
   coumadin given continued bleeding into gluteal hematoma but strong
   medical indication for anticoagulation
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Pt initially with
   supratherapeutic INR on admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin
   K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >24
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   -Restarted heparin gtt yesterday, held overnight and restarted this
   morning recognizing that the hct drop may be an ooze into his hip vs
   bleed from other source
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Start back on BBlocker at low dose
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Will not diurese today as BP is too low.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 74 yo M with Mechanical Aortic Valve who was anticoagulated
   after ortho surgery and bled into his hip resulting in hct drop and R
   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan:
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT.
   currently INR 1.5, PTT 29.5 and pt off gtt since afternoon of [**7-28**].  Pt
   s/p total of 3U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2. With fall in Hct by 2 points
   last night [**7-31**], stopped gtt and transfused 1 unit
   -Restart Heparin gtt slowly (no bolus doses) and continue to hold
   coumadin given continued bleeding into gluteal hematoma but strong
   medical indication for anticoagulation
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Pt initially with
   supratherapeutic INR on admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin
   K prior to hip surgery.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >24
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   -Restarted heparin gtt yesterday, held overnight and restarted this
   morning recognizing that the hct drop may be an ooze into his hip vs
   bleed from other source
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stablize
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Start back on BBlocker at low dose
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. Continue to monitor
   BP this afternoon. Will not diurese today as BP is too low.
   -Continue Statin
   -resume BB at low dose today
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma
   -Holding BBlocker given hypotension/active bleeding
   -Continue statin therapy

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who underwent orthopedic surgery and developed a right gluteal hematoma, resulting in a significant drop in hemoglobin (Hct) levels. The patient was anticoagulated post-operatively due to the mechanical aortic valve, which likely contributed to the bleeding. The patient's hemodynamic status is unstable, with a drop in Hct levels, and is currently receiving blood transfusions to maintain a Hct level above 24.

The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, acute renal failure, and delirium. The patient's cardiac status is being monitored closely, and anticoagulation therapy is being held due to the active bleeding. The patient's renal function is improving, and the goal is to maintain even or slight negative fluid balance to maintain kidney perfusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further bleeding into the gluteal hematoma, which can lead to worsening anemia, hypotension, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Development of compartment syndrome in the affected limb, which can lead to muscle and nerve damage if left untreated.
3. Acute kidney injury or worsening of existing acute renal failure due to inadequate perfusion or volume overload.
4. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or worsening heart failure, due to the patient's underlying cardiomyopathy and anticoagulation therapy.
5. Delirium, which can worsen if not managed properly, and may be exacerbated by the patient's underlying medical conditions and medications.
6. Infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and invasive lines.
7. Thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.

In conclusion, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address the ongoing bleeding, stabilize hemodynamic status, and manage the underlying medical conditions."

   74 yo male s/p ORIF of right hip complicated by local bleeding in the
   setting of required anticoagulation for mechanical valve.  He has had
   HCT at 24 over past two days and with single value of 25.6 would be an
   outlier.  He did not have evidence of hemodynamic insult or change in
   pain at the site or function of the lower extermity and Ortho exam was
   reassuring.
 HEMORRHAGE/HEMATOMA, PROCEDURE-RELATED (E.G., CATH, PACEMAKER, ICD

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male who underwent ORIF of the right hip and is currently in the ICU due to post-operative bleeding. The patient's HCT decreased from 25.6 to 23.6 after starting anticoagulation, but there was no evidence of hemodynamic compromise or change in pain at the site or function of the lower extremity.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Hemorrhage/haematoma: The patient's bleeding may continue to worsen, leading to further complications such as anemia, hypovolemic shock, or even death.
2. Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss: The patient's HCT is already decreased, and further bleeding may exacerbate the anemia, leading to potential complications such as decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
3. Valve replacement, aortic mechanical (AVR): The patient's mechanical valve requires anticoagulation to prevent thrombus formation. Stopping heparin may lead to valve thrombosis, which could be life-threatening.
4. Renal failure, acute (ARF): The patient's blood loss and potential hypovolemia may lead to acute kidney injury or ARF.
5. Heart failure, systolic, chronic: The patient's chronic heart failure may worsen due to the increased risk of valve thrombosis and potential hypovolemia.
6. Coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic heart disease: The patient's CAD may worsen due to the increased risk of valve thrombosis and potential hypovolemia.
7. Delirium/confusion: The patient's mental status may worsen due to the bleeding, hypovolemia, or other complications.
8. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain): The patient may require increased pain management due to the bleeding and potential complications.
9. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure may continue to be unstable due to the bleeding and potential hypovolemia.

To mitigate these risks, the patient's HCT should be closely monitored, and anticoagulation should be continued with careful monitoring of the bleeding site. The patient's pain and mental status should be closely monitored, and pain management and sedation should be adjusted as needed. The patient's fluid status should be closely monitored, and IV fluids should be administered as needed to prevent hypovolemia. The patient's cardiac status should also be closely monitored, and beta blockers should be restarted as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after undergoing ortho surgery and developing a right gluteal hematoma. He has a mechanical aortic valve and was anticoagulated post-op. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level dropped significantly overnight, and he received a total of 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). His international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.5, and his partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is 29.5. The patient is currently being treated with heparin and is being closely monitored for signs of bleeding or compartment syndrome.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's INR is elevated, and he is at risk of bleeding complications, including further bleeding into the gluteal hematoma or bleeding into other areas.
2. Compartment syndrome: The patient is at risk of developing compartment syndrome due to the bleeding into the gluteal hematoma, which could lead to muscle damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct level has dropped significantly, and he may require further transfusions to maintain a stable level.
4. Hypotension/orthostatic hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he may be at risk of developing hypotension or orthostatic hypotension, which could lead to decreased cardiac output and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Ischemic cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, and his current condition may exacerbate this condition.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient has a history of acute renal failure, and his current condition may worsen this condition.
7. Delirium: The patient is at risk of developing delirium due to his underlying medical conditions and the use of sedatives.
8. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac condition and the use of anticoagulants may increase his risk of cardiac arrest.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's Hct level and transfuse PRBCs as necessary to maintain a stable level.
3. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust his fluid management and vasopressor therapy as necessary to maintain a stable blood pressure.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac condition and adjust his cardiac medication as necessary to maintain a stable cardiac output.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his fluid management and diuretic therapy as necessary to maintain a stable renal function.
6. Monitor the patient's delirium and adjust his sedative therapy as necessary to maintain a stable mental status.
7. Consider consulting with a cardiologist or nephrologist to optimize the patient's care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment: 74 yo M with Mechanical Aortic Valve who was anticoagulated
   after ortho surgery and bled into his hip resulting in hct drop and R
   gluteal hematoma.
   Plan:
   #R gluteal hematoma: Pt s/p recent R hip hemiarthroplasty and
   re-started on Heparin gtt post-op given mechanical aortic valve. Was
   noted to have Hct drop of 27.3 --> 23.3 overnight from [**7-27**] to [**7-28**], and
   then subsequently identified to have a gluteal hematoma on abd CT. Pt
   s/p total of 4U PRBCs since [**7-28**] with inappropriate bump in Hct
   following 1U PRBCs on [**7-31**] : 24.4
24.2. Currently INR 1.8, PTT 119 on
   heparin gtt.
   - Heparin gtt  turned down for inc PTT today. continuing to hold
   coumadin and awaiting ortho
s recs on when to restart it.
   -Serial exams to eval for compartment syndrome; Ortho following
   -If pt develops foot drop, contact Ortho for possible hematoma
   evacuation.
   #Acute Anemia - due to R gluteal hematoma as above. Pt initially with
   supratherapeutic INR on admission to OSH prior to transfer, s/p Vitamin
   K prior to hip surgery. Now stable at Hct ~26 on Heparin gtt.
   -Hct check q6
   -Transfuse PRBCs to keep Hct >24
   -Check coags daily, no need for FFP unless Hct drop becomes more acute
   or pt becomes hemodynamically unstable from bleed
   #Mechanical Aortic Valve
   -Restarted heparin gtt [**2128-7-31**] Hct has been stable at ~26 since.
   -Continue holding Coumadin until bleeding issues stabilize. Will f/u
   with ortho re:their recs for this. If ok with them could start tonight
   if PTT normalized at next draw.
    #Fever: could be [**1-24**] line infection vs uti vs surgical site infection
   vs drug fever from keflex
   - Will D/C RIJ today once peripheral IV placed
   - Urine and blood cultures are pending
   -CXR with no change from [**2128-7-28**] with some suggestion of fluid overload
   but no apparent consolidations.
   #Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension
   Initially admitted after a fall secondary to presumed orthostatic
   hypotension. Baseline BP runs 90's-100's, and currently 80's/60's with
   hematoma stabilizing.
   -tele monitoring
   -Started back on BBlocker at low dose for HR control of Afib. [**Month (only) 60**]
   benefit more from Coreg given his cardiac history. Will defer for now
   as patient currently stable on low dose BBlocker.
   -IVF resuscitation as needed to maintain cardiovascular status
   #Ischemic Cardiomyopathy
   Recent echo demonstrated EF of 45%.
   - Current JVD suggests pt may be volume overloaded. SBPs now high 90s.
    Will restart patient
s home dose of spironolactone and consider
   re-adding his bumex as well if continues to be overloaded by exam.
   -Continue Statin
   -No ACE for now given ACE allergy/no [**Last Name (un) 239**] given ARF
   -No nitrates for now
   #Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine 1.3.
   Improving gradually following hypotensive episode earlier this
   admission.
   -Given current active bleeding, goal to keep I/O even to slight neg to
   maintain kidney perfusion
   -Monitor BMP daily
   #Delirium
   Reportedly improved somewhat since recent discharge out of MICU several
   days ago. However, pt still reportedly confused per family.  Head CT on
   [**8-14**], [**7-19**] with no evidence of bleed or interval change.
   -Frequent reorientation
   -Avoid narcotics for pain, tramadol prn
   -Haldol prn hyperactivity or agitation
   #CAD
   -Holding ASA for now given active bleed into hematoma.
   -Continue statin therapy

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a mechanical aortic valve who underwent orthopedic surgery and developed a right gluteal hematoma. He has been anticoagulated with heparin and has had a drop in hemoglobin (Hct) level, which has been stabilized at around 26.

The patient has developed a fever, which could be due to a variety of causes, including a line infection, urinary tract infection, surgical site infection, or drug fever from Keflex. Urine and blood cultures are pending.

The patient has also developed acute anemia due to the right gluteal hematoma and is being transfused with packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to maintain a hemoglobin level of at least 24.

The patient has a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 45% and is at risk for cardiac complications. He has also developed acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.3, which is improving gradually.

The patient is being treated with various medications, including heparin, coumadin, statin, and spironolactone, and is being closely monitored for signs of bleeding, cardiac complications, and kidney dysfunction.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Continued bleeding from the right gluteal hematoma, which could lead to further anemia and cardiac complications.
2. Infection, which could be caused by a variety of factors, including the presence of a central line, urinary catheter, or surgical site.
3. Cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
4. Kidney dysfunction, which could worsen if the patient becomes volume overloaded or if the bleeding continues.
5. Delirium, which could be caused by a variety of factors, including medication, infection, or cardiac complications.
6. Pulmonary complications, including respiratory failure or pneumonia.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management to prevent and treat any potential complications."
