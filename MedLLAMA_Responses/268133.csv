 CARDIAC ARREST - At [**2125-2-6**] 07:32 PM
   -patient with ectopy and multiple short runs of torsades throughout the
   day that were self resolving. She got about 8mg Mag. Because of long
   run in the afternoon EP recommended lidocaine bolus and q4mag. Around
   8pm team called to bedside, had broken out of torsades after shock from
   nurses. Patient again degenerated into torsades despite 4mg Mag. This
   time went into Asystole and code blue was called. Patient received
   chest compressions, 1 shock, epi, atropine and was started on lidocaine
   gtt after bolus. She was also intubated and had return of spontaneous
   circulation. Aline was placed by anesthesia and CVL was placed in
   femoral vein. Levophed was started for low BP.
   -EP came and recommended isoproteronal to target HR>80

   Assessment and Plan
   76-year-old woman with history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   and CVA on warfarin was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes
   after disopyramide initiation and now s/p cardiac arrest in the setting
   of sustained VT.
   s/p Code Blue and Intubation
   Patient had episode of torsades that degenerated into VT last night and
   now stable on levophed and isoproterenol.
   - continue isoproterenol to target HR > 80 and carvedilol to increase
   membrane stability and decrease PVCs
   - wean levophed
   - obtain repeat ECG
   - will need to pull femoral line and place right IJ or subclavian line
   - wean sedation and extubate as soon as possible after right IJ line
   placement
   Torsades
   Patient started on disopyramide on saturday, and torsades is a known
   complication of this medication. Last dose of disopyramide was on [**2-6**]
   AM. Half life of disopyramide is 4-8 hours; so would expect
   disopyramide to be metabolized and at minimal concentrations within 24
   hours of last dose. Patient now back in sinus.
   - daily ECGs
   - continue magnesium q4h
   - continue to hold disopyramide
   - if torsades continues, recommend magnesium push, consideration of
   lidocaine
   - monitor on telemetry
   - appreciate EP recs
   Atrial fibrillation:
   New onset, with rapid ventricular rate, and patient now in sinus. Has
   been asymptomatic.
   - telemetry
   - continue carvedilol
   - heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR
   - hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.
   - IV metoprolol or diltiazem as needed for rapid rates
   [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward secondary to afib
   with RVR.
   - hold losartan and triamterene-HCTZ
   - control RVR as above
   - trend renal labs
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   Rheumatic Heart disease:
   This was diagnosed on this admission via ECHO. patient needs MV
   replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. They will do this
   pending preop work up, including breast biopsy and cardiac
   catherization
   - Cardiac Surgery is following
   - heparin for now
   - will clarify if surgery will be inpatient this admission or as
   outpatient.
   Breast Mass: as seen on recent mammogram
   - patient on heparin gtt here, will try to get breast biopsy as
   inpatient. This was planned for [**2-7**] but will be delayed in the acute
   setting.
   - will call breast imaging to rearrange this after clarifyig that that
   is should be delayed.
   H/o CVA: holding home warfarin, on heparin gtt for now
   - will restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and afib
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - insulin s.s.
   HTN: Patient has a history of hypertension, although currently on
   levophed after the cardiac arrest.
   - holding anti-hypertensives
   - will restart anti-hypertensives as needed
   - wean levophed
   Fluid overload: Likely secondary to MVR. got lasix earlier this
   admission. No history of CHF, EF >55% on ECHO
   - lasix as needed
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now
   Glycemic Control: Regular insulin sliding scale
   Lines:  Right femoral line
   - will pull femoral line and place right subclavian line
   Prophylaxis:
   DVT: (Systemic anticoagulation: Heparin gtt)
   Stress ulcer: PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CVA on warfarin, admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes after disopyramide initiation. She had a cardiac arrest in the setting of sustained VT, and is currently stable on levophed and isoproterenol.

The patient has a complex medical history, including:

* Torsades de pointes, which is a known complication of disopyramide
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, which is likely contributing to her renal impairment
* Rheumatic heart disease, requiring MV replacement and tricuspid repair
* Breast mass, requiring biopsy
* History of CVA, requiring anticoagulation with warfarin
* Diabetes Mellitus Type 2, requiring insulin therapy
* Hypertension, requiring anti-hypertensive therapy

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued torsades de pointes, which can be life-threatening
* Worsening of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, leading to further renal impairment
* Development of cardiac tamponade or pericarditis, which can be life-threatening
* Infection or bleeding complications related to the breast biopsy
* Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, given the patient's history of CVA and rheumatic heart disease
* Fluid overload or congestive heart failure, given the patient's history of hypertension and rheumatic heart disease
* Worsening of diabetes control, leading to hyperglycemia or ketoacidosis

The patient's current medications include:

* Isoproterenol to target HR > 80
* Levophed to support blood pressure
* Heparin gtt for anticoagulation
* Insulin sliding scale for glycemic control
* PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Lasix as needed for fluid overload

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue isoproterenol and levophed to support hemodynamics
* Wean sedation and extubate as soon as possible after right IJ line placement
* Obtain repeat ECG to monitor for torsades de pointes
* Continue magnesium q4h and hold disopyramide
* Monitor on telemetry for atrial fibrillation
* Plan for breast biopsy and cardiac catheterization
* Restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and atrial fibrillation
* Restart anti-hypertensives as needed
* Wean levophed and restart anti-hypertensives as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   76-year-old woman with history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   and CVA on warfarin was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes
   after disopyramide initiation and now s/p cardiac arrest in the setting
   of sustained VT.
   s/p Code Blue and Intubation
   Patient had episode of torsades that degenerated into VT last night and
   now stable on levophed and isoproterenol.
   - continue isoproterenol to target HR > 80 and carvedilol to increase
   membrane stability and decrease PVCs
   - wean levophed
   - obtain repeat ECG
   - will need to pull femoral line and place right IJ or subclavian line
   - wean sedation and extubate as soon as possible after right IJ line
   placement
   Torsades
   Patient started on disopyramide on saturday, and torsades is a known
   complication of this medication. Last dose of disopyramide was on [**2-6**]
   AM. Half life of disopyramide is 4-8 hours; so would expect
   disopyramide to be metabolized and at minimal concentrations within 24
   hours of last dose. Patient now back in sinus.
   - daily ECGs
   - continue magnesium q4h
   - continue to hold disopyramide
   - if torsades continues, recommend magnesium push, consideration of
   lidocaine
   - monitor on telemetry
   - appreciate EP recs
   Atrial fibrillation:
   New onset, with rapid ventricular rate, and patient now in sinus. Has
   been asymptomatic.
   - telemetry
   - continue carvedilol
   - heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR
   - hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.
   - IV metoprolol or diltiazem as needed for rapid rates
   [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward secondary to afib
   with RVR.
   - hold losartan and triamterene-HCTZ
   - control RVR as above
   - trend renal labs
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   Rheumatic Heart disease:
   This was diagnosed on this admission via ECHO. patient needs MV
   replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. They will do this
   pending preop work up, including breast biopsy and cardiac
   catherization
   - Cardiac Surgery is following
   - heparin for now
   - will clarify if surgery will be inpatient this admission or as
   outpatient.
   Breast Mass: as seen on recent mammogram
   - patient on heparin gtt here, will try to get breast biopsy as
   inpatient. This was planned for [**2-7**] but will be delayed in the acute
   setting.
   - will call breast imaging to rearrange this after clarifyig that that
   is should be delayed.
   H/o CVA: holding home warfarin, on heparin gtt for now
   - will restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and afib
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - insulin s.s.
   HTN: Patient has a history of hypertension, although currently on
   levophed after the cardiac arrest.
   - holding anti-hypertensives
   - will restart anti-hypertensives as needed
   - wean levophed
   Fluid overload: Likely secondary to MVR. got lasix earlier this
   admission. No history of CHF, EF >55% on ECHO
   - lasix as needed
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now
   Glycemic Control: Regular insulin sliding scale
   Lines:  Right femoral line
   - will pull femoral line and place right subclavian line
   Prophylaxis:
   DVT: (Systemic anticoagulation: Heparin gtt)
   Stress ulcer: PPI

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   another episode of TdP last night, re-loaded with magnesium, and
   started on Isuprel.  This morning, she is intubated, but no further
   arrhythmia overnight.  QTc still ~540 ms [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] 90
   Physical Examination
   Intubated, sedated, responsive
   Loud MR murmur at apex
   Lungs clear
   No edema
   Warm extremities
   Medical Decision Making
   - femoral line out, place RIK triple-lumen
   - hold [**Last Name (un) 284**]
   - continue MgSO4 and Isuprel
   - wean off norepinephrine
   - extubate later today
   - breast biopsy, and (if negative for CA), cath for preop MVR/TV repair
   - eventually

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   and CVA on warfarin was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes
   after disopyramide initiation and now s/p cardiac arrest in the setting
   of sustained VT.
   s/p Code Blue and Intubation
   Patient had episode of torsades that degenerated into VT last night and
   now stable on levophed and isoproterenol.
   - continue isoproterenol to target HR > 80 and carvedilol to increase
   membrane stability and decrease PVCs
   - wean levophed
   - obtain repeat ECG
   - will need to pull femoral line and place right IJ or subclavian line
   - wean sedation and extubate as soon as possible after right IJ line
   placement
   Torsades
   Patient started on disopyramide on saturday, and torsades is a known
   complication of this medication. Last dose of disopyramide was on [**2-6**]
   AM. Half life of disopyramide is 4-8 hours; so would expect
   disopyramide to be metabolized and at minimal concentrations within 24
   hours of last dose. Patient now back in sinus.
   - daily ECGs
   - continue magnesium q4h
   - continue to hold disopyramide
   - if torsades continues, recommend magnesium push, consideration of
   lidocaine
   - monitor on telemetry
   - appreciate EP recs
   Atrial fibrillation:
   New onset, with rapid ventricular rate, and patient now in sinus. Has
   been asymptomatic.
   - telemetry
   - continue carvedilol
   - heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR
   - hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.
   - IV metoprolol or diltiazem as needed for rapid rates
   [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward secondary to afib
   with RVR.
   - hold losartan and triamterene-HCTZ
   - control RVR as above
   - trend renal labs
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   Rheumatic Heart disease:
   This was diagnosed on this admission via ECHO. patient needs MV
   replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. They will do this
   pending preop work up, including breast biopsy and cardiac
   catherization
   - Cardiac Surgery is following
   - heparin for now
   - will clarify if surgery will be inpatient this admission or as
   outpatient.
   Breast Mass: as seen on recent mammogram
   - patient on heparin gtt here, will try to get breast biopsy as
   inpatient. This was planned for [**2-7**] but will be delayed in the acute
   setting.
   - will call breast imaging to rearrange this after clarifyig that that
   is should be delayed.
   H/o CVA: holding home warfarin, on heparin gtt for now
   - will restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and afib
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - insulin s.s.
   HTN: Patient has a history of hypertension, although currently on
   levophed after the cardiac arrest.
   - holding anti-hypertensives
   - will restart anti-hypertensives as needed
   - wean levophed
   Fluid overload: Likely secondary to MVR. got lasix earlier this
   admission. No history of CHF, EF >55% on ECHO
   - lasix as needed
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now
   Glycemic Control: Regular insulin sliding scale
   Lines:  Right femoral line
   - will pull femoral line and place right subclavian line
   Prophylaxis:
   DVT: (Systemic anticoagulation: Heparin gtt)

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CVA on warfarin, who was admitted to the ICU with torsade de pointes after disopyramide initiation. She had a cardiac arrest in the setting of sustained VT, was intubated, and is currently stable on levophed and isoproterenol. The patient has a history of rheumatic heart disease and requires MV replacement and tricuspid repair, which is pending preop work-up. She also has a breast mass and is on heparin gtt.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient is at risk for recurrent torsade de pointes due to the continued presence of disopyramide and the need for further management of her arrhythmias.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient is at risk for another cardiac arrest due to the continued presence of arrhythmias and the need for further management of her cardiac condition.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient is at risk for respiratory complications due to her intubation and the need for further management of her respiratory status.
4. Renal Complications: The patient is at risk for renal complications due to her history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, as well as her current treatment with heparin and losartan.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her intubation and the need for further management of her respiratory status.
6. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to her treatment with heparin and losartan.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient is at risk for cardiovascular complications due to her history of rheumatic heart disease and the need for further management of her cardiac condition.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient is at risk for neurological complications due to her history of CVA and the need for further management of her neurological status.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and arrhythmias closely.
2. Continue to manage the patient's cardiac condition with levophed and isoproterenol.
3. Wean the patient off norepinephrine and extubate as soon as possible.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her treatment as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her treatment as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and adjust her treatment as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust her treatment as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular and neurological status and adjust her treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's cardiac status is concerning, with a history of ectopy, torsades de pointes, and ventricular tachycardia. The patient received a lidocaine bolus and is being treated with isoproterenol to target a heart rate of >80 bpm. The patient's current heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with invasive ventilation initiated and an arterial line placed. The patient's oxygenation is adequate, with an SpO2 of 100%, and their ventilation is being supported with a Vt of 550 mL.

The patient's hemodynamic status is also concerning, with a blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg and a need for vasopressor support with norepinephrine. The patient's fluid balance is being monitored, with a total fluid intake of 1,051 mL and a total fluid output of 1,270 mL.

The patient's laboratory results are concerning, with a white blood cell count of 15.0 K/uL, a hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, and a platelet count of 429 K/uL. The patient's troponin-T level is elevated at 0.02 ng/mL, indicating possible myocardial injury.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of torsades de pointes and ventricular tachycardia puts them at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for invasive ventilation and high oxygen requirements increases their risk of respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient's need for anticoagulation with heparin and vasopressor support with norepinephrine increases their risk of bleeding complications.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 20 mg/dL may indicate impending renal failure.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and lack of response to stimuli may indicate neurological complications such as cerebral edema or infarction.
7. Infectious complications: The patient's need for invasive lines and tubes increases their risk of infectious complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

In summary, the patient is a critically ill individual who requires close monitoring and management to address their cardiac, respiratory, and hemodynamic instability. The patient's laboratory results are concerning, and potential medical complications may arise if not addressed promptly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and rheumatic heart disease. She was admitted with new-onset atrial fibrillation and was started on disopyramide, which caused torsades de pointes. She had a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated, and was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. She was also started on heparin and lidocaine. Her current vital signs are stable, but she is at risk for further cardiac complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest was likely caused by torsades de pointes, which is a known complication of disopyramide. She is at risk for further cardiac arrests if her torsades de pointes persists.
2. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's ventricular tachycardia is a potential complication of her atrial fibrillation and may lead to further cardiac complications.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation may lead to heart failure, which could exacerbate her respiratory and cardiac symptoms.
4. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen if her heart failure worsens or if she develops further cardiac complications.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if her pulmonary edema worsens or if she develops further cardiac complications.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen if she develops further cardiac complications or if her blood pressure is not adequately controlled.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her prolonged hospitalization and the presence of central lines and invasive devices.
8. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to her heparin therapy and her cardiac catheterization.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and she requires close monitoring and treatment. Her disopyramide should be discontinued, and she should be treated with magnesium for torsades de pointes. She should also be treated with lidocaine for ventricular tachycardia. Her atrial fibrillation should be monitored and treated with telemetry and medication as needed. Her rheumatic heart disease should be managed with cardiac surgery, and her breast mass should be biopsied as soon as possible. Her diabetes mellitus type 2 should be managed with insulin and her hypertension should be managed with medication. Her fluid overload should be managed with lasix, and her cardiac diet should be continued. Her ICU care should include close monitoring of her vital signs, cardiac rhythm, and laboratory results."

   Torsades: patient started on disopyramide on saturday, and torsades is
   a known complication of this medication. Patient back in sinus with
   magnesium. Half life of disopyramide is 4.5-8 hours, but this may be
   delayed given the patients renal failure
   - discontinue disopyramide
   - give magnesiun as needed for torsades
   - if torsades continues despite magnesium, shock if unstable, overdrive
   pace at 100 if stable.
   - monitor on telemetry
   Atrial fibrillation: new onset, with rapid ventricular rate, patient
   now in sinus. Has been asymptomatic. some pulmonary edema on admission.
   History of hypothyroidism, on replacement, TSH normal in [**2124-10-23**]. No
   excessive alcohol or caffeine.

   - continue carvedilol
   - heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR
   - hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.
   - IV metoprolol or diltiazem as needed for rapid rates
   [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward secondary to
   afib with RVR.
   - hold losartan and triamterene-HCTZ
   - control RVR as above
   - trend renal labs
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   Rheumatic Heart disease: This was diagnosed on this admission via ECHO.
   patient needs MV replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. They
   will do this pending preop work up, including breast biopsy and cardiac
   catherization
   - Cardiac Surgery is following
   - heparin for now
   - will clarify if surgery will be inpatient this admission or as
   outpatient.
   Breast Mass: as seen on recent mammogram
   - patient on heparin gtt here, will try to get breast biopsy as
   inpatient. This was planned for [**2-7**], but may have to be delayed given
   torsades.
   - will call breast imaging to rearrange this after clarifyig that that
   is should be delayed.
   H/o CVA: holding home warfarin, on heparin gtt for now
   - will restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and afib
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - insulin s.s.
   HTN: currently slightly hypertensive 140/96. will monitor for now.
   Fluid overload: Likely secondary to MVR. got lasix earlier this
   admission. No history of CHF, EF >55% on ECHO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 76-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and previous cerebrovascular accident, was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to new onset atrial fibrillation and torsades de pointes (TdP). She had been started on disopyramide for atrial fibrillation, which caused TdP. She was given magnesium to treat TdP, and later, lidocaine was added to the treatment regimen. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and was successfully resuscitated. She was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. Her cardiac rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Torsades de pointes (TdP) - a known complication of disopyramide therapy, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
2. Cardiac arrest - the patient has already experienced a cardiac arrest and requires close monitoring to prevent future episodes.
3. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) - a potential complication of TdP, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
4. Pulmonary edema - the patient has a history of pulmonary edema on admission, which can worsen with further fluid overload.
5. Renal failure - the patient has renal failure, which can worsen with further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance.
6. Electrolyte imbalance - the patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and magnesium, are abnormal, which can exacerbate cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Hypothyroidism - the patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which can affect cardiac function and increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Breast cancer - the patient has a breast mass that requires biopsy, which may be delayed due to her cardiac condition.
9. Cardiovascular surgery - the patient requires mitral valve replacement and tricuspid repair, which may be delayed due to her cardiac condition.
10. Infection - the patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly pneumonia and sepsis, due to her compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization."

   Assessment and Plan
   76-year-old woman with h/o DM2, HTN, HL, CVA on warfarin with new onset
   atrial fibrillation, started on disopyramide with torsades this morning
   Torsades: patient started on disopyramide on saturday, and torsades is
   a known complication of this medication. Patient back in sinus with
   magnesium. Half life of disopyramide is 4.5-8 hours, but this may be
   delayed given the patients renal failure
   - discontinue disopyramide
   - give magnesiun as needed for torsades
   - if torsades continues despite magnesium, shock if unstable, overdrive
   pace at 100 if stable.
   - monitor on telemetry
   Atrial fibrillation: new onset, with rapid ventricular rate, patient
   now in sinus. Has been asymptomatic. some pulmonary edema on admission.
   History of hypothyroidism, on replacement, TSH normal in [**2124-10-23**]. No
   excessive alcohol or caffeine.
   - telemetry
   - continue carvedilol
   - heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR
   - hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.
   - IV metoprolol or diltiazem as needed for rapid rates
   [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward secondary to
   afib with RVR.
   - hold losartan and triamterene-HCTZ
   - control RVR as above
   - trend renal labs
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   Rheumatic Heart disease: This was diagnosed on this admission via ECHO.
   patient needs MV replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. They
   will do this pending preop work up, including breast biopsy and cardiac
   catherization
   - Cardiac Surgery is following
   - heparin for now
   - will clarify if surgery will be inpatient this admission or as
   outpatient.
   Breast Mass: as seen on recent mammogram
   - patient on heparin gtt here, will try to get breast biopsy as
   inpatient. This was planned for [**2-7**], but may have to be delayed given
   torsades.
   - will call breast imaging to rearrange this after clarifyig that that
   is should be delayed.
   H/o CVA: holding home warfarin, on heparin gtt for now
   - will restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and afib
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - insulin s.s.
   HTN: currently slightly hypertensive 140/96. will monitor for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) on warfarin. She was admitted with new-onset atrial fibrillation, which led to torsades de pointes, a known complication of the medication disopyramide. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and was resuscitated, but now requires invasive ventilation, and is being monitored in the ICU.

The patient's current medical condition is characterized by:

* Cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)
* Invasive ventilation
* Cardiac arrhythmias (torsades de pointes)
* Renal failure (Cr 1.5 mg/dL)
* Hypertension (BP 140/96 mmHg)
* Fluid overload (likely secondary to mitral valve replacement)
* Diabetes mellitus type 2
* History of CVA on warfarin
* Rheumatic heart disease requiring mitral valve replacement and tricuspid repair
* Breast mass requiring biopsy

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, which can lead to cardiac arrest
* Renal failure, which can worsen with continued fluid overload
* Hypertension, which can exacerbate cardiac and renal complications
* Fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory failure
* Infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Bleeding complications, particularly from the breast biopsy and cardiac catheterization
* Thrombotic complications, particularly DVT and pulmonary embolism

The patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU to address these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   atrial fibrillation, started on disopyramide with torsades this morning
   S/P asystolic arrest-patient had episode of torsades that degenerated
   into asystole last night. She is
   --continue isoproteronal drip to target HR>80
   -continue levophed
   Torsades: patient started on disopyramide on saturday, and torsades is
   a known complication of this medication. Patient back in sinus with
   magnesium. Half life of disopyramide is 4.5-8 hours, but this may be
   delayed given the patients renal failure
   - discontinue disopyramide
   - if torsades continues despite magnesium, shock if unstable, overdrive
   pace at 100 if stable.
   - monitor on telemetry
   -continue q4 hour magnesium
   Atrial fibrillation: new onset, with rapid ventricular rate, patient
   now in sinus. Has been asymptomatic. some pulmonary edema on admission.
   History of hypothyroidism, on replacement, TSH normal in [**2124-10-23**]. No
   excessive alcohol or caffeine.
   - telemetry
   - continue carvedilol
   - heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR
   - hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.
   - IV metoprolol or diltiazem as needed for rapid rates
   [**Last Name (un) 2406**]: Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward secondary to
   afib with RVR.
   - hold losartan and triamterene-HCTZ
   - control RVR as above
   - trend renal labs
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   Rheumatic Heart disease: This was diagnosed on this admission via ECHO.
   patient needs MV replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. They
   will do this pending preop work up, including breast biopsy and cardiac
   catherization
   - Cardiac Surgery is following
   - heparin for now
   - will clarify if surgery will be inpatient this admission or as
   outpatient.
   Breast Mass: as seen on recent mammogram
   - patient on heparin gtt here, will try to get breast biopsy as
   inpatient. This was planned for [**2-7**], but may have to be delayed given
   torsades.
   - will call breast imaging to rearrange this after clarifyig that that
   is should be delayed.
   H/o CVA: holding home warfarin, on heparin gtt for now
   - will restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and afib
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - insulin s.s.
   HTN: currently slightly hypertensive 140/96. will monitor for now.
   Fluid overload: Likely secondary to MVR. got lasix earlier this
   admission. No history of CHF, EF >55% on ECHO
   - lasix as needed

Summary:

The patient, a 76-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and rheumatic heart disease, was admitted to the ICU due to new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate. She was started on disopyramide, which led to torsades de pointes and eventually cardiac arrest. She was resuscitated and intubated, and is currently on isoproterenol and levophed drips to maintain a heart rate >80 bpm and blood pressure. She is also receiving magnesium to control torsades. The patient has a history of CVA and is on warfarin, which is being held for now. She has a breast mass and is scheduled for a breast biopsy, which may be delayed due to her current condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Torsades de pointes: The patient's current condition is at high risk for recurrent torsades, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's recent cardiac arrest and the presence of torsades de pointes increase the risk of future cardiac arrests.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increase the risk of renal failure.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's history of hypothyroidism and the presence of pulmonary edema on admission increase the risk of pulmonary edema.
5. Bleeding: The patient's use of heparin and warfarin increases the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of cardiac surgery.
6. Infection: The patient's presence in the ICU increases the risk of infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
7. Fluid overload: The patient's history of fluid overload and the presence of pulmonary edema increase the risk of fluid overload.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may exacerbate her cardiac condition and increase the risk of cardiac complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue isoproterenol and levophed drips to maintain a heart rate >80 bpm and blood pressure.
2. Monitor the patient's ECG and vital signs closely for signs of torsades de pointes or cardiac arrest.
3. Consider switching to an alternative anti-arrhythmic medication if torsades de pointes persists.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her medications accordingly.
5. Consider using a pulmonary artery catheter to monitor the patient's cardiac output and pulmonary artery pressure.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medications accordingly.
7. Consider using a stress ulcer prophylaxis medication to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Monitor the patient's fluid status and adjust her fluid management plan accordingly.
9. Consider using a insulin sliding scale to control the patient's blood sugar levels.
10. Monitor the patient's thyroid function and adjust her medication accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   76-year-old woman with history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   and CVA on warfarin was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes
   after disopyramide initiation and now s/p cardiac arrest in the setting
   of sustained VT.
   s/p Code Blue and Intubation
   Patient had episode of torsades that degenerated into VT last night and
   now stable on levophed and isoproterenol.
   - continue isoproterenol to target HR > 80 and carvedilol to increase
   membrane stability and decrease PVCs
   - wean levophed
   - obtain repeat ECG
   - will need to pull femoral line and place right IJ or subclavian line
   - wean sedation and extubate as soon as possible after right IJ line
   placement
   Torsades
   Patient started on disopyramide on saturday, and torsades is a known
   complication of this medication. Last dose of disopyramide was on [**2-6**]
   AM. Half life of disopyramide is 4-8 hours; so would expect
   disopyramide to be metabolized and at minimal concentrations within 24
   hours of last dose. Patient now back in sinus.
   - daily ECGs
   - continue magnesium q4h
   - continue to hold disopyramide
   - if torsades continues, recommend magnesium push, consideration of
   lidocaine
   - monitor on telemetry
   - appreciate EP recs
   Atrial fibrillation:
   New onset, with rapid ventricular rate, and patient now in sinus. Has
   been asymptomatic.
   - telemetry
   - continue carvedilol
   - heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR
   - hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.
   - IV metoprolol or diltiazem as needed for rapid rates
   [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward secondary to afib
   with RVR.
   - hold losartan and triamterene-HCTZ
   - control RVR as above
   - trend renal labs
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   Rheumatic Heart disease:
   This was diagnosed on this admission via ECHO. patient needs MV
   replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. They will do this
   pending preop work up, including breast biopsy and cardiac
   catherization

   setting.
   - will call breast imaging to rearrange this after clarifyig that that
   is should be delayed.
   H/o CVA: holding home warfarin, on heparin gtt for now
   - will restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and afib
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - insulin s.s.
   HTN: Patient has a history of hypertension, although currently on
   levophed after the cardiac arrest.
   - holding anti-hypertensives
   - will restart anti-hypertensives as needed
   - wean levophed
   Fluid overload: Likely secondary to MVR. got lasix earlier this
   admission. No history of CHF, EF >55% on ECHO
   - lasix as needed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   76-year-old woman with history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   and CVA on warfarin was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes
   after disopyramide initiation and now s/p cardiac arrest in the setting
   of sustained VT.
   s/p Code Blue and Intubation
   Patient had episode of torsades that degenerated into VT last night and
   now stable on levophed and isoproterenol.
   - continue isoproterenol to target HR > 80 and carvedilol to increase
   membrane stability and decrease PVCs
   - wean levophed
   - obtain repeat ECG
   - will need to pull femoral line and place right IJ or subclavian line
   - wean sedation and extubate as soon as possible after right IJ line
   placement
   Torsades
   Patient started on disopyramide on saturday, and torsades is a known
   complication of this medication. Last dose of disopyramide was on [**2-6**]
   AM. Half life of disopyramide is 4-8 hours; so would expect
   disopyramide to be metabolized and at minimal concentrations within 24
   hours of last dose. Patient now back in sinus.
   - daily ECGs
   - continue magnesium q4h
   - continue to hold disopyramide
   - if torsades continues, recommend magnesium push, consideration of
   lidocaine
   - monitor on telemetry
   - appreciate EP recs
   Atrial fibrillation:
   New onset, with rapid ventricular rate, and patient now in sinus. Has
   been asymptomatic.
   - telemetry
   - continue carvedilol
   - heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR
   - hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.
   - IV metoprolol or diltiazem as needed for rapid rates
   [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward secondary to afib
   with RVR.
   - hold losartan and triamterene-HCTZ
   - control RVR as above
   - trend renal labs
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   Rheumatic Heart disease:
   This was diagnosed on this admission via ECHO. patient needs MV
   replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. They will do this
   pending preop work up, including breast biopsy and cardiac
   catherization
   - Cardiac Surgery is following
   - heparin for now
   - will clarify if surgery will be inpatient this admission or as
   outpatient.
   Breast Mass: as seen on recent mammogram
   - patient on heparin gtt here, will try to get breast biopsy as
   inpatient. This was planned for [**2-7**] but will be delayed in the acute
   setting.
   - will call breast imaging to rearrange this after clarifyig that that
   is should be delayed.
   H/o CVA: holding home warfarin, on heparin gtt for now
   - will restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and afib
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - insulin s.s.
   HTN: Patient has a history of hypertension, although currently on
   levophed after the cardiac arrest.
   - holding anti-hypertensives
   - will restart anti-hypertensives as needed
   - wean levophed
   Fluid overload: Likely secondary to MVR. got lasix earlier this
   admission. No history of CHF, EF >55% on ECHO
   - lasix as needed
   - consider repeat echo

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CVA, who was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes after disopyramide initiation and subsequently had a cardiac arrest in the setting of sustained VT. She was intubated and stabilized on levophed and isoproterenol. The patient's cardiac rhythm has been converted to sinus, but she still has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate. She has been weaned off levophed and is receiving metoprolol for rate control.

The patient has a number of medical complications, including:

1. Torsades de pointes: A known complication of disopyramide, which has been held.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: The patient is receiving metoprolol for rate control and will need to be anticoagulated with heparin prior to undergoing cardiac catheterization and mitral valve replacement.
3. Fluid overload: The patient has been receiving lasix and will need to be monitored for fluid balance.
4. Diabetes: The patient's oral hypoglycemics have been held and she is receiving insulin.
5. Hypertension: The patient's anti-hypertensives have been held and she will need to be restarted on them once her blood pressure stabilizes.
6. Rheumatic heart disease: The patient has been diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease and will need to undergo mitral valve replacement and tricuspid repair.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening of atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if her rapid ventricular rate is not controlled.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient is at risk for cardiac arrest if her arrhythmias are not controlled.
3. Fluid overload: The patient is at risk for fluid overload if her diuresis is not adequate.
4. Worsening of diabetes: The patient's diabetes may worsen if her oral hypoglycemics are not restarted or if her insulin regimen is not adequate.
5. Worsening of hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if her anti-hypertensives are not restarted or if her blood pressure is not adequately controlled.
6. Complications of cardiac surgery: The patient is at risk for complications related to her cardiac surgery, including bleeding, infection, and arrhythmias."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes after initiation of disopyramide and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest with sustained ventricular tachycardia.

The patient has been extubated and is currently receiving invasive ventilation. She has been weaned off levophed and is being treated with metoprolol, lasix, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 102/64 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%.

The patient has developed atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 160s, which has been treated with metoprolol and is being closely monitored. She has also developed fluid overload, which is being managed with lasix.

The patient has a history of rheumatic heart disease and is being followed by cardiac surgery for potential surgery. She also has a breast mass that needs to be biopsied and is being consulted with surgery.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Worsening atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not well-controlled, and further treatment may be needed to reduce her heart rate and prevent complications.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload is likely to continue if not properly managed, which can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
3. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospital stay and use of invasive lines and devices increase her risk of developing infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of torsade de pointes and sustained ventricular tachycardia increases her risk of developing other cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.
5. Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA): The patient's history of CVA and atrial fibrillation increases her risk of developing a stroke or TIA.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue if not properly managed, which can lead to respiratory arrest and death.
7. Sepsis: The patient's prolonged hospital stay and use of invasive lines and devices increase her risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve her outcomes."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Doing much better.  No further TdP.  WEnt back into an atrial
   arrhythmia.  Afib--> atrial tachycardia.  Slightly volume o/l, diuresed
   with improvement in oxygenation.  Slightly nauseous today, o/w feels
   well.
   Physical Examination
   Bibasilar crackles
   Regular tachycardia
   MR murmur
   No edema
   Medical Decision Making
   - Breast biopsy in the next 24 hours
   - Eventual inpatient coronary angiography unless has BrCA with poor
   prognosis
   - titrate beta blockers up as tolerated for AT
   - diurese gently, as BP allows
    -eventual plans for MVR+/-CABG+AF surgery
   CCU care required [**Doctor Last Name **] to hemodynamic instability and recent malignant
   tachyarrhythmia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Doing much better.  No further TdP.  WEnt back into an atrial
   arrhythmia.  Afib--> atrial tachycardia.  Slightly volume o/l, diuresed
   with improvement in oxygenation.  Slightly nauseous today, o/w feels
   well.

   Assessment and Plan
   76-year-old woman with history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   and CVA on warfarin was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes
   after disopyramide initiation and now s/p cardiac arrest in the setting
   of sustained VT.
   s/p Code Blue and Intubation
   Patient had episode of torsades that degenerated into VT last night and
   now stable on levophed and isoproterenol.
   - continue isoproterenol to target HR > 80 and carvedilol to increase
   membrane stability and decrease PVCs
   - wean levophed
   - obtain repeat ECG
   - will need to pull femoral line and place right IJ or subclavian line
   - wean sedation and extubate as soon as possible after right IJ line
   placement
   Torsades
   Patient started on disopyramide on saturday, and torsades is a known
   complication of this medication. Last dose of disopyramide was on [**2-6**]
   AM. Half life of disopyramide is 4-8 hours; so would expect
   disopyramide to be metabolized and at minimal concentrations within 24
   hours of last dose. Patient now back in sinus.
   - daily ECGs
   - continue magnesium q4h
   - continue to hold disopyramide
   - if torsades continues, recommend magnesium push, consideration of
   lidocaine
   - monitor on telemetry
   - appreciate EP recs
   Atrial fibrillation:
   New onset, with rapid ventricular rate, and patient now in sinus. Has
   been asymptomatic.
   - telemetry
   - continue carvedilol
   - heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR
   - hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.
   - IV metoprolol or diltiazem as needed for rapid rates
   [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward secondary to afib
   with RVR.
   - hold losartan and triamterene-HCTZ
   - control RVR as above
   - trend renal labs
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   Rheumatic Heart disease:
   This was diagnosed on this admission via ECHO. patient needs MV
   replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. They will do this
   pending preop work up, including breast biopsy and cardiac
   catherization
   - Cardiac Surgery is following
   - heparin for now
   - will clarify if surgery will be inpatient this admission or as
   outpatient.
   Breast Mass: as seen on recent mammogram
   - patient on heparin gtt here, will try to get breast biopsy as
   inpatient. This was planned for [**2-7**] but will be delayed in the acute
   setting.
   - will call breast imaging to rearrange this after clarifyig that that
   is should be delayed.
   H/o CVA: holding home warfarin, on heparin gtt for now
   - will restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and afib
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - insulin s.s.
   HTN: Patient has a history of hypertension, although currently on
   levophed after the cardiac arrest.
   - holding anti-hypertensives
   - will restart anti-hypertensives as needed
   - wean levophed
   Fluid overload: Likely secondary to MVR. got lasix earlier this
   admission. No history of CHF, EF >55% on ECHO
   - lasix as needed
   - consider repeat echo

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   76-year-old woman with history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
   and CVA on warfarin was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes
   after disopyramide initiation and now s/p cardiac arrest in the setting
   of sustained VT.
   s/p Code Blue and Intubation
   Patient had episode of torsades that degenerated into VT last night and
   now stable on levophed and isoproterenol.
   - continue isoproterenol to target HR > 80 and carvedilol to increase
   membrane stability and decrease PVCs
   - wean levophed
   - obtain repeat ECG
   - will need to pull femoral line and place right IJ or subclavian line
   - wean sedation and extubate as soon as possible after right IJ line
   placement
   Torsades
   Patient started on disopyramide on saturday, and torsades is a known
   complication of this medication. Last dose of disopyramide was on [**2-6**]
   AM. Half life of disopyramide is 4-8 hours; so would expect
   disopyramide to be metabolized and at minimal concentrations within 24
   hours of last dose. Patient now back in sinus.
   - daily ECGs
   - continue magnesium q4h
   - continue to hold disopyramide
   - if torsades continues, recommend magnesium push, consideration of
   lidocaine
   - monitor on telemetry
   - appreciate EP recs
   Atrial fibrillation:
   New onset, with rapid ventricular rate, and patient now in sinus. Has
   been asymptomatic.
   - telemetry
   - continue carvedilol
   - heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR
   - hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.
   - IV metoprolol or diltiazem as needed for rapid rates
   [**Last Name (un) 2406**]
   Cr 1.5 from baseline of 1.1. Likely to poor forward secondary to afib
   with RVR.
   - hold losartan and triamterene-HCTZ
   - control RVR as above
   - trend renal labs
   - renally dose meds as appropriate
   .
   Rheumatic Heart disease:
   This was diagnosed on this admission via ECHO. patient needs MV
   replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. They will do this
   pending preop work up, including breast biopsy and cardiac
   catherization
   - Cardiac Surgery is following
   - heparin for now
   - will clarify if surgery will be inpatient this admission or as
   outpatient.
   Breast Mass: as seen on recent mammogram
   - patient on heparin gtt here, will try to get breast biopsy as
   inpatient. This was planned for [**2-7**] but will be delayed in the acute
   setting.
   - will call breast imaging to rearrange this after clarifyig that that
   is should be delayed.
   H/o CVA: holding home warfarin, on heparin gtt for now
   - will restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and afib
   Diabetes Mellitus Type 2:
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   - insulin s.s.
   HTN: Patient has a history of hypertension, although currently on
   levophed after the cardiac arrest.
   - holding anti-hypertensives
   - will restart anti-hypertensives as needed
   - wean levophed
   Fluid overload: Likely secondary to MVR. got lasix earlier this
   admission. No history of CHF, EF >55% on ECHO
   - lasix as needed
   - consider repeat echo

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CVA on warfarin, admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes after disopyramide initiation and now s/p cardiac arrest in the setting of sustained VT.

The patient had an episode of torsades that degenerated into VT last night and is currently stable on levophed and isoproterenol. The plan is to continue isoproterenol to target HR > 80, wean levophed, obtain repeat ECG, and place a right IJ or subclavian line.

The patient was started on disopyramide on Saturday, and torsades is a known complication of this medication. The last dose of disopyramide was on [**2-6**] AM, and the half-life of disopyramide is 4-8 hours, so it is expected to be metabolized and at minimal concentrations within 24 hours of the last dose.

The patient now has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate and has been asymptomatic. The plan is to continue telemetry, carvedilol, and heparin gtt pending breast biopsy and plan for cath and MVR. The patient will hold coumadin until all procedures are organized or done.

The patient has a history of rheumatic heart disease, diagnosed on this admission via ECHO, and needs MV replacement and tricuspid repair per CT surgery. The patient will be followed by Cardiac Surgery and will be on heparin for now.

The patient has a breast mass as seen on recent mammogram and will try to get breast biopsy as inpatient. The patient is holding home warfarin and will restart warfarin on discharge for both CVA and afib.

The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and will hold oral hypoglycemics and insulin s.s. The patient has a history of hypertension and is currently on levophed after the cardiac arrest. The plan is to hold anti-hypertensives, restart anti-hypertensives as needed, and wean levophed.

The patient has fluid overload likely secondary to MVR and has received lasix earlier this admission. No history of CHF, EF >55% on ECHO. The plan is to use lasix as needed and consider repeat echo.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate, and torsades de pointes.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient has had a recent cardiac arrest and is at risk for another one.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and has a history of respiratory failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient has a history of hypertension and is at risk for renal failure.
5. Fluid overload: The patient has fluid overload likely secondary to MVR and is at risk for further fluid overload.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly VAP and DVT.
7. Bleeding: The patient is on heparin and warfarin and is at risk for bleeding.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and is at risk for hypoglycemia.
9. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension and is at risk for further hypertension.
10. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of rheumatic heart disease and is at risk for further cardiovascular complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a [insert patient's age] year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities, including mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, and acute renal failure. The patient has been experiencing increased ectopy, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and sustained ventricular tachycardia (SVT) around noon, which was treated with metoprolol. The patient was weaned off levophed and is currently on isoproterenol. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 116 beats per minute, blood pressure of 102/64 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and is being monitored for respiratory and cardiac status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia increases the risk of cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
2. Renal Complications: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed promptly and effectively.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if the mechanical ventilation is not properly managed, leading to respiratory failure and potential need for intubation.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system increases the risk of infection, particularly sepsis, which can exacerbate the patient's underlying conditions.
5. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulant therapy increases the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial bleeding.
6. Metabolic Complications: The patient's diabetes and acute kidney injury may lead to metabolic complications, including hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient's compromised nutritional status may lead to malnutrition, which can exacerbate the patient's underlying conditions.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac and respiratory status closely.
2. Adjust the patient's medication regimen as needed to manage cardiac arrhythmias and blood pressure.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust the fluid and electrolyte management accordingly.
4. Continue to provide mechanical ventilation and adjust the settings as needed to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
5. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and provide adequate nutrition to prevent malnutrition.
6. Monitor the patient's metabolic status and adjust the medication regimen as needed to prevent metabolic complications.
7. Consider consultation with a cardiologist and nephrologist to optimize the patient's care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CVA on warfarin. She was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes after disopyramide initiation and had a cardiac arrest in the setting of sustained VT. She was intubated and extubated later.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.6°C, HR 125 bpm, BP 109/58 mmHg, RR 19 inspirations per minute, SpO2 98%.
* Heart rhythm: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) with rapid heart rate.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has been receiving heparin sodium infusion at a rate of 800 units per hour.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,020 mL of fluids, with a negative balance of -1,294 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen delivery via nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 98%.
* Physical examination: The patient is alert and in no acute distress (NAD). Her HEENT, neck, and cardiac exams are normal. She has crackles at the bases of her lungs and a distended abdomen.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 15.0, 12.7, 11.4
* Hct: 37.6, 35.5, 40.4
* Plt: 429, 308, 317
* Cr: 1.5, 1.3, 1.3, 1.4
* TropT: 0.02
* TCO2: 21, 21, 20, 22
* Glucose: 106, 246, 0, 119

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Avoiding QT prolonging agents
* Daily EKGs
* Continuing close monitoring with telemetry and hospital pads
* Keeping magnesium levels high normal
* Uptitrating metoprolol as tolerated
* Considering digoxin if HR remains high
* Holding anticoagulation for anticipation of procedures
* Possible pulmonary isolation and maze during surgery

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Torsades de pointes due to disopyramide washout
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid heart rate
* Fluid overload secondary to MVR
* Hypotension due to vasopressor washout
* Hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy
* Respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema
* Cardiac arrest due to arrhythmias or hypotension

Based on the patient's current condition and plan of care, it is essential to continue close monitoring and adjust treatment as needed to prevent these potential complications and ensure the patient's optimal recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CVA on warfarin, who was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes after disopyramide initiation and now s/p cardiac arrest in the setting of sustained VT. She has developed atrial fibrillation, and her heart rate is high, with marginal blood pressure. She has a dilated left atrium, and the presence of CHF and AFib warrants valve repair. She is also scheduled for a breast biopsy today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient has already experienced cardiac arrest and is at risk for further episodes due to her sustained VT and atrial fibrillation.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has CHF and AFib, which may worsen her condition and lead to further complications.
3. Valve Repair: The patient is scheduled for valve repair surgery, which carries risks such as bleeding, infection, and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Breast Biopsy Complications: The patient is scheduled for a breast biopsy, which may be complicated by bleeding, infection, or other surgical risks.
5. Blood Clot Formation: The patient is at risk for blood clot formation due to her warfarin therapy and her prolonged hospitalization.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her indwelling lines and tubes, and her prolonged hospitalization.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's diabetes is not well-controlled, and she may be at risk for hypoglycemia, particularly if her insulin therapy is not adjusted properly.
8. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may be at risk for further pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Feels better.  Nausea is gone, post-CPR ribcage pain also better.  No
   dyspnea or precordial pain.
   Physical Examination
   JVP flat
   irregular tachycardia, (+)faint MR murmur
   lungs clear
   abdomen nontender
   no pedal edema
   Medical Decision Making
   - breast biopsy today
   - start digoxin for HR control, give small doses of IV diltiazem, as BP
   tolerates
   - tentatively plan for coronary angiography on Monday
   - surgery later next week, or (if hemodynamics stabilize) - as
   outpatient in the very near future
   - resume IV heparin following biopsy
   - no warfarin for now given upcoming procedures

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Feels better.  Nausea is gone, post-CPR ribcage pain also better.  No
   dyspnea or precordial pain.
   Physical Examination
   JVP flat
   irregular tachycardia, (+)faint MR murmur
   lungs clear
   abdomen nontender
   no pedal edema
   Medical Decision Making
   - breast biopsy today
   - start digoxin for HR control, give small doses of IV diltiazem, as BP
   tolerates
   - tentatively plan for coronary angiography on Monday
   - surgery later next week, or (if hemodynamics stabilize) - as
   outpatient in the very near future
   - resume IV heparin following biopsy
   - no warfarin for now given upcoming procedures

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CVA on warfarin. She was admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes after disopyramide initiation and subsequently had a cardiac arrest in the setting of sustained VT. She was resuscitated and is now in the ICU with atrial fibrillation, high heart rates, and marginal blood pressure. She has a history of rheumatic heart disease with 3+MR and is awaiting valve repair surgery. She is also scheduled for a breast biopsy today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: Given the patient's history of torsade de pointes and cardiac arrest, there is a risk of further cardiac arrests if not managed properly.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to further complications such as stroke, heart failure, and decreased cardiac output.
3. High Heart Rates: The patient's high heart rates may lead to decreased cardiac output, decreased blood pressure, and increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Marginal Blood Pressure: The patient's marginal blood pressure may lead to decreased perfusion of vital organs, such as the brain, kidneys, and liver.
5. Valve Repair Surgery: The patient's rheumatic heart disease with 3+MR may lead to further complications during valve repair surgery, such as cardiac arrest, stroke, and bleeding.
6. Breast Biopsy: The patient's breast biopsy may lead to complications such as bleeding, infection, and hematoma.
7. Anticoagulation: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may lead to bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, urinary tract bleeding, and intracranial bleeding.
8. Insulin Resistance: The patient's history of T2DM and insulin resistance may lead to further complications, such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, and increased risk of cardiovascular disease."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CVA on warfarin, admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes after disopyramide initiation and subsequent cardiac arrest in the setting of sustained VT. She is currently extubated and has atrial fibrillation that is not rate-controlled. She has a history of rheumatic heart disease with 3+MR and is anticipated to undergo CT surgery. She also has breast calcifications and is scheduled for a breast biopsy.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not rate-controlled, which increases the risk of stroke and heart failure.
2. Heart failure: The patient has a history of CHF and is at risk of worsening heart failure due to her atrial fibrillation and MR.
3. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk of developing thromboembolic events, such as DVT and pulmonary embolism, due to her immobility and atrial fibrillation.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, such as VAP, due to her prolonged hospitalization and mechanical ventilation.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding due to her anticoagulation therapy and history of CHF.
6. Metabolic complications: The patient is at risk of developing metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, due to her diabetes and insulin therapy.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient is at risk of developing respiratory complications, such as pneumonia and respiratory failure, due to her prolonged mechanical ventilation and underlying lung disease.
8. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, such as torsade de pointes, due to her underlying cardiac disease and medication therapy.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a [age] year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, and acute renal failure. She underwent a breast biopsy and was started on diltiazem for rate control. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 110 bpm and blood pressure of 101/58 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 99%. Her labs show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and creatinine levels, with a normal glucose level.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient's heart rhythm is AFIB, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and increased risk of stroke. Close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is necessary to prevent complications.
3. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient's ECG shows VT, which can lead to cardiac arrest. Close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is necessary to prevent complications.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's SpO2 is 99%, indicating potential respiratory compromise. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygen therapy is necessary to prevent complications.
5. Infection: The patient's WBC count is elevated, indicating potential infection. Close monitoring of temperature, white blood cell count, and other lab values is necessary to detect and treat any potential infections.
6. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is elevated, indicating potential bleeding risk. Close monitoring of platelet count and coagulation studies is necessary to detect and treat any potential bleeding complications.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's nutrition status is not well-documented, indicating potential malnutrition risk. Close monitoring of nutrition intake and lab values is necessary to detect and treat any potential malnutrition complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old post-operative patient in the ICU, recovering from a breast biopsy. She is an elderly woman with a history of mitral regurgitation, atrial fibrillation, and breast mass. She has developed acute renal failure, ventricular tachycardia, and is receiving heparin sodium infusion for anticoagulation. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 101/58 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is receiving respiratory support with nasal cannula and is on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's chronic atrial fibrillation and acute respiratory failure, there is a risk of respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which could compromise cardiac output and increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of infection.
4. Sepsis: The patient's acute renal failure and respiratory failure may increase the risk of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy with heparin sodium may increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as hematomas or bleeding into the lungs.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of indwelling catheters and lines may increase the risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's poor nutritional status and potential for malnutrition may increase the risk of complications, such as wound healing delays, and increase the risk of mortality."

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CVA on warfarin, admitted to the CCU with torsade de pointes after disopyramide initiation and subsequent cardiac arrest. She has atrial fibrillation, high heart rates, and marginal blood pressure. She also has rheumatic heart disease with 3+MR, dilated left atrium, and CHF. She underwent a breast biopsy and is awaiting CT surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Torsades de pointes: Prolonged QT interval can lead to cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, or torsades de pointes.
	* Atrial fibrillation: High heart rates and marginal blood pressure can lead to cardiac failure, stroke, or thromboembolism.
	* Rheumatic heart disease: Valve repair or replacement surgery may be necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pulmonary edema: High blood pressure and CHF can lead to pulmonary edema.
	* Pneumonia: Presence of lung crackles and possible aspiration during surgery can increase the risk of pneumonia.
3. Neurological Complications:
	* Stroke: Previous CVA and atrial fibrillation increase the risk of stroke.
	* Seizures: Presence of electrolyte imbalance and cardiac arrhythmias can increase the risk of seizures.
4. Infection Complications:
	* Sepsis: Presence of indwelling lines and catheters can increase the risk of sepsis.
	* VAP: Ventilator-associated pneumonia can occur due to prolonged ventilation.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding: Presence of anticoagulation and CHF can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
	* Stress ulcer: Presence of stress and anticoagulation can increase the risk of stress ulcer.
6. Endocrine Complications:
	* Hypoglycemia: Presence of insulin and oral hypoglycemics can increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
	* Hyperglycemia: Presence of diabetes and insulin can increase the risk of hyperglycemia.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA) on warfarin. She was admitted to the ICU with torsade de pointes after initiation of disopyramide and had a cardiac arrest in the setting of sustained VT.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.7°C, heart rate 110 bpm, blood pressure 101/58 mmHg, respiratory rate 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% on nasal cannula.
* Cardiac rhythm: Atrial fibrillation (AF) with rate control.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) 8 cm, mean arterial pressure (MAP) 68 mmHg, and cardiac index (CI) 2.5 L/min/m².
* Fluid balance: Total fluid input 1,046 mL, total fluid output 750 mL, and net fluid balance -296 mL.
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen therapy.
* Labs: White blood cell count 15.0 K/μL, hemoglobin 13.0 g/dL, platelet count 429 K/μL, creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, and troponin-T 0.02 ng/mL.
* Imaging: Chest X-ray shows no acute changes.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of renal function: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is at risk of further decline in renal function.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she may be at risk of developing respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of torsade de pointes and is currently in AF, which may increase her risk of developing other cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase her risk of bleeding complications.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly in the setting of prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines and devices.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and she may be at risk of developing deficiencies, particularly in the setting of prolonged ICU stay.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing pressure ulcers, particularly in the setting of prolonged immobility.
8. Delirium: The patient's mental status is altered, and she may be at risk of developing delirium, particularly in the setting of prolonged ICU stay and medication use.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the following plan should be considered:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's cardiac rhythm and hemodynamic status.
2. Optimize the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of T2DM, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and CVA on warfarin. She was admitted to the ICU with torsade de pointes after disopyramide initiation and had a cardiac arrest in the setting of sustained VT. She has atrial fibrillation, which is being rate-controlled with diltiazem. She has a history of rheumatic heart disease with 3+MR and a dilated left atrium, which warrants valve repair. She also has torsades/polymorphic VT, which has been resolved with disopyrimide washing out.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98°F)
* Heart rate: 110 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 101/58 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 99%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 13.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 317 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 15.0
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.02
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.6 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.7 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.9 mg/dL

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continuing diltiazem 60mg QID to control heart rate
* Giving a 250mL NS bolus this morning
* Holding off on starting coumadin since procedures are pending
* Considering starting amiodarone
* Anticipating CT surgery and cardiac catheterization on Monday
* Monitoring for rib fractures and managing pain with tylenol prn
* Following up on breast biopsy pathology
* Monitoring for torsades/polymorphic VT and avoiding QT prolonging agents
* Keeping magnesium levels high normal
* Managing diabetes with insulin s.s.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as torsades/polymorphic VT, due to the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and rheumatic heart disease
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's respiratory rate of 21 bpm and possible pulmonary edema
* Renal failure due to the patient's creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL and possible hypotension
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's history of anticoagulation therapy and possible gastrointestinal ulcers
* Infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state and possible catheter-related infections
* Thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis, due to the patient's history of CVA and anticoagulation therapy."
