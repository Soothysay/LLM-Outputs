 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), PANCREAS
   79 year-old male with a history of DM, pancreatic cancer s/p
   chemoradiation complicated by recent ascending cholangitis and
   malnutrition on TPN, who presents with weakness and abdominal pain,
   found to have multiple/bilateral PEs and also hematemesis in the ED
   # Hypotension/Shock: possible etiologies include obstructive from his
   submassive PEs; septic, from possibly a GI (SBP or gastroenteritis)
   source; vs hypovolemic from bleeding.
   - volume resuscitated with 7L NS + 2 units PRBCs in the ED
   - consider placing IJ for CVP monitoring
   - levophed rather than dopamine (due to tachycardia) to keep MAP >= 65
   - trend lactate
   # Hematemesis: possible causes include AVM, gastritis, PUD, erosion of
   metastatic disease, or portal hypertension from portal v thrombosis
   leading to varices. Gen surgery reviewed his CT scans with radiology
   and did not see any compelling signs of vascular invasion or varices
   that would explain his massive hematemesis, although CT has low
   sensitivity for this diagnosis.
   - two large bore PIVs
   - active type and crossmatch 4 units; serial Hct
   - pantoprazole 40mg IV BID
   - GI planning scope in am if stable, otherwise, would need angio for
   localization/hemostasis if rebleeds
   # Bilateral PE: The patient was found on chest CT to have b/l PE. This
   was likely secondary to his procoagulant state secondary to pancreatic
   cancer (Trousseau's syndrome). Anticoagulation is contraindicated [**1-2**]
   massive hematemesis.
   # Pancreatic cancer:  The patient completed a course of chemoradiation
   with 5-FU and EBRT on [**11-11**] which included 5 endoscopic US-guided
   intratumoral injections of TNFerade. Given his issues with malnutrition
   and poor functional status further chemo has been deferred.
   - Will speak with his outpatient oncologist in the am.
   # Malnutrition:  The patient was recently started on TPN as dysphagia
   has been a significant problem for him.  His dysphagic is thought to be
   due to malnutrition-related oropharyngeal myopahty.
   - TPN on hold [**1-2**] no access
   - Nutrition consult.
   - Decadron 4 mg [**Hospital1 **] to decrease nausea as well as compazine.
   # Anasarca: The patient is on aldactone and lasix for anasarca that is
   thought to be related to malnutrition. Hold diuretics for now.
   # Diabetes: The patient is on glipizide as an outpatient.  In the ED
   his serum glucose was 363 and he had glucose in his urine, although no
   ketones.
   - Will hold glipizide for now.
   - Monitor sugars with qid fingersticks and cover with SSI.
   # Hyponatremia: Na of 130 on initial labs in the ED; up to 135 after
   volume resuscitation, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia [**1-2**] diuretic use
   at home. Continue to monitor sodium.
   # Depression: Continue remeron.
   # Sacral dcubitus ulcuer: The patient has a known decubitus ulcer and
   received VNA-wound care services at home.
   - Will obtain a wound consult.
   # FEN:  TPN and nutrition consult as above
   # Access: Port-a-cath, 2 18g PIVs
   # PPx: pneumoboots (no heparin [**1-2**] bleeding), bowel regimen, ppi as
   above
   # Code: DNR/DNI if he should actually suffer a cardiac or respiratory
   arrest, but full supportive measures including pressors, transfusions,
   and invasive monitoring lines otherwise

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type I diabetes, pancreatic cancer, and recent ascending cholangitis. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including:

1. Hypotension (not in shock): possible causes include obstructive from submassive PEs, septic from a GI source, or hypovolemic from bleeding.
2. Hematemesis: possible causes include AVM, gastritis, PUD, erosion of metastatic disease, or portal hypertension from portal vein thrombosis leading to varices.
3. Bilateral Pulmonary Embolism (PE): likely secondary to his procoagulant state secondary to pancreatic cancer (Trousseau's syndrome).
4. Malnutrition: related to dysphagia and oropharyngeal myopathy.
5. Anasarca: related to malnutrition and currently being treated with aldactone and lasix.
6. Diabetes: currently on glipizide, but will be held for now.
7. Hyponatremia: likely hypovolemic hyponatremia due to diuretic use at home.
8. Depression: currently on remeron.
9. Sacral decubitus ulcer: has a known decubitus ulcer and received VNA-wound care services at home.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

* Ongoing pain control with morphine sulfate
* Ongoing fluid resuscitation with NS and PRBCs
* Ongoing anticoagulation with norepinephrine
* Ongoing management of his diabetes with SSI and fingerstick glucose monitoring
* Ongoing monitoring of his sodium levels
* Ongoing wound care for his sacral decubitus ulcer

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued bleeding from the GI tract
* Further deterioration of his hypotension and possible development of shock
* Progression of his PEs and possible development of respiratory failure
* Further deterioration of his malnutrition and anasarca
* Development of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to his diabetes
* Development of hypernatremia or hyponatremia due to his hyponatremia
* Worsening of his depression
* Development of further complications related to his sacral decubitus ulcer

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his multiple medical conditions to prevent further complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type 1 diabetes, pancreatic cancer, and recent ascending cholangitis. He is currently admitted to the ICU for management of multiple bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs), hematemesis, and vasopressor support.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 91 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 105/52 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 16 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin build, with pale conjunctiva and mild periumbilical tenderness. His abdomen is distended, and his extremities show mild edema. He is oriented to person, place, and time, and his neurologic examination is normal.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 16.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 280 x 10^9/L. His liver function tests are mildly elevated, and his blood glucose is 259 mg/dL. He has a lactic acid level of 3.4 mmol/L and an albumin level of 2.2 g/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include diabetes mellitus, type 1; pain control; hypotension; pulmonary embolism; and pancreatic cancer. His medications include norepinephrine, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of ascending cholangitis and recent hematemesis, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary embolism and hypotension increase the risk of developing respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's hypotension and vasopressor support increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of hematemesis and abdominal pain increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's indwelling lines and port-a-cath increase the risk of developing infections.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and lack of oral intake increase the risk of developing nutritional deficiencies.
7. Organ failure: The patient's pancreatic cancer and hypotension increase the risk of developing organ failure, particularly renal and hepatic failure.

In summary, the patient is a complex case requiring close monitoring and management of his multiple medical conditions."

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a diagnosis of end-stage pancreatic cancer. They are receiving comfort measures only, with morphine as needed for pain control. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 90-109 bpm, blood pressure of 92/51-140/73 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's respiratory support consists of nasal cannula oxygen delivery, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.18.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds, and trace peripheral edema. The patient's neurologic examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 16.2-17.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 31.6-31.7 g/dL, platelet count of 280-343 K/uL, and creatinine of 0.7-0.8 mg/dL. Other laboratory results include elevated liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, and calcium levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Comfort measures only, with morphine as needed for pain control
* Palliation for abdominal pain and ascites
* ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and lines management
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's underlying pancreatic cancer and ascites
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying disease and potential complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure
* Cardiovascular complications, such as hypotension or cardiac arrhythmias, due to the patient's underlying disease and potential complications such as sepsis or cardiac failure
* Infections, such as sepsis or pneumonia, due to the patient's underlying disease and potential complications
* Metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia or electrolyte imbalances, due to the patient's underlying disease and potential complications.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their care plan as needed to prevent and manage potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old end-stage pancreatic cancer patient who has been admitted to the ICU for comfort measures only. The patient's condition remains stable, with controlled pain and asymptomatic hypotension overnight. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 92/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleed and continued use of heparin may increase the risk of further bleeding.
2. Hypotension: The patient's asymptomatic hypotension may indicate a potential issue with blood pressure regulation.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation of 96% may indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia may indicate an underlying infection.
5. Pancreatitis: The patient's history of pancreatic cancer and ascites may increase the risk of pancreatitis.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's lack of nutrition may lead to malnutrition and further compromise the patient's condition.
7. DVT: The patient's history of pancreatic cancer and immobility may increase the risk of DVT.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's use of corticosteroids and history of GI bleed may increase the risk of stress ulcer.
9. VAP: The patient's use of mechanical ventilation and history of GI bleed may increase the risk of VAP.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Consider adjusting the patient's medication regimen to manage pain and hypotension.
3. Continue to provide nutritional support to the patient.
4. Consider ordering further imaging studies to evaluate the patient's pancreatic cancer and potential complications.
5. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of infection and take appropriate measures to prevent and treat infections.
6. Consider ordering further laboratory tests to evaluate the patient's liver and kidney function.
7. Continue to provide palliative care to the patient and family.
8. Consider referring the patient to a palliative care specialist.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's code status and make adjustments as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of DM, pancreatic cancer s/p
   chemoradiation complicated by recent ascending cholangitis and
   malnutrition on TPN, who presents with weakness and abdominal pain,
   found to have multiple/bilateral PEs and also hematemesis in the ED
   # Pancreatic cancer:  The patient completed a course of chemoradiation
   with 5-FU and EBRT on [**11-11**] which included 5 endoscopic US-guided
   intratumoral injections of TNFerade. Given his issues with malnutrition
   and poor functional status further chemo has been deferred.  After
   discussion with the patient and his family, he has chosen to be made
   CMO.
   - Zofran and prochlorperazine prn for nausea
   - Morphine prn for pain or SOB
   - Trazadone prn for insomnia.
   # Hypotension/Shock: possible etiologies include obstructive from his
   submassive PEs; septic, from possibly a GI (SBP or gastroenteritis)
   source; vs hypovolemic from bleeding. He was volume resuscitated with
   7L NS + 2 units PRBCs in the ED.  He was initially placed on levophed,
   however this was weaned off yesterday when he was made CMO.  His SBPs
   have been stable since this was weaned.
   # Hematemesis: No further evidence of bleeding.  Labs dc
ed given his
   CMO status.  Will continue to monitor.
   # Bilateral PE: The patient was found on chest CT to have b/l PE. This
   was likely secondary to his procoagulant state secondary to pancreatic
   cancer (Trousseau's syndrome). Anticoagulation is contraindicated [**1-2**]
   massive hematemesis.
   # Diabetes: As the patient is CMO, insulin has been DC
ed and no
   fingersticks are being checked.
   # Depression: Continue remeron.
   # Sacral dcubitus ulcuer: The patient has a known decubitus ulcer and
   received VNA-wound care services at home.
   - Wound consult with supportive care.
   # FEN:  sips, as he is CMO, if he requests food he can eat as tolerated
   # Access: Port-a-cath, 2 18g [**Last Name (LF) 5258**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] pull his A-line today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes, pancreatic cancer, and malnutrition. He was admitted to the ICU with weakness, abdominal pain, and bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs) with hematemesis. He has been made Comfort Measures Only (CMO) and has chosen to discontinue all life-sustaining treatments.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
* Heart rate: 101 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 104/51 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Sinus tachycardia

Laboratory results:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 16.2, Hct 31.7, Plt 280
* Renal function: Cr 0.8, Glucose 259
* Liver function: ALT 46, AST 35, Alk Phos 190, T Bili 1.2
* Coagulation studies: PT 15.5, PTT 31.8, INR 1.3
* Electrolytes: Na 136, K 4.0, Ca 8.0, Mg 1.5, PO4 3.2
* Lactic acid: 3.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.2 g/dL
* LDH: 166 IU/L

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's blood pressure is 104/51 mmHg, which may indicate hypotension. Possible etiologies include obstructive shock from submassive PEs, septic shock from a gastrointestinal source, or hypovolemic shock from bleeding.
2. Bilateral Pulmonary Emboli (PEs): The patient has bilateral PEs, which may lead to respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Malnutrition: The patient has a history of malnutrition and is receiving Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN). Malnutrition may exacerbate his underlying medical conditions and increase the risk of complications.
4. Pancreatic Cancer: The patient has a history of pancreatic cancer, which may lead to complications such as pancreatic insufficiency, malnutrition, and potentially life-threatening bleeding.
5. Sacral Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a known sacral decubitus ulcer, which may become infected and lead to systemic complications.
6. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is receiving remeron. Depression may worsen his overall condition and increase the risk of complications.
7. Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's fluid and electrolyte balance may be compromised due to his underlying medical conditions and treatments. This may lead to life-threatening complications if not managed properly.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and medical condition closely. Further treatment decisions should be made in consultation with the patient and his family, taking into account his CMO status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes, pancreatic cancer, and recent ascending cholangitis and malnutrition on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). He presents with weakness, abdominal pain, and bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs), as well as hematemesis. The patient has been made Comfort Measures Only (CMO) and has chosen to discontinue further chemotherapy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure of 104/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. His physical examination reveals bilateral pitting edema, muscle wasting, and distended abdomen.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Other labs are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's hypotension may be due to obstructive PE, septic shock, or hypovolemic shock from bleeding. Close monitoring of his blood pressure and volume status is essential.
2. Hematemesis: Although the patient has stopped bleeding, continued monitoring is necessary to detect any further bleeding episodes.
3. Bilateral PE: The patient's PEs are likely secondary to his procoagulant state due to pancreatic cancer. Anticoagulation is contraindicated due to the risk of massive hematemesis.
4. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a known decubitus ulcer, and wound care services are necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may exacerbate his underlying medical conditions and increase the risk of complications.
6. Depression: The patient's depression may require ongoing management and support.
7. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to his PEs and immobility. Prophylactic measures should be considered to prevent DVT.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings.
2. Maintain the patient's comfort and manage his pain, nausea, and insomnia as needed.
3. Continue wound care services for the sacral decubitus ulcer.
4. Consider prophylactic measures to prevent DVT.
5. Review the patient's code status and ensure that all healthcare providers are aware of his DNR/DNI and CMO status.
6. Discharge planning should include arrangements for continued wound care services and support for the patient's depression."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of DM, pancreatic cancer s/p
   chemoradiation complicated by recent ascending cholangitis and
   malnutrition on TPN, who presents with weakness and abdominal pain,
   found to have multiple/bilateral PEs and also hematemesis in the ED
   # Pancreatic cancer:  The patient completed a course of chemoradiation
   with 5-FU and EBRT on [**11-11**] which included 5 endoscopic US-guided
   intratumoral injections of TNFerade. Given his issues with malnutrition
   and poor functional status further chemo has been deferred.  After
   discussion with the patient and his family, he has chosen to be made
   CMO.
   - Zofran and prochlorperazine prn for nausea
   - Morphine prn for pain or SOB
   - Trazadone prn for insomnia.
   # Hypotension/Shock: possible etiologies include obstructive from his
   submassive PEs; septic, from possibly a GI (SBP or gastroenteritis)
   source; vs hypovolemic from bleeding. He was volume resuscitated with
   7L NS + 2 units PRBCs in the ED.  He was initally placed on levophed,
   however this was weaned off yesterday when he was made CMO.
   # Hematemesis: No further evidence of bleeding.  Labs dc
ed given his
   CMO status.  Will continue to monitor.
   # Bilateral PE: The patient was found on chest CT to have b/l PE. This
   was likely secondary to his procoagulant state secondary to pancreatic
   cancer (Trousseau's syndrome). Anticoagulation is contraindicated [**1-2**]
   massive hematemesis.
   # Diabetes: As the patient is CMO, insulin has been DC
ed and no
   fingersticks are being checked.
   # Depression: Continue remeron.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes, pancreatic cancer, and malnutrition, who presented with weakness, abdominal pain, and bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs). He had a course of chemoradiation with 5-FU and EBRT, but further chemo has been deferred due to malnutrition and poor functional status. He has chosen to be made Comfort Measures Only (CMO).

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
* Heart rate: 101 bpm (88-104)
* Blood pressure: 104/51 mmHg (69-124/62)
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (15-25)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 17.2 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 10.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 293 K/μL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 259 mg/dL
* Other lab results: PT/PTT/INR: 15.5/31.8/1.3, ALT/AST: 46/35, Alk Phos/T Bili: 190/1.2, etc.

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General appearance: Elderly man lying in bed in no acute distress
* Eyes/conjunctiva: PERRL, conjunctiva pale
* Cardiovascular: RRR, no MRG
* Respiratory/chest: CTAB
* Abdominal: +BS, distended, non-tender
* Extremities: 1+ pitting edema bilaterally
* Musculoskeletal: Muscle wasting
* Skin: Warm
* Neurologic: Alert and appropriate

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Obstructive shock from bilateral PEs
2. Septic shock from a possible GI source
3. Hypovolemic shock from bleeding
4. Worsening malnutrition and dehydration
5. Development of pressure ulcers due to immobility
6. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or other respiratory complications
7. Cardiac complications due to pre-existing cardiac conditions
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
9. Infection or sepsis from indwelling lines or devices
10. Poor wound healing due to malnutrition and immobility

Given the patient's CMO status, further medical interventions may be limited, and the focus will be on providing comfort and supportive care."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old male with a history of DM, pancreatic cancer s/p
   chemoradiation complicated by recent ascending cholangitis and
   malnutrition on TPN, who presents with weakness and abdominal pain,
   found to have multiple/bilateral PEs and also hematemesis in the ED
   # Hypotension/Shock: possible etiologies include obstructive from his
   submassive PEs; septic, from possibly a GI (SBP or gastroenteritis)
   source; vs hypovolemic from bleeding.
   - volume resuscitated with 7L NS + 2 units PRBCs in the ED
   - consider placing IJ for CVP monitoring
   - levophed rather than dopamine (due to tachycardia) to keep MAP >= 65
   - trend lactate
   # Hematemesis: possible causes include AVM, gastritis, PUD, erosion of
   metastatic disease, or portal hypertension from portal v thrombosis
   leading to varices. Gen surgery reviewed his CT scans with radiology
   and did not see any compelling signs of vascular invasion or varices
   that would explain his massive hematemesis, although CT has low
   sensitivity for this diagnosis.
   - two large bore PIVs
   - active type and crossmatch 4 units; serial Hct
   - pantoprazole 40mg IV BID
   - GI planning scope in am if stable, otherwise, would need angio for
   localization/hemostasis if rebleeds
   # Bilateral PE: The patient was found on chest CT to have b/l PE. This
   was likely secondary to his procoagulant state secondary to pancreatic
   cancer (Trousseau's syndrome). Anticoagulation is contraindicated [**1-2**]
   massive hematemesis.
   # Pancreatic cancer:  The patient completed a course of chemoradiation
   with 5-FU and EBRT on [**11-11**] which included 5 endoscopic US-guided
   intratumoral injections of TNFerade. Given his issues with malnutrition
   and poor functional status further chemo has been deferred.
   - Will speak with his outpatient oncologist in the am.
   # Malnutrition:  The patient was recently started on TPN as dysphagia
   has been a significant problem for him.  His dysphagic is thought to be
   due to malnutrition-related oropharyngeal myopahty.
   - TPN on hold [**1-2**] no access
   - Nutrition consult.
   - Decadron 4 mg [**Hospital1 **] to decrease nausea as well as compazine.
   # Anasarca: The patient is on aldactone and lasix for anasarca that is
   thought to be related to malnutrition. Hold diuretics for now.
   # Diabetes: The patient is on glipizide as an outpatient.  In the ED
   his serum glucose was 363 and he had glucose in his urine, although no
   ketones.
   - Will hold glipizide for now.
   - Monitor sugars with qid fingersticks and cover with SSI.
   # Hyponatremia: Na of 130 on initial labs in the ED; up to 135 after
   volume resuscitation, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia [**1-2**] diuretic use
   at home. Continue to monitor sodium.
   # Depression: Continue remeron.
   # Sacral dcubitus ulcuer: The patient has a known decubitus ulcer and
   received VNA-wound care services at home.
   - Will obtain a wound consult.
   # FEN:  TPN and nutrition consult as above
   # Access: Port-a-cath, 2 18g PIVs
   # PPx: pneumoboots (no heparin [**1-2**] bleeding), bowel regimen, ppi as
   above
   # Code: DNR/DNI if he should actually suffer a cardiac or respiratory

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of diabetes, pancreatic cancer, and malnutrition, who presents with weakness, abdominal pain, and hematemesis. He has multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs) and was found to have hematemesis in the emergency department (ED). The patient was volume-resuscitated with 7L normal saline and 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in the ED. He is currently being treated with levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg and pantoprazole to prevent further bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's hypotension could be due to obstructive shock from his submassive PEs, septic shock from a gastrointestinal (GI) source, or hypovolemic shock from bleeding.
2. Hematemesis: The patient's massive hematemesis could be due to an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), gastritis, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), erosion of metastatic disease, or portal hypertension from portal vein thrombosis leading to varices.
3. Bilateral PE: The patient's bilateral PE is likely secondary to his procoagulant state due to pancreatic cancer (Trousseau's syndrome). Anticoagulation is contraindicated due to massive hematemesis.
4. Pancreatic cancer: The patient's pancreatic cancer has progressed, and further chemotherapy has been deferred due to his poor functional status and malnutrition.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition is causing dysphagia, which is thought to be due to malnutrition-related oropharyngeal myopathy. TPN has been held due to no access, and a nutrition consult has been ordered.
6. Anasarca: The patient's anasarca is thought to be related to malnutrition and is being treated with aldactone and lasix. The diuretics have been held for now.
7. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes is being managed with glipizide, but it has been held for now due to his current condition.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is likely due to hypovolemic hyponatremia and is being monitored.
9. Depression: The patient is being treated for depression with remeron.
10. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a known decubitus ulcer and is receiving wound care services at home. A wound consult has been ordered.
11. FEN: The patient's FEN (feeding and enteral nutrition) is being managed with TPN and a nutrition consult has been ordered.

ICU Care Plan:

1. Nutrition: The patient's nutrition is being managed with TPN and a nutrition consult has been ordered.
2. Glycemic Control: The patient's glycemic control is being managed with insulin and frequent fingerstick glucose monitoring.
3. Lines: The patient has an indwelling port, two 18-gauge peripheral intravenous lines, and an arterial line.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
5. Code status: The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.
6. Disposition: The patient is being discharged to the ICU."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a diagnosis of end-stage pancreatic cancer, requesting comfort measures only. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 93 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 96/51 mmHg. The patient is receiving morphine for pain management and has a central venous catheter (PortaCath) and an arterial line in place.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.4 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 17.2 K/uL
* Platelet count: 293 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 108 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.5/31.8/1.3, ALT/AST: 46/35, Alk Phos/T Bili: 190/1.2, and others.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with no acute distress, clear breath sounds, and soft, non-tender abdomen.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: Given the patient's end-stage pancreatic cancer, respiratory failure is a potential complication.
2. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an underlying infection.
3. Bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleed, and the use of heparin may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is not well-documented, and malnutrition may worsen the patient's condition.
5. Pain management: The patient is receiving morphine for pain management, but the patient's pain may not be adequately controlled.
6. Infection: The patient's indwelling lines and catheters may increase the risk of infection.
7. DVT: The patient's immobility and underlying cancer may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's plan includes comfort measures only, palliation of abdominal pain, and transfer to the floor. The patient's code status is comfort measures only, and the family has been informed of this decision."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a diagnosis of end-stage pancreatic cancer, requesting comfort measures only. They have been experiencing nausea, which has been managed with Zofran. The patient has been receiving morphine as needed for pain control. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 96/51 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 95%. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 293 K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleed, which may worsen due to the use of heparin.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to the progression of their underlying disease.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of indwelling lines and catheters increase the risk of infection.
4. Hemorrhage: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is unstable, with a net loss of 302 mL over the past 24 hours.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia.
7. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential kidney dysfunction.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutrition is compromised, which may exacerbate their underlying disease.
9. Pressure ulcers: The patient's immobility and decreased sensation may increase the risk of pressure ulcers.
10. Psychological distress: The patient's end-stage disease and limited treatment options may cause significant psychological distress for the patient and their family."
