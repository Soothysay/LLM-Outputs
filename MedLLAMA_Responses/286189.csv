   Assessment and Plan
   1)LGIB: Patient presents with approximately 400cc of BRBPR at HD. Per
   her PMH, she has a history of GI bleeding but no additional information
   is know at this time. Differential for LGIB includes hemmoroids,
   diverticuliosis, angiodysplasia, colitis (infectious, ischemia, IBD,
   and neoplasm. No report of fevers, chills, or diarrhea to suggest an
   infectious colitis or IBD. Also, IBD would be unusual to present for
   the first time in a 71yo woman. She has no prior history of CAD to
   suggest ischemic colitis. Most likely diverticulitis vs. hemorrhoids.
   Per OMR, she has not had a colonoscopy here. Her baseline Hct is
   between 25-30 but her Hct on admission today of 35.5. Her INR and PTT
   are elevated today.  She is on Aspirin as an outpatient but is not on
   any anti-coagulation (in light of history of atrial fibrillation).
   - Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - 2 PIVs in place
   - GI consult; consider colonoscopy
   - Hold ASA
   - Active type and screen
   - Transfuse if Hct<25
   - If PTT remains significantly elevated, consider Protamine
   2)Hypotension:  Patient was noted to be hypotensive with SBPs in 80
   possibly lower at dialysis. Unclear how much fluid was removed at
   dialysis. She also had 400cc of BRBPR which may be accounting for her
   transient hypotension.  She received 1L NS in the ED and her BP quickly
   stabilized and remains at baseline. No fevers or chills to suggest an
   underlying infectious process.  Lactate was elevated to 3.9 but this
   was in the setting of renal failure.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Repeat lactate
   3)Respiratory: Patient has history of respiratory failure s/p
   tracheostomy and was successfully weaned in [**1-11**]. Patient was acutely
   hypoxic with O2 saturation between 50-70%. She was also noted to have
   increased secretions; she likely mucous plugged given acute
   desaturation. Her Upon transfer to the MICU, her respiratory status
   stabilized.  She is currently on 50% trachmask.  No evidence of a
   pneumonia on cxray.
   - Check ABG
   - Sputum cx
   - Continue albuterol and atrovent nebs
   4)Coagulopathy: Patient presents with elevated INR and PTT. She is not
   on any anti-coagulation or blood thinners as outpatient. These labs may
   have been draw via a line that was flushed with heparin. This may also
   be due to heparin SQ she has been receiving at home.
   - Repeat coags
   5)ESRD on HD: Patient underwent dialysis today but prematurely stopped
   in the setting of BRBPR. Her BP during this time dropped and remained
   below baseline upon transfer to the ED.
   - Consult renal to let her know that she is here
   - Follow daily electrolytes
   6)COPD:  Continue Atrovent and Albuterol
   7)Anemia: Baseline Hct between 25-30. Hct on admission was 35, which is
   slightly elevated from baseline.  She receives Epogen at HD.
   - Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - Trend daily Hct
   8)Hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient Levoxyl.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of recurrent episodes of bleeding from the rectum (BRB). She has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, but no additional information is known at this time. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with a blood pressure of 121/53 mmHg and a heart rate of 87 bpm. She is receiving oxygen therapy through a tracheal mask and has a SpO2 of 94%. Her lactate level has decreased from 3.9 to 1.9 mmol/L after a small fluid bolus. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with an elevated INR and PTT.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI bleeding: The patient's history of GI bleeding and the current episode of BRB suggest a high risk of continued bleeding, which may lead to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and PTT may indicate a bleeding disorder or the effect of heparin from a previous line or SQ injection. This may lead to bleeding complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension during dialysis and her current blood pressure of 121/53 mmHg suggest a risk of further hypotension, which may lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of respiratory failure and her current requirement for oxygen therapy suggest a risk of further respiratory decline, which may lead to respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated lactate level and her history of respiratory failure suggest a risk of infection, which may lead to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's slightly elevated hemoglobin level and her history of anemia suggest a risk of further anemia, which may lead to fatigue, weakness, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism and her current requirement for outpatient medication suggest a risk of hypothyroidism, which may lead to fatigue, weakness, and potentially life-threatening complications.

Based on these potential medical complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU to prevent further complications and ensure her safe and effective care."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female who is currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with several underlying medical conditions. The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, which has been managed with blood transfusions and medication.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 96.8°F (36°C), heart rate of 87 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 121/53 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on a tracheostomy mask.

The patient's laboratory results show a hematocrit of 31.6%, which is stable and above baseline. The patient's lactate level has decreased from 3.9 to 1.9 mmol/L, indicating improvement in tissue perfusion. The patient's coagulation profile is normal, with a prothrombin time (PT) of 13.3 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 32.3 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.1.

The patient's imaging studies show a left basal effusion with atelectasis in the left lower lobe, which is likely secondary to mucous plugging. The patient's microbiology results show growth of gram-negative rods in the sputum culture, which is likely a colonizer in a chronically vented patient.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue to monitor the patient's GI bleeding and adjust treatment as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's coagulation profile and adjust treatment as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's lactate level and adjust treatment as needed.
* Continue to provide oxygen therapy as needed.
* Continue to provide antibiotics as needed.
* Continue to provide pain management as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as needed.
* Continue to provide nutrition as needed.
* Continue to provide hydration as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued GI bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
* Development of coagulopathy, which can lead to bleeding and hemorrhage.
* Development of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
* Development of respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory arrest and death.
* Development of cardiac failure, which can lead to cardiogenic shock and death.
* Development of kidney failure, which can lead to acute kidney injury and death.
* Development of electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and death.
* Development of hypothyroidism, which can lead to decreased metabolic rate and death.

In conclusion, the patient is a 63-year-old female who is currently admitted to the ICU with several underlying medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, and the patient's laboratory results show improvement in tissue perfusion. The patient's plan of care includes continued monitoring of the patient's GI bleeding, coagulation profile, lactate level, and electrolyte levels, as well as provision of oxygen therapy, antibiotics, pain management, and nutrition as needed. Potential medical complications that can arise include continued GI bleeding, development of coagulopathy, sepsis, respiratory failure, cardiac failure, kidney failure, electrolyte imbalances, and hypothyroidism."

   Assessment and Plan
   # LGIB: Patient presents with approximately 400cc of BRBPR at HD.
   Continued to have BRBPR during the day shift, but no episodes this past
   evening with a stable hematocrit.
   -Will touch base with GI, can likely prep this PM if she stabilizes, if
   she actively bleeds throughout the day, will put her in for a bleeding
   scan with option of angio
   -Daily HCT
   -Holding home dose ASA
   -Has two peripheral IVs for access, with an active type and screen
   # Coagulopathy: Initially transiently elevated, and have since
   normalized on AM labs.  The patient does not take any blood thinners
   except SC heparin.  Possibly systemically absorbed in a cachectic woman
   -Continue to monitor daily coags
   # Hypotension:  Had transient episode of hypotension after HD/ and
   BRBPR, since then BP has remained stable with normal lactates and
   hematocrits, and no fevers
   -continue to monitor clinically
   -Follow up cultures
   # Hypoxia: Likely secondary to mucous plugging, as the patient had
   improved with deep suctioning.  Sputum culture growing gram negative
   rods, likely a colonizer in a chronically vented patient.
   - Continue albuterol and atrovent nebs, would not give antibiotics in
   this setting.
   -Wean trach mask as tolerated
   # ESRD on HD:  Patient unable to tolerate HD secondary to hypotension
   - Consult renal to let her know that she is here, may need daily small
   volume HD if this continues to be a problem
   - Follow daily electrolytes
   #COPD:  Continue Atrovent and Albuterol
   #Anemia: Continue outpatient epo
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient Levoxyl.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient has been experiencing recurrent episodes of bleeding, and the healthcare team is considering prep for a tagged RBC scan or sending her for a bleeding scan with the option of angio if the bleeding persists.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 96.8°C (36°C), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 121/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's hematocrit is stable and above baseline, and her lactate level has decreased from 3.9 to 1.9 mmol/L after a small fluid bolus.

The patient's physical examination reveals a stable condition, with distant heart sounds, clear lungs, and soft abdomen. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and troponin-T level, but her coagulation profile has normalized.

The patient has several medical conditions, including anemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis (ESRD). She is also taking outpatient medications for these conditions, including epo, Levoxyl, and atorvastatin.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for further bleeding, especially if the bleeding persists or worsens.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile may become abnormal again, leading to bleeding or thrombosis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure may drop further, especially if she experiences another episode of bleeding or hypovolemia.
4. Hypoxia: The patient may experience respiratory failure or hypoxia due to mucous plugging or other respiratory complications.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing a nosocomial infection, especially given her chronic respiratory disease and immunosuppressed state.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels may become abnormal due to her chronic kidney disease and hemodialysis.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient may experience cardiac arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock due to her underlying cardiovascular disease and hypotension.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the healthcare team should continue to monitor her closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3981**] is a 71F with a PMH s/f ESRD on HD, remote hx of GIB who
   presents with BRBPR, and transient hypotension/hypoxia after dialysis
   # LGIB: Patient presents with approximately 400cc of BRBPR at HD.
   Continued to have BRBPR during the day shift, but no episodes this past
   evening with a stable hematocrit.
   -Will touch base with GI, can prep today in the ICU for a scope this
   evening, vs. call out to the floor for scope in the AM
   -Daily HCT
   -Holding home dose ASA
   -Has two peripheral IVs for access, with an active type and screen
   # Coagulopathy: Initially transiently elevated, and have since
   normalized on AM labs.  The patient does not take any blood thinners
   except SC heparin.  Possibly systemically absorbed in a cachectic woman
   -Continue to monitor daily coags
   # Hypotension:  Had transient episode of hypotension after HD/ and
   BRBPR, since then BP has remained stable with normal lactates and
   hematocrits, and no fevers/signs of infection
   -continue to monitor clinically
   -Follow up cultures
   # Hypoxia: Likely secondary to mucous plugging, as the patient had
   improved with deep suctioning.  Sputum culture growing gram negative
   rods, likely a colonizer in a chronically vented patient.
   - Continue albuterol and atrovent nebs, would not give antibiotics in
   this setting.
   -Wean trach mask as tolerated
   # ESRD on HD:  Patient unable to tolerate HD secondary to hypotension
   - Consult renal to let her know that she is here, may need daily small
   volume HD if this continues to be a problem
   - Follow daily electrolytes
   #COPD:  Continue Atrovent and Albuterol
   #Anemia: Continue outpatient epo
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient Levoxyl.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient is a 71-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, remote history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and presents with bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR), transient hypotension, and hypoxia after dialysis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 121/53 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 94%. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL, and lactate level of 1.9 mmol/L.

The patient has a history of coagulopathy, which is currently stable, and is not taking any blood thinners except for subcutaneous heparin. She also has a history of hypotension, which has been managed clinically, and is being monitored daily.

The patient's imaging studies show a left basal effusion with atelectasis in the left lower lobe, and a focal consolidation that cannot be excluded. Her microbiology results show a gram-negative rod on sputum culture, which is likely a colonizer in a chronically vented patient.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Preparation for a scope this evening or calling out to the floor for a scope in the morning.
2. Daily hemoglobin and coagulation monitoring.
3. Holding home dose ASA.
4. Monitoring daily coags.
5. Continuing to monitor clinically for hypotension and hypoxia.
6. Following up on cultures.
7. Weaning trach mask as tolerated.
8. Consulting renal to discuss daily small volume hemodialysis if hypotension persists.
9. Continuing outpatient epo and Levoxyl.
10. ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemorrhagic shock due to continued bleeding.
2. Infection secondary to gram-negative rod colonization.
3. Respiratory failure due to atelectasis and focal consolidation.
4. Cardiovascular instability due to hypotension and coagulopathy.
5. Electrolyte imbalance due to hemodialysis and medication use.
6. Anemia and hypothyroidism requiring adjustment of outpatient therapy.
7. Cachexia and malnutrition due to chronic illness and gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to reduced dose SC heparin."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 71-year-old female with a history of ESRD on HD, remote history of GIB, and chronic lung disease, presents to the ICU with respiratory distress, BRBPR, and transient hypotension/hypoxia after dialysis. She has been experiencing mucous plugging, which improved with deep suctioning. Her sputum culture shows gram-negative rods, likely a colonizer. She has maroon-colored stools, but GI does not recommend a colonoscopy at this time. The patient is scheduled for dialysis today and has ongoing treatment for COPD, anemia, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and BRBPR increase the risk of respiratory failure, which could lead to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's maroon-colored stools and BRBPR indicate ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to further complications such as hypovolemic shock, anemia, and coagulopathy.
3. Infection: The patient's sputum culture shows gram-negative rods, which could indicate a respiratory infection. The patient's chronic lung disease and immunosuppression increase the risk of pneumonia and other respiratory infections.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's ESRD and chronic lung disease increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as hypertension, arrhythmias, and cardiac failure.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's tube feeds may not be providing adequate nutrition, which could lead to malnutrition and related complications such as weakness, fatigue, and impaired wound healing.
6. Wound Complications: The patient's auto-amputating toes increase the risk of wound complications such as infection, gangrene, and amputation.
7. Thromboembolic Events: The patient's ESRD and chronic lung disease increase the risk of thromboembolic events such as DVT and PE.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may not be well-controlled, which could lead to related complications such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance.
9. Anemia: The patient's anemia may not be well-controlled, which could lead to related complications such as fatigue, weakness, and impaired wound healing.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and nutritional status to prevent and manage potential complications."

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications:

**Summary:**

The patient, a 71-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), presents with bronchospasm, respiratory distress, and bleeding from the rectum (BRBPR). She had an episode of hypoxia requiring bagging and has been experiencing transient hypotension and hypoxia after dialysis. The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is currently on hemodialysis. She is also being treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypothyroidism.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's BRBPR may continue or worsen, leading to further bleeding and potential complications such as anemia, hypovolemic shock, or even death.
3. Infection: The patient's sputum culture growing gram-negative rods may indicate a potential infection, which could spread and cause sepsis or other complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's transient hypotension after dialysis may be a sign of underlying cardiac or vascular issues, which could worsen if not managed properly.
5. Anemia: The patient's ongoing bleeding and potential need for transfusions may exacerbate her anemia, leading to further complications.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's ongoing dialysis and potential need for transfusions may lead to electrolyte imbalances, which could worsen her condition.
7. Thrombotic complications: The patient's ongoing dialysis and potential need for transfusions may increase her risk of thrombotic complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
8. Infection-related complications: The patient's ongoing infection may lead to complications such as sepsis, organ failure, or death.

**Plan:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide supportive care as needed.
2. Manage the patient's bleeding and BRBPR with continued suctioning and potentially a colonoscopy or tagged scan.
3. Continue antibiotic treatment for the patient's suspected infection.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and consider further treatment if hypotension persists.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and electrolyte levels, and provide supportive care as needed.
6. Consider further imaging or testing to rule out other potential complications.
7. Continue to consult with the patient's primary care physician and other specialists as needed to manage her condition."

Summary:

The patient is a 68-inch tall, 58.5 kg individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and BRBPR (blood-tinged respiratory secretions). The patient's oxygen saturation acutely dropped to low 60s, but improved significantly after bagging. The patient received Benadryl and has a history of unknown allergies to caffeine, butalbital, barbiturates, and xanthines. The patient has been receiving Lansoprazole and Heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, and blood pressure of 110/43 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheal mask with oxygen delivery.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's BRBPR and low oxygen saturation levels suggest a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's Gram stain of sputum culture shows Gram-negative rods, which may indicate a severe infection, potentially leading to sepsis.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's maroon-colored stool and recent blood transfusions suggest a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney injury.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and magnesium, are abnormal, which may lead to arrhythmias or other complications.
6. Blood product transfusion reaction: The patient's unknown allergies and recent blood transfusions increase the risk of a transfusion reaction.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's prophylactic heparin sodium and history of immobilization increase the risk of DVT.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's recent blood transfusions and immobilization increase the risk of stress ulcer.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory support and recent blood transfusions increase the risk of VAP.

Further evaluation and monitoring are necessary to address these potential complications and ensure the patient's safety and well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3981**] is a 71F with a PMH s/f ESRD on HD, remote hx of GIB who
   presents with BRBPR, and transient hypotension/hypoxia after dialysis.
   1) Hypoxia: Likely secondary to mucous plugging, as the patient had
   improved with deep suctioning.  Sputum culture growing gram negative
   rods, likely a colonizer in a chronically vented patient.
   - Continue albuterol and atrovent nebs, would not give antibiotics in
   this setting.
   -Wean trach mask as tolerated
   2)LGIB: Patient presents with approximately 400cc of BRBPR at HD.
   Continued to have BRBPR during the day shift, but no episodes this past
   evening with a stable hematocrit.
   -Will touch base with GI, can prep today in the ICU for a scope this
   evening, vs. call out to the floor for scope in the AM
   -Daily HCT
   -Holding home dose ASA
   -Has two peripheral IVs for access, with an active type and screen
   3)ESRD on HD:  Patient unable to tolerate HD secondary to hypotension
   - Consult renal to let her know that she is here, may need daily small
   volume HD if this continues to be a problem
   - Follow daily electrolytes
   4)COPD:  Continue Atrovent and Albuterol
   5)Anemia: Continue outpatient Epogen.
   6) Hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient Levoxyl.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3981**] is a 71F with a PMH s/f ESRD on HD, remote hx of GIB who
   presents with BRBPR, and transient hypotension/hypoxia after dialysis.
   1) Hypoxia: Likely secondary to mucous plugging, as the patient had
   improved with deep suctioning.  Sputum culture growing gram negative
   rods, likely a colonizer in a chronically vented patient.
   - Continue albuterol and atrovent nebs, would not give antibiotics in
   this setting.
   -Wean trach mask as tolerated
   2)LGIB: Patient presents with approximately 400cc of BRBPR at HD.
   Continued to have BRBPR during the day shift, but no episodes this past
   evening with a stable hematocrit.
   -Will touch base with GI, can prep today in the ICU for a scope this
   evening, vs. call out to the floor for scope in the AM
   -Daily HCT
   -Holding home dose ASA
   -Has two peripheral IVs for access, with an active type and screen
   3)ESRD on HD:  Patient unable to tolerate HD secondary to hypotension
   - Consult renal to let her know that she is here, may need daily small
   volume HD if this continues to be a problem
   - Follow daily electrolytes
   4)COPD:  Continue Atrovent and Albuterol
   5)Anemia: Continue outpatient Epogen.
   6) Hypothyroidism: Continue outpatient Levoxyl.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient, a 71-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), presents with respiratory distress, bronchospasm, and gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient experienced acute hypoxia, requiring bagging, and has been treated with albuterol and atrovent nebs. The patient's sputum culture shows gram-negative rods, likely a colonizer in a chronically vented patient.

The patient has ongoing GIB, with approximately 400cc of bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) at HD. The patient's hematocrit has been stable, and daily HCT is planned. The patient's home dose of aspirin has been held.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia may lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing GIB may lead to further bleeding, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Infection: The patient's sputum culture shows gram-negative rods, which may indicate a potential infection.
4. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia may lead to muscle cramps, tetany, and cardiac arrhythmias if not properly managed.
5. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's hypomagnesemia may lead to muscle cramps, weakness, and cardiac arrhythmias if not properly managed.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues if not properly managed.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased metabolism if not properly managed.
8. DVT: The patient's immobility and underlying medical conditions may increase the risk of DVT.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient's stress and underlying medical conditions may increase the risk of stress ulcer.

Based on the patient's condition, further management should focus on:

1. Managing the patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia with oxygen therapy and bronchodilators.
2. Controlling the patient's GIB with medications and fluids.
3. Monitoring the patient's laboratory results for signs of infection, anemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.
4. Managing the patient's underlying medical conditions, including ESRD, COPD, and hypothyroidism.
5. Preventing DVT with compression stockings and early mobilization.
6. Monitoring the patient's stress levels and providing psychological support.
7. Considering the patient's code status and end-of-life care."
