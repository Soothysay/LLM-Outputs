   Assessment and Plan
   31 yo M w/ biliary atresia s/p liver transplant, cirrhosis, ESRD on HD,
   MSSA bacteremia, recurrent empyemas, pericardial window, presents with
   respiratory distress and bleeding with thoracentesis.
   .
   1. Respiratory Distress:  Likely due to empyema, metabolic
   derangement.  Is now s/p thoracentesis with blood in pleural fluid as
   well as low pH suggesting exudative infection.  Thoracentesis was
   complicated by significant bleeding post-procedure, posing concern for
   hemothorax.  Due to liver failure and ESRD, he has dysfunctional
   platelets and low levels of clotting factors.  He has received 2 units
   of FFP prior to thoracentesis, and 3 additional units following
   procedure given oozing from site. Received DDVAP yesterday morning.
   - will monitor respiratory status closely with concerns for hemothorax
   - F/U with thoracic surgery for and possible definitive procedure for
   empyema given low pH and HCT of 12.5 in pleural fluid
   - Trend CXR
   - oxygen for comfort
   .
   2. Continued Bleeding
 will be difficult to correct his coagulopathy
   due to underlying medical co-morbidities and worsening liver function.
   - receiving pRBC transfusion now, will obtain post transfusion HCT
   - FFP x 2, additional pRBC
   - Serial HCTs and coags
   - Amicar gtt (continuous)
   - DDAVP daily for 3 days (currently day 2 of 3)
   - Dialysis may be helpful in correcting platelet dysfunction, though
   patient may be too tenuous for HD or UF.
   - can consider topical fibrin to help with hemostasis of thoracentesis
   site
   .
   3. Low grade Temps, Leukocytosis: Concern for worsening infection.  He
   is s/p 7 days of Vanc/Cefepime which ended [**2136-2-27**] for VAP. He has a hx
   of MSSA bacteremia and empyema and was on Nafcillin, then Cefazolin
   dosed with HD.  His is on PO Vancomycin for emperic C. Diff coverage
   with multiple C. Diff samples negative.  He has a history of
   Strongyloides antibody positive s/p 1 dose of Ivermectin.  Abx were
   broadened yesterday to Vanc/Cefepime.  WBC trending down today, patient
   afebrile.
   - will continue broad spectrum antibiotcs with Vanc/Cefepime
   - f/u culture data include blood, stool and pleural fluid
   - continue prednisone at 10mg PO qday for adrenal insufficiency
   - f/u ID recs
   - d/c PO vancomycin
   .
   4. Worsening Liver Failure: s/p liver transplant at age 4 for biliar
   atresia.  Bilirubin has climbed to 28 since [**2-11**] with rise in INR and
   drop in platelets.  Unclear precipitant. RUQ u/s without new portal
   vein thrombus or ascites.  Infection may be the preciptating factor
   given empyema.  No signs of GI bleeding but has bleeding into pleural
   space.
   - continue to trend daily LFTs
   - f/u with thoracic regarding definative management of empyema and
   possiblity of listing for renal transplant
   - liver recs
   - transplant recs
   - daily tacro levels
   - lactulose [**Hospital1 **] for encephalopathy
   .
   5. ESRD on HD: Dialysis on T/Thurs/Sat. Course complicated by HD line
   infection with MSSA, now s/p new line.
   - continue abx dosed with HD
   - nephrology recs
   - Will F/U with renal team on timing of HD given bleeding
   .
   6. Adrenal insufficiency: Low cortisol level while septic in ICU.  Has
   been tapered to hydrocort 50mg IV BID [**2-25**], to prednisone 20mg daily on
   [**2-27**].  Got Prednisone 15mg on [**2-29**], 10mg on [**3-1**].
   - will continue Prednisone 10mg PO qday
   - No stress dose steroids in light of large infectious burden

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old man with a complex medical history, including biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, ESRD on HD, MSSA bacteremia, recurrent empyemas, and pericardial window. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress, bleeding, and low-grade fever.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to empyema, and the risk of respiratory failure is high.
2. Hemothorax: The patient has significant bleeding from the thoracentesis site, which may lead to a hemothorax, a life-threatening condition.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia and empyema, and his current temperature is 36.8°C (98.3°F), which may indicate a worsening infection.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's liver failure and ESRD have caused dysfunctional platelets and low levels of clotting factors, which may lead to uncontrolled bleeding.
5. Liver failure: The patient's bilirubin level has climbed to 28, and his INR and platelet count are dropping, indicating worsening liver failure.
6. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency, and his cortisol level is low, which may lead to further complications.
7. ESRD on HD: The patient's ESRD is complicated by HD line infection with MSSA, and his course is complicated by bleeding.
8. Encephalopathy: The patient's bilirubin level is high, and he has a history of liver transplant, which may lead to encephalopathy.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen for comfort, and his respiratory status will be closely monitored.
2. Bleeding management: The patient is receiving pRBC transfusion, FFP, and amicar to control bleeding.
3. Infection management: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and his culture data will be monitored.
4. Liver support: The patient is receiving lactulose for encephalopathy, and his daily LFTs will be trended.
5. ESRD management: The patient will continue to receive HD, and his course will be complicated by bleeding.
6. Adrenal insufficiency management: The patient will continue to receive prednisone 10mg PO qday, and no stress dose steroids will be given due to his large infectious burden.

The patient's current disposition is ICU care, and his code status is DNR (do not resuscitate)."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a chronically ill man, is being treated in the ICU for multiple conditions. He has a history of jaundice, ascites, and encephalopathy, and is currently experiencing septic shock, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. He has a PICC line and dialysis catheter in place, and is receiving vasopressors and morphine for pain management. His vital signs are unstable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 119 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/46 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 92%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure are all elevated, indicating a possible septic response. This could lead to further organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's SpO2 is 92%, indicating mild hypoxemia. This could progress to severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure if not addressed.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating kidney damage. This could lead to further kidney damage and increased mortality.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, indicating a possible coagulopathy. This could lead to bleeding complications and increased mortality.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's bilirubin level is elevated, indicating liver dysfunction. This could lead to further liver damage and increased mortality.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's stool culture is positive for C. difficile, which could lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and further complications.
7. Septic Shock: The patient's vasopressor requirements are increasing, indicating a possible septic shock. This could lead to further organ dysfunction and increased mortality.

Based on this information, it is clear that the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications. It is essential to closely monitor his vital signs and laboratory results, and to adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   31 yo M w/ biliary atresia s/p liver transplant, cirrhosis, ESRD on HD,
   MSSA bacteremia, recurrent empyemas, pericardial window, presents with
   respiratory distress and bleeding with thoracentesis.
   .
   1. Respiratory Distress:  Likely due to empyema.  Is now s/p
   thoracentesis with blood in pleural fluid as well as low pH suggesting
   infection.  Thoracentesis was complicated by significant bleeding
   post-procedure, posing concern for hemothorax.  Due to liver failure
   and ESRD, he has dysfunctional platelets and low levels of clotting
   factors.  He has received 2 units of FFP prior to thoracentesis, and 3
   additional units following procedure given oozing from site. Received
   DDVAP yesterday morning.
   - will monitor respiratory status closely with concerns for hemothorax
   - F/U with thoracic surgery for definative procedure for empyema given
   low pH and HCT of 12.5 in pleural fluid
   - Trend CXR
   - Serial HCTs and coags
   - Amicar gtt ???
   .
   2. Low grade Temps, Leukocytosis: Concern for worsening infection.  He
   is s/p 7 days of Vanc/Cefepime which ended [**2136-2-27**] for VAP. He has a hx
   of MSSA bacteremia and empyema and was on Nafcillin, then Cefazolin
   dosed with HD.  His is on PO Vancomycin for emperic C. Diff coverage
   with multiple C. Diff samples negative.  He has a history of
   Strongyloides antibody positive s/p 1 dose of Ivermectin.  Abx were
   broadened yesterday to Vanc/Cefepime.  WBC trending down today, patient
   afebrile.
   - will continue broad spectrum antibiotcs with Vanc/Cefepime
   - f/u culture data include blood, stool and pleural fluid
   - continue prednisone at 10mg PO qday for adrenal insufficiency
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   3. Worsening Liver Failure: s/p liver transplant at age 4 for biliar
   atresia.  Bilirubin has climbed to 28 since [**2-11**] with rise in INR and
   drop in platelets.  Unclear precipitant. RUQ u/s without new portal
   vein thrombus or ascites.  Infection may be the preciptating factor
   given empyema.  No signs of GI bleeding but has bleeding into pleural
   space.
   - continue to trend daily LFTs
   - f/u with thoracic regarding definative management of empyema and
   possiblity of listing for renal transplant
   - liver recs
   - transplant recs
   - daily tacro levels
   - lactulose [**Hospital1 **] for encephalopathy

   4. ESRD on HD: Dialysis on T/Thurs/Sat. Course complicated by HD line
   infection with MSSA, now s/p new line.
   - continue abx dosed with HD
   - nephrology recs
   - Will F/U with renal team on timing of HD given bleeding
   .
   5. Adrenal insufficiency: Low cortisol level while septic in ICU.  Has
   been tapered to hydrocort 50mg IV BID [**2-25**], to prednisone 20mg daily on
   [**2-27**].  Got Prednisone 15mg on [**2-29**], 10mg on [**3-1**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 31-year-old male with a history of biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with respiratory distress, bleeding, and low-grade fever. He has a history of MSSA bacteremia and empyema, and has received antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime. He has also received two units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) due to bleeding complications from thoracentesis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemothorax: The patient's bleeding complications from thoracentesis pose a risk for hemothorax, which could worsen his respiratory status.
2. Infection: The patient's low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures suggest a potential infection, which could worsen his condition.
3. Worsening Liver Failure: The patient's bilirubin levels have risen, and his INR and platelet counts have decreased, suggesting worsening liver failure.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient's HD course has been complicated by HD line infection with MSSA, and he requires ongoing management of his HD line and antibiotics.
5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency and requires ongoing management with prednisone and hydrocortisone.
6. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to empyema, and he requires ongoing management with antibiotics and consideration for surgical intervention.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has bleeding into his pleural space, which could be a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding or other underlying gastrointestinal issues.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider surgical intervention for empyema.
3. Trend daily liver function tests (LFTs) to monitor the patient's liver function.
4. Continue to manage the patient's adrenal insufficiency with prednisone and hydrocortisone.
5. Monitor the patient's HD line and antibiotics to prevent further complications.
6. Consider listing the patient for renal transplant given his ESRD and ongoing management of his HD line.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider further evaluation and management of any bleeding or other gastrointestinal issues."

Summary:

The patient, a 31-year-old male with biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, has been in the ICU for an unknown duration. He has a history of MSSA bacteremia, recurrent empyemas, and a pericardial window. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, bleeding, and low-grade temperatures, and has failed to respond to transfusions. A family meeting was held, and it was decided to make the patient a comfort measures only (CMO) patient, stopping all medications except for those for comfort, and discontinuing further transfusions, labs, and imaging.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is precarious, and the decision not to intubate may lead to further deterioration.
2. Continued Bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding may worsen, and the lack of further transfusions may exacerbate the situation.
3. Worsening Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is likely to deteriorate further, which may impact his overall prognosis.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient's end-stage renal disease will continue to progress, and further hemodialysis may not be feasible.
5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's adrenal function may continue to decline, leading to potential adrenal crisis.
6. Pain Control: The patient's pain management plan may not be adequate, and further interventions may be necessary to ensure comfort.
7. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and ongoing bleeding may increase his risk of developing further infections.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's pericardial window and history of MSSA bacteremia may increase his risk of developing cardiac complications, such as pericarditis or cardiac tamponade.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his care plan accordingly to ensure his comfort and prevent further deterioration."

   31 yo M w/ biliary atresia s/p liver transplant, cirrhosis, ESRD on HD,
   MSSA bacteremia, recurrent empyemas, pericardial window, presents with
   respiratory distress and bleeding with thoracentesis. Patient failed to
   respond appropriately to transfusions yesterday and has had continued
   bleeding. Family meeting led by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] resulted in decision to make
   patient CMO.
   1. Respiratory Distress: Breathing appears labored but patient
   generally denies subjective SOB.
   - Continue nebs PRN
   - Oxygen PRN (will not intubate)
   2. Continued Bleeding: Dressing changes PRN. Patient continues to ooze.
   - No further transfusions
   - Not trending Hct, plts
   - Lidocaine patch to site of thoracentesis for pain control
   3. Low grade Temps, Leukocytosis:
   - No longer trending labs or imaging
   - Off antibiotics

Summary:

The patient, a 31-year-old male with biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, and ESRD on HD, has been made comfort measures only (CMO) after a family meeting. He has been experiencing respiratory distress, bleeding, and low-grade temperatures, and has failed to respond to transfusions. His labs show worsening liver failure, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. He has been taken off antibiotics and will not receive further transfusions or labs. The plan is to transfer him to the hospital ward 10, where he will receive supportive care focused on keeping him comfortable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure and potentially requiring intubation.
2. Bleeding: The patient's continued bleeding may lead to further hemodynamic instability and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Worsening Liver Failure: The patient's liver failure may continue to worsen, leading to further decompensation and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Infection: The patient's lack of antibiotics and continued bleeding may increase his risk of infection, particularly in the respiratory and abdominal areas.
5. Pain Management: The patient's pain may not be adequately controlled, leading to further discomfort and potentially worsening his condition.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's HD and continued bleeding may lead to electrolyte imbalances, potentially exacerbating his condition.
7. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's adrenal insufficiency may worsen, leading to further decompensation and potentially life-threatening complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   31 yo M w/ biliary atresia s/p liver transplant, cirrhosis, ESRD on HD,
   MSSA bacteremia, recurrent empyemas, pericardial window, presents with
   respiratory distress and bleeding with thoracentesis. Patient failed to
   respond appropriately to transfusions yesterday and has had continued
   bleeding. Family meeting led by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] resulted in decision to make
   patient CMO.
   1. Respiratory Distress: Breathing appears labored but patient
   generally denies subjective SOB.
   - Continue nebs PRN
   - Oxygen PRN (will not intubate)
   2. Continued Bleeding: Dressing changes PRN. Patient continues to ooze.
   - No further transfusions
   - Not trending Hct, plts
   - Lidocaine patch to site of thoracentesis for pain control
   3. Low grade Temps, Leukocytosis:
   - No longer trending labs or imaging
   - Off antibiotics
   4. Worsening Liver Failure: Patient not a transplant candidate.
   - Consider lactulose PRN if helpful for mental status, interaction with
   family
   5. ESRD on HD:
   - No further HD
   6. Adrenal insufficiency:
   - No further medications
   7. Pain control: Patient currently reporting minimal pain.
   - Lidocaine patch as above
   - IV morphine (consider drip if pain worsens)
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes with HD, diet as tolerated
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots
   -Bowel regimen lactulose  (hold for diarrhea)
   -Pain management with home regimen of oxycodone
   -PPI
   # Access: PICC line, HD catheter
   # Code: DNR but OK to intubate (family wants time to be at bedside)
   # Communication: Patient; family meeting today at 1300 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**]
   # Emergency Contact:  Father: [**Name (NI) 8405**] [**Name (NI) 8404**]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12491**]
   # Disposition: Plan to transfer to [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] 10 this morning

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 31-year-old male with a complex medical history, including biliary atresia, liver transplant, cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, MSSA bacteremia, recurrent empyemas, and a pericardial window. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and bleeding following thoracentesis.

The patient has failed to respond to transfusions and has continued bleeding, leading to the decision to make him comfort measures only (CMO). The plan is to transfer him to the hospital ward this morning.

The patient's current vital signs include:

* Temperature: 35.9°C (96.6°F)
* Heart rate: 102 bpm (100-121 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 90/60 mmHg (67/41-133/73 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (14-32 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 92%
* SpO2: 92%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.6 (10.8-23.5)
* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL (7.4-12.5 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 108 (89-221)
* Creatinine: 2.8 mg/dL (0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Glucose: 96 mg/dL (70-110 mg/dL)

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

* Respiratory distress, which may worsen due to the patient's underlying lung disease and bleeding
* Continued bleeding, which may lead to further complications and decreased oxygenation
* Worsening liver failure, which may lead to further complications and decreased ability to metabolize medications
* ESRD on HD, which may lead to further complications and decreased ability to remove waste products
* Adrenal insufficiency, which may lead to further complications and decreased ability to respond to stress
* Pain control, which may be challenging due to the patient's underlying condition and bleeding

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing nebs PRN and oxygen PRN
* No further transfusions
* No further HD
* Consider lactulose PRN for mental status and interaction with family
* No further medications for adrenal insufficiency
* Lidocaine patch for pain control
* IV morphine for pain control (consider drip if pain worsens)

The patient's code status is comfort measures only, and the plan is to transfer him to the hospital ward this morning."
