   Imaging: Final Report
   REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Acute hypoxemia.
   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2145-1-22**].
   The current study was obtained with significant motion artifacts
   preventing
   from precise comparison with the prior study, but the impression is
   that there
   is increased bilateral perihilar vascular engorgement with potentially
   present
   bilateral perihilar opacities, findings that are worrisome for interval
   progression of pulmonary edema, currently interstitial. Repeated
   radiograph is highly recommended. Bibasal atelectases are present, and
   small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Cardiomegaly and
   prominence of the main pulmonary artery are unchanged and are
   consistent with pulmonary hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity, OSA (noncompliance on BIPAP),
   COPD, history of PE. Since admission, pt treated with azithro for
   bronchitis.
           Latest ABG indicates respiratory acidosis.  Causes of
   respiratory falure include:
           Infection, PE, CHF, MI, OSA.
   - continue azithro and broaden ABX coverage to treat HAP
   (vanc/cefepime) if clinical condition deteriorates or becomes febrile.
   - continue IV lasix for goal -1L (pt received laxix IV 40mg x 2
   overnight after BNP showed 5977)
   - continue ROMI with enzymes
   - continue metoprolol and warfarin for atrial fibrillation
   - repeat echocardiogram
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - continue nebs
   - ativan PRN anxiety
   2.       COPD
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   - continue heparin (one more day) and coumadin with goal INR 2.5-3.5
   4.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   5.       Anemia
 baseline HCT 30-38. Last iron studies in [**2141**] with
   normal ferritin and iron. MCV is 107, suggesting either B12 or folate
   deficiency.
   - continue home iron.
   - order B12 and folate levels
   6.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN. Baseline 1.3-1.8.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   7.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   8.       Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   9.       Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   10.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine
   11.    Hypertension
   - continue home metoprolol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: Final Report
   REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Acute hypoxemia.
   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2145-1-22**].
   The current study was obtained with significant motion artifacts
   preventing
   from precise comparison with the prior study, but the impression is
   that there
   is increased bilateral perihilar vascular engorgement with potentially
   present
   bilateral perihilar opacities, findings that are worrisome for interval
   progression of pulmonary edema, currently interstitial. Repeated
   radiograph is highly recommended. Bibasal atelectases are present, and
   small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Cardiomegaly and
   prominence of the main pulmonary artery are unchanged and are
   consistent with pulmonary hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity, OSA (noncompliance on BIPAP),
   COPD, history of PE. Since admission, pt treated with azithro for
   bronchitis.
           Latest ABG indicates respiratory acidosis.  Causes of
   respiratory falure include:
           Infection, PE, CHF, MI, OSA.
   - continue azithro and broaden ABX coverage to treat HAP
   (vanc/cefepime) if clinical condition deteriorates or becomes febrile.
   - continue IV lasix for goal -1L (pt received laxix IV 40mg x 2
   overnight after BNP showed 5977)
   - continue ROMI with enzymes
   - continue metoprolol and warfarin for atrial fibrillation
   - repeat echocardiogram
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - continue nebs
   - ativan PRN anxiety
   2.       COPD
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   - continue heparin (one more day) and coumadin with goal INR 2.5-3.5
   4.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   5.       Anemia
 baseline HCT 30-38. Last iron studies in [**2141**] with
   normal ferritin and iron. MCV is 107, suggesting either B12 or folate
   deficiency.
   - continue home iron.
   - order B12 and folate levels
   6.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN. Baseline 1.3-1.8.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   7.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   8.       Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   9.       Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   10.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine
   11.    Hypertension
   - continue home metoprolol

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of morbid obesity, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and pulmonary embolism (PE), who presented with right lower extremity (RLE) pain and shortness of breath (SOB). She was treated with azithromycin and heparin for subtherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR). On the floor, she was found to be taking her bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP) off overnight with a saturation level of 40%. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with desaturations and somnolence.

The patient's 24-hour events include:

* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels increased
* Troponin level increased to 0.02 ng/mL
* Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level increased to 5977 pg/mL
* Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed respiratory acidosis
* Chest radiograph showed bilateral perihilar vascular engorgement and potential bilateral perihilar opacities, consistent with pulmonary edema

The patient's laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count (WBC) 7.2 K/uL
* Hematocrit (Hct) 32.4%
* Platelet count (Plt) 228 K/uL
* Troponin level 0.02 ng/mL
* BNP level 5977 pg/mL
* Creatinine level 1.4 mg/dL
* Sodium level 138 mmol/L
* Potassium level 4.9 mmol/L

   Imaging: Final Report
   REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Acute hypoxemia.
   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2145-1-22**].
   The current study was obtained with significant motion artifacts
   preventing
   from precise comparison with the prior study, but the impression is
   that there
   is increased bilateral perihilar vascular engorgement with potentially
   present
   bilateral perihilar opacities, findings that are worrisome for interval
   progression of pulmonary edema, currently interstitial. Repeated
   radiograph is highly recommended. Bibasal atelectases are present, and
   small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Cardiomegaly and
   prominence of the main pulmonary artery are unchanged and are
   consistent with pulmonary hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP), history of PE. Since admission, pt treated
   with azithro for bronchitis.
           Latest ABG indicates respiratory acidosis.  Causes of
   respiratory falure include:
           Infection, PE, CHF, MI, OSA.
   - discontinue azithro (patient has completed 5 day course)
   - broaden ABX coverage to treat HAP (vanc/cefepime) if clinical
   condition deteriorates or becomes febrile
   - continue IV lasix 40mg for goal -2L for today to treat right sided
   heart failure
   - start lasix drip
   - continue ROMI with enzymes
   - repeat echocardiogram
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - calculate urine anion gap
   - ativan PRN anxiety
   2.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   -          discontinue heparin (patient has been in therapeutic INR
   range of [**1-20**] for 24 hours)
   -          restart coumadin tomorrow (INR today was 3.1)
   4.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   5.       Anemia
 baseline HCT 30-38. Last iron studies in [**2141**] with
   normal ferritin and iron. MCV is 107, suggesting either B12 or folate
   deficiency.
   - continue home iron.
   - followup B12 and folate levels
   6.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN. Baseline 1.3-1.8.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   7.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   8.       Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   9.       Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   10.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine
   11.    Hypertension
   -          change home metoprolol to more frequent dosing (1.5mg Q6H)
   12.    Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of AFib
   - continue metoprolol and warfarin for rate control and
   anticoagulation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Imaging: Final Report
   REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Acute hypoxemia.
   Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2145-1-22**].
   The current study was obtained with significant motion artifacts
   preventing
   from precise comparison with the prior study, but the impression is
   that there
   is increased bilateral perihilar vascular engorgement with potentially
   present
   bilateral perihilar opacities, findings that are worrisome for interval
   progression of pulmonary edema, currently interstitial. Repeated
   radiograph is highly recommended. Bibasal atelectases are present, and
   small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Cardiomegaly and
   prominence of the main pulmonary artery are unchanged and are
   consistent with pulmonary hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP), history of PE. Since admission, pt treated
   with azithro for bronchitis.
           Latest ABG indicates respiratory acidosis.  Causes of
   respiratory falure include:
           Infection, PE, CHF, MI, OSA.
   - discontinue azithro (patient has completed 5 day course)
   - broaden ABX coverage to treat HAP (vanc/cefepime) if clinical
   condition deteriorates or becomes febrile
   - continue IV lasix 40mg for goal -2L for today to treat right sided
   heart failure
   - start lasix drip
   - continue ROMI with enzymes
   - repeat echocardiogram
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - calculate urine anion gap
   - ativan PRN anxiety
   2.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   -          discontinue heparin (patient has been in therapeutic INR
   range of [**1-20**] for 24 hours)
   -          restart coumadin tomorrow (INR today was 3.1)
   4.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   5.       Anemia
 baseline HCT 30-38. Last iron studies in [**2141**] with
   normal ferritin and iron. MCV is 107, suggesting either B12 or folate
   deficiency.
   - continue home iron.
   - followup B12 and folate levels
   6.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN. Baseline 1.3-1.8.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   7.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   8.       Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   9.       Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   10.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine
   11.    Hypertension
   -          change home metoprolol to more frequent dosing (1.5mg Q6H)
   12.    Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of AFib
   - continue metoprolol and warfarin for rate control and
   anticoagulation.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of morbid obesity, hypothyroidism, DM, and PE, who presented with RLE pain and SOB. She was treated with azithro and started on heparin for subtherapeutic INR. The patient developed desaturations/somnolence and was found to be taking her BIPAP off overnight with SaO2=40%.

The patient has the following medical complications:

1. Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has a history of obesity, OSA, and PE, which may contribute to her respiratory failure. The latest ABG indicates respiratory acidosis, and the patient is likely to have a multifactorial respiratory failure.
2. Obstructive lung disease: The patient has a history of asthma, and her lung function may be compromised due to her obesity and OSA.
3. PE: The patient has a history of PE, and her initial presentation was clinically concerning for PE. She was treated with heparin, and her INR was in the therapeutic range.
4. OSA: The patient has a history of OSA, and her BIPAP settings need to be titrated for best ventilation.
5. Anemia: The patient has a baseline HCT of 30-38%, and her MCV is 107, suggesting either B12 or folate deficiency.
6. CKD: The patient has a history of DM and HTN, which may have contributed to her CKD.
7. Chronic pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain, and her pain meds need to be continued once her respiratory status improves.
8. Type 2 DM: The patient has a history of DM, and her blood sugar levels need to be monitored and controlled.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, and her statin needs to be continued.
10. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and her levothyroxine needs to be continued.
11. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and her metoprolol needs to be changed to more frequent dosing.
12. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of AFib, and her metoprolol and warfarin need to be continued for rate control and anticoagulation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's medical complications and potential complications include:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's SpO2 levels are 96%, indicating mild hypoxemia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires NIPPV and has a trans thoracic echo showing mild LVH with an EF of 55%.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a history of allergies to various medications and has received multiple antibiotics, which may increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 228 x 10^9/L, which is slightly low.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are 159 mg/dL, which may indicate hyperglycemia.
6. Acidosis: The patient's pH levels are 7.29, which may indicate acidosis.
7. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are 8.0 mg/dL, which may indicate hypocalcemia.
8. Hypomagnesemia: The patient's magnesium levels are 2.1 mg/dL, which may indicate hypomagnesemia.
9. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient's phosphate levels are 4.1 mg/dL, which may indicate hyperphosphatemia.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. ICU care: The patient will continue to receive ICU care to monitor her vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Nutrition: The patient will receive NPO for now, and her nutrition will be reassessed in the future.

   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP), possibly history of PE. ABGs show respiratory
   acidosis without adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now
   increased to 30. Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA,
   developing CHF, infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and
   echo was normal.
   - continue IV lasix at 8mg/hr or goal -1L for today given her elevated
   BNP and edema
   - continue ROMI with enzymes
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures
   2.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   -          discontinue heparin (patient has been in therapeutic INR
   range of [**1-20**] for 24 hours)
   -          hold coumadin today (INR today was 4.8). No need to reverse
   her if not bleeding.
   4.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   5.       Anemia
 baseline HCT 30-38. Last iron studies in [**2141**] with
   normal ferritin and iron. MCV is 107, however B12 and Folate levels
   were above reference range.  Possible cause of anemia is
   hypothyroidism.
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   6.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN. Baseline 1.3-1.8.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   7.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   8.       Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   9.       Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   10.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine
   11.    Hypertension
   - continue home metoprolol to more frequent dosing (1.5mg Q6H)
   12.    Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of AFib
   - continue metoprolol and warfarin for rate control and
   anticoagulation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP), possibly history of PE. ABGs show respiratory
   acidosis without adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now
   increased to 30. Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA,
   developing CHF, infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and
   echo was normal.
   - continue IV lasix at 8mg/hr or goal -1L for today given her elevated
   BNP and edema
   - continue ROMI with enzymes
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures
   2.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   -          discontinue heparin (patient has been in therapeutic INR
   range of [**1-20**] for 24 hours)
   -          hold coumadin today (INR today was 4.8). No need to reverse
   her if not bleeding.
   4.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   5.       Anemia
 baseline HCT 30-38. Last iron studies in [**2141**] with
   normal ferritin and iron. MCV is 107, however B12 and Folate levels
   were above reference range.  Possible cause of anemia is
   hypothyroidism.
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   6.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN. Baseline 1.3-1.8.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   7.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   8.       Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   9.       Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   10.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine
   11.    Hypertension
   - continue home metoprolol to more frequent dosing (1.5mg Q6H)
   12.    Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of AFib
   - continue metoprolol and warfarin for rate control and
   anticoagulation.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, pulmonary embolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypothyroidism. She presented to the hospital with right lower extremity pain and shortness of breath.

Current status:

* The patient is intubated and receiving non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV) with a Bipap mask.
* She has mild left ventricular hypertrophy with an ejection fraction of 55% on echocardiogram.
* Her blood gases show respiratory acidosis without adequate metabolic compensation.
* Her laboratory results show anemia, chronic kidney disease, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential medical complications:

* Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and she may require further interventions such as mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
* Obstructive lung disease: The patient has a history of asthma and may require further treatment with bronchodilators or corticosteroids.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and may require further anticoagulation therapy.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to her hypothyroidism, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary.
* Chronic kidney disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may be exacerbated by her diabetes and hypertension, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary.

Recommendations:

* Continue IV lasix at 8mg/hr or goal -1L for today given her elevated BNP and edema.
* Continue ROMI with enzymes.
* Titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation.
* Continue gentle ativan PRN.
* Follow up sputum cultures.
* Continue advair and monteleukast as above.
* Discontinue heparin and hold coumadin today.
* Continue BIPAP as above.
* Monitor I/Os and avoid nephrotoxins.
* Continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves.
* Continue DM diet and FS QID.
* Continue home statin.
* Continue home levothyroxine.
* Continue metoprolol and warfarin for rate control and anticoagulation.

ICU care:

   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP). ABGs show respiratory acidosis without
   adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now increased to 30.
   Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA, developing CHF,
   infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and echo was normal.
   - decrease IV lasix to 4mg/hr or goal -1L for today given her elevated
   BNP and edema
   - transition to bolus lasix
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures from yesterday
   - repeat sputum cultures today given productive cough
   - CXR today given productive cough
   2.       Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of Afib controlled
   on metoprolol.  Periodically going into Afib in unit.
   - give 5mg metoprolol IV push now
   - discontinue 5mg IV Q6H metoprolol and start home regimen of 25mg PO
   TID (if unsuccessful at controlling rate, consider esmolol or
   diltiazem)
   - continue warfarin for anticoagulation (goal INR [**1-20**]).
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   -          discontinue heparin (patient has been in therapeutic INR
   range of [**1-20**] for 24 hours)
   -          hold coumadin today (INR today was 4.8). No need to reverse
   her with vitamin K if not bleeding.
   4.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   5.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   6.       Hypertension
   - continue home metoprolol 25mg TID
   7.       Anemia
  MCV is 107, however B12 and Folate levels were above
   reference range.  Possible cause of anemia is hypothyroidism.
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   8.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   9.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   10.    Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   11.    Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   12.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP). ABGs show respiratory acidosis without
   adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now increased to 30.
   Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA, developing CHF,
   infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and echo was normal.
   - decrease IV lasix to 4mg/hr or goal -1L for today given her elevated
   BNP and edema
   - transition to bolus lasix
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures from yesterday
   - repeat sputum cultures today given productive cough
   - CXR today given productive cough
   2.       Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of Afib controlled
   on metoprolol.  Periodically going into Afib in unit.
   - give 5mg metoprolol IV push now
   - discontinue 5mg IV Q6H metoprolol and start home regimen of 25mg PO
   TID (if unsuccessful at controlling rate, consider esmolol or
   diltiazem)
   - continue warfarin for anticoagulation (goal INR [**1-20**]).
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE
   -          discontinue heparin (patient has been in therapeutic INR
   range of [**1-20**] for 24 hours)
   -          hold coumadin today (INR today was 4.8). No need to reverse
   her with vitamin K if not bleeding.
   4.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   5.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   6.       Hypertension
   - continue home metoprolol 25mg TID
   7.       Anemia
  MCV is 107, however B12 and Folate levels were above
   reference range.  Possible cause of anemia is hypothyroidism.
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   8.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   9.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   10.    Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   11.    Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   12.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old female with morbid obesity, hypothyroidism, DM, PE, COPD, and OSA. She was admitted with RLE pain and SOB and has since developed worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, PE, and obstructive lung disease. She is currently being treated with non-invasive ventilation, antibiotics, and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and hypercarbia may indicate respiratory failure, which could be due to OSA, developing CHF, or infection.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the current episode may require closer monitoring and adjustment of her anticoagulation therapy.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's history of PE and initial presentation clinically concerning for PE requires continued monitoring and treatment.
4. Obstructive Lung Disease: The patient's history of asthma and COPD may require adjustments to her medication regimen and respiratory therapy.
5. Obstructive Sleep Apnea: The patient's OSA may require continued treatment with non-invasive ventilation and adjustments to her sleep position.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to her hypothyroidism and requires continued monitoring and treatment.
7. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's CKD may be related to her DM and HTN, and requires continued monitoring and treatment.
8. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's DM requires continued monitoring and treatment with insulin and medications.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may require continued treatment with statins.
10. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism requires continued treatment with levothyroxine.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, the following potential complications can be identified:

* Respiratory failure
* Atrial fibrillation
* Pulmonary embolism
* Obstructive lung disease
* Obstructive sleep apnea
* Anemia
* Chronic kidney disease
* Type 2 diabetes mellitus
* Hyperlipidemia
* Hypothyroidism"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP). ABGs show respiratory acidosis without
   adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now increased to 30.
   Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA, developing CHF,
   infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and echo was normal.
   Pt has productive cough.
   - give 80mg PO lasix (patient responded to lasix at 40mg IV)
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation.  Place pt on NC today as
   tolerated.
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures
   - followup CXR given productive cough
   2.       Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of Afib controlled
   on metoprolol.  Periodically going into Afib in unit. Pt still
   tachycardic.
   - continue increased regimen of 37.5mg PO TID (if unsuccessful at
   controlling rate, consider esmolol or diltiazem)
   - consider adding esmolol for further rate control
   - hold warfarin today for anticoagulation (current INR 3.7, goal INR
   [**1-20**]).
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE. Pt also has Afib.
   - continue coumadin as above
   4.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   5.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   6.       Hypertension
   - metoprolol as above
   7.       Anemia
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   8.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   9.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   10.    Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   11.    Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   12.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP). ABGs show respiratory acidosis without
   adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now increased to 30.
   Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA, developing CHF,
   infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and echo was normal.
   Pt has productive cough.
   - give 80mg PO lasix (patient responded to lasix at 40mg IV)
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation.  Place pt on NC today as
   tolerated.
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures
   - followup CXR given productive cough
   2.       Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of Afib controlled
   on metoprolol.  Periodically going into Afib in unit. Pt still
   tachycardic.
   - continue increased regimen of 37.5mg PO TID (if unsuccessful at
   controlling rate, consider esmolol or diltiazem)
   - consider adding esmolol for further rate control
   - hold warfarin today for anticoagulation (current INR 3.7, goal INR
   [**1-20**]).
   3.       PE - pt with history of PE and initial presentation clinically
   concerning for PE. Pt also has Afib.
   - continue coumadin as above
   4.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   5.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   6.       Hypertension
   - metoprolol as above
   7.       Anemia
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   8.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   9.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   10.    Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID.
   11.    Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   12.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypothyroidism, and hypertension. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with symptoms of shortness of breath and right lower extremity (RLE) pain. She has been diagnosed with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and possible pulmonary embolism (PE). She has also been experiencing tachycardia and has a history of PE.

Current Status:

* Respiratory status: The patient's oxygen saturation is 90%, and her respiratory acidosis has not been adequately compensated.
* Cardiac status: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and her heart rate is 113 beats per minute.
* Hemodynamic status: The patient's blood pressure is 143/78 mmHg, and her central venous pressure is 12 mmHg.
* Renal status: The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, and her urine output is 5,570 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 12.2 K/uL, her hemoglobin level is 10.9 g/dL, and her platelet count is 283 K/uL.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient is likely to have multifactorial respiratory failure due to her obesity, OSA, and possible developing chronic heart failure. She will be given 80mg of PO lasix and titrated BIPAP settings for best ventilation.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation controlled on metoprolol. She will continue to receive 37.5mg of PO TID, and her warfarin will be held due to her current INR of 3.7.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE and is currently experiencing symptoms consistent with PE. She will continue to receive coumadin.
4. Obstructive lung disease: The patient has a history of asthma and will continue to receive advair and monteleukast.
5. OSA: The patient will continue to receive BIPAP.
6. Hypertension: The patient will continue to receive metoprolol.
7. Anemia: The patient will continue to receive home iron.
8. Chronic kidney disease: The patient will be monitored for I/Os and avoid nephrotoxins.
9. Chronic pain: The patient will continue to receive home pain meds once her respiratory status improves.
10. Type 2 DM: The patient will continue to receive home insulin and FS QID.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen due to her obesity, OSA, and possible developing chronic heart failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, and her tachycardia could increase her risk of cardiac complications.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's PE could worsen, leading to respiratory failure and cardiac complications.
4. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease could worsen, leading to acute kidney injury.
5. Infection: The patient's respiratory failure could increase her risk of developing pneumonia or other infections.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to her tissues.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism could worsen, leading to decreased metabolic rate and increased risk of cardiac complications.

Based on the patient's current status and potential medical complications, it is essential to closely monitor her respiratory, cardiac, and renal status, as well as her response to treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP). ABGs show respiratory acidosis without
   adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now increased to 30.
   Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA, developing CHF,
   infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and echo was normal.
   Pt has productive cough.
   - give 80mg PO lasix [**Hospital1 **] (patient responded to lasix at 40mg IV)
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation.  Place pt on NC today as
   tolerated.
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures
   - followup CXR given productive cough
   2.       Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of Afib controlled
   on metoprolol.  Periodically going into Afib. Pt still tachycardic.
   - increase metoprolol to 50.0mg PO TID (esmolol not appropriate because
   it is only available IV)
   - consider adding esmolol for further rate control
   - hold warfarin today for anticoagulation (current INR 3.7, goal INR
   [**1-20**]).
   3.       Altered Mental Status
 patient not at baseline mental status
   according to PCP and nurses who have cared for her previously.  Most
   likely due to delirium from hospital stay (passive variant).
   - Gentle reorientation (talking, getting her out of bed)
   4.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   5.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   6.       Hypertension
   - metoprolol as above
   7.       Anemia
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   8.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN.  Improving as evidenced by
   decreasing Cre.  Perfusion improving after fluid reduction.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   9.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   10.    Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID
   11.    Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   12.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
 65 year old female with h/o obesity, OSA, PE,
   COPD, DM, hypothyroidism, who presented with SOB and RLE pain now with
   worsening hypoxia, hypercarbia, and somnolence.
   1.       Hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure
 likely
   multifactorial given patient
s obesity (restrictive lung disease), OSA
   (noncompliance on BIPAP). ABGs show respiratory acidosis without
   adequate metabolic compensation
 although HCO3 now increased to 30.
   Possible causes of respiratory falure include: OSA, developing CHF,
   infection. Pt ruled out for MI by serial enzymes and echo was normal.
   Pt has productive cough.
   - give 80mg PO lasix [**Hospital1 **] (patient responded to lasix at 40mg IV)
   - titrate BIPAP settings for best ventilation.  Place pt on NC today as
   tolerated.
   - continue gentle ativan PRN
   - continue daily ABG via arterial line
   - followup sputum cultures
   - followup CXR given productive cough
   2.       Atrial Fibrillation
 patient has history of Afib controlled
   on metoprolol.  Periodically going into Afib. Pt still tachycardic.
   - increase metoprolol to 50.0mg PO TID (esmolol not appropriate because
   it is only available IV)
   - consider adding esmolol for further rate control
   - hold warfarin today for anticoagulation (current INR 3.7, goal INR
   [**1-20**]).
   3.       Altered Mental Status
 patient not at baseline mental status
   according to PCP and nurses who have cared for her previously.  Most
   likely due to delirium from hospital stay (passive variant).
   - Gentle reorientation (talking, getting her out of bed)
   4.       OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE
 patient has an allergist who
   reported asthma
   - continue advair, monteleukast as above
   5.       OSA
   - continue BIPAP as above
   6.       Hypertension
   - metoprolol as above
   7.       Anemia
   - continue to follow blood counts
   - continue home iron.
   8.       CKD
 likely from DM and HTN.  Improving as evidenced by
   decreasing Cre.  Perfusion improving after fluid reduction.
   - monitor I/Os
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   9.       Chronic pain
   - continue home pain meds once respiratory status improves
   10.    Type 2 DM
   - HISS while in house with DM diet, FS QID
   11.    Hyperlipidemia
   - continue home statin
   12.    Hypothyroidism
   - continue home levothyroxine

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypothyroidism, and hypertension. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with symptoms of shortness of breath (SOB) and right lower extremity (RLE) pain.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is experiencing hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely multifactorial due to her obesity, OSA, and possible developing congestive heart failure (CHF) or infection.
* Cardiac status: The patient has atrial fibrillation (Afib) that is not fully controlled despite being on metoprolol. She is still tachycardic.
* Mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, likely due to delirium from her hospital stay.
* Renal status: The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) likely due to her DM and hypertension. Her creatinine levels are improving with fluid reduction.
* Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is being monitored and managed with home iron therapy.
* Other comorbidities: The patient has a history of asthma, chronic pain, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism, which are being managed with various medications.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 12.1-12.2 K/uL
* Hct: 32.9-33.8%
* Plt: 265-283 K/uL
* Cr: 1.1-1.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 149-154 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Ca++: 8.1 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.6 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Lasix (furosemide) 40mg IV and 80mg PO
* Metoprolol 37.5mg PO TID
* Pantoprazole (Protonix) 40mg PO
* Advair and monteleukast for asthma
* Home pain meds
* Home iron therapy
* Home levothyroxine for hypothyroidism
* Statin for hyperlipidemia

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing gentle ativan PRN for sedation
* Titrating BIPAP settings for best ventilation
* Placing the patient on NC today as tolerated
* Following up with sputum cultures and CXR given productive cough
* Continuing daily ABG via arterial line
* Monitoring I/Os and avoiding nephrotoxins
* Continuing home pain meds once respiratory status improves
* Transferring to rehab with goals of stabilizing Cr levels, controlling HR and BP, controlling Afib, and promoting weight loss via diuresis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening respiratory failure
* Development of CHF or infection
* Uncontrolled Afib
* Delirium or altered mental status
* Anemia or bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Nephrotoxicity or worsening CKD
* Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy
* Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism due to medication changes
* Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis due to immobility."
