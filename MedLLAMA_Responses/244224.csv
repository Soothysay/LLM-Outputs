   masses, not fully evaluated.
   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o man with septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and high
   likelihood of new diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy.
   Respiratory failure
          It is not exactly clear what his parenchymal opacities
   represent.  He may have ARDS, community/nursing-home-acquired
   pneumonia, lymphangitic spread of tumor, or reactivation of
   tuberculosis (given right apical findings, foreign-born status,
   cachexia,
treatment-resistant
 pneumonia, and possible new relative
   immunosuppression from malignancy.
          Ventilation per ARDSnet strategy, although this is
   complicated by his emphysema.  At present, he has some dyssynchrony
   with the ventialtor and we will pursue additional sedation and try to
   match applied PEEP to instrinsic PEEP.  Remove extension tubing to
   decrease dead space.
   Pneumonia
          Although not clear that this is bacterial pneumonia, we will
   treat broadly for nursing-home-acquired pneumonia.
          Respiratory isolation and endotracheal aspirates for AFB x
   3.
   Possible malignancy
          Unable to safely bronch at present
 will check endotracheal
   aspirate for cytology
   Septic Shock
          Goal-directed therapy, but adjust CVP goal to ~15.  Use LR
   for resusctitive fluuid
          Measure noninvasive cardiac parameters with Vigileo.  If low
   CO, dobutamine
          Doesn
t meet criteria for steroids
          Would not pursue activated protein C while he is on heparin.
   Acidosis
          Mixed nongap metabolic and respiratory
 management as
   detailed above, including LR for further fluids
   Possible pulmonary embolism
          I doubt that the CT findings represent a PE as the major
   etiology of his respiratory failure.  Check LENIs and if no clot d/c
   heparin.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old man with respiratory failure and shock. The patient has a right hilar mass and possible pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography (CT) scan. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with ARDSnet settings and has been treated with antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 104 beats per minute, blood pressure of 80/57 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His respiratory rate is 33 breaths per minute, and his peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 23 cmH2O.

The patient has a history of septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and a high likelihood of new diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy. The patient's parenchymal opacities on chest radiograph are not clearly defined, but may represent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), community-acquired pneumonia, lymphangitic spread of tumor, or reactivation of tuberculosis.

The patient is receiving goal-directed therapy for septic shock, including fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution and vasopressor support with norepinephrine. He is also receiving mechanical ventilation with ARDSnet settings and is being treated for possible pneumonia with antibiotics.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a possible PE on CT scan, which could worsen his respiratory failure and increase his risk of mortality.
2. Sepsis: The patient has septic shock, which could lead to multiorgan dysfunction and increased mortality.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a possible diagnosis of pneumonia, which could worsen his respiratory failure and increase his risk of mortality.
4. Malignancy: The patient has a high likelihood of new diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy, which could worsen his respiratory failure and increase his risk of mortality.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which could worsen his respiratory status and increase his risk of mortality.

Based on the patient's condition, the following potential medical complications should be monitored closely:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient should be closely monitored for signs of worsening respiratory failure, such as increasing oxygen requirements or worsening hypoxemia.
2. Sepsis: The patient should be closely monitored for signs of worsening sepsis, such as increasing lactate levels or worsening organ dysfunction.
3. Pneumonia: The patient should be closely monitored for signs of worsening pneumonia, such as increasing cough or worsening chest radiograph findings.
4. Malignancy: The patient should be closely monitored for signs of worsening malignancy, such as increasing symptoms or worsening radiographic findings.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient should be closely monitored for signs of worsening respiratory failure, such as increasing oxygen requirements or worsening hypoxemia."

   Imaging: CTA WET READ
   4 x 5cm rt hilar neoplasm causing marked compression and possible
   invasion of
   the central rt bronchovascular bundle and complete obliteration of the
   bronchus intermedius.  Addtional small filling defect is noted within a
   rll
   segmental branch which may represent a small non occlusive emboli.
   distal
   branches not evaluated due to motion which also obscures eval of lung
   parenchyma.  there is marked pneumonia/postobstructive pneumonitis of
   portion
   of the rll and rml.  marked bronchial wall thickening and scattred
   opacities
   with interstitial thickening which are likley infectious but can not
   exclude lymphangitic spread of tumor.  small b/l effusions with lt
   compression
   atelectasis.  severe emphysema.  Thyroid nodules.  probable b/l adrenal
   masses, not fully evaluated.
   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo male w/ HTN, dementia, past prostate CA presents w/ shock and
   hypoxemic respiratory failure
   # Res Failure
   DDx: Lung collapse w/ hilar mass, post obstructive pna, non obstructive
   infection including TB, pseudomonas, MRSA, ARDS.
   Oxygenation impaired, w/ wide a-a gradient.  Co2 increasing, w/
   acidosis (but prob driven by metabolic dysfunction primarily).  Will
   work to; 1) increase sedation 2) match PEEP to auto PEEP 3) d/c
   extention tube (resistance).
   Small sub-segmental PE as well, though likely not contributing greatly
   to hypoxemia.  Will d/c heparin gtts given possibility of converting
   potential PA infiltration into endobronchial bleed.  Will check lenis.
   # SHOCK
   Likely sepsis, from post pneumonia (post vs non post obstructive).
   Lactate stable.  Cont goal directed therapy w/ broad spectrum
   antibiotics.  Increase CVP goal to 14-16 given PEEP.  W/ acidosis,
   using LR currently.  Will focus pressors on norepi + vasopressin.  Will
   also consider trial of dobutamine if decreased CO.  Will assess whether
   candidate for activated protein C; concern for intracranial bleeding w/
   unknown brain mets?
   - will also assess TTE to r/o cardiac cause of hypotension
   # ID
   Likely pulmonary source to sepsis.
   F/u culture data.
   Also concern for TB given hx of growing up in [**Country **], immunocompromise,
   granulomatous findings on Chest CT.
   -          cont empiric antibiotics w/ vanco / zosyn / levo.
   -          Gram stain sputum, if negative, will ask ID to comment on
   empiric TB treatment plaan
   -          Endotracheal aspirate for TB x 3
   # Acid / Base status
   Resp acidosis w/ non gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to
   hyperchloremic met ac from liters of NS.
   Will convert resuscitation to LR and follow panel, abgs
   # ARF
   Resolved w/ IVFs
   Cont to trend, likely was pre-renal.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dementia, and prostate cancer who presented with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure. He has a CTA scan showing a 4x5cm right hilar neoplasm causing compression and possible invasion of the central right bronchovascular bundle. He also has small filling defects in the right lower lobe segmental branches, which may represent non-occlusive emboli. He has marked pneumonia and post-obstructive pneumonitis in the right lower lobe and right middle lobe, as well as bronchial wall thickening and scattered opacities with interstitial thickening that may be infectious or lymphangitic spread of tumor.

The patient has a respiratory failure diagnosis, with a differential diagnosis including lung collapse with hilar mass, post-obstructive pneumonia, non-obstructive infection including TB, pseudomonas, MRSA, and ARDS. He has a wide A-a gradient and increasing CO2 levels, with acidosis that is likely driven by metabolic dysfunction primarily.

The patient is also diagnosed with sepsis, likely from post-pneumonia, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. He has a lactate level that is stable, and his goal-directed therapy is being focused on norepinephrine and vasopressin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further deterioration and organ failure due to sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is severe and may not respond to current treatment, leading to further deterioration and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has small filling defects in the right lower lobe segmental branches, which may represent non-occlusive emboli. This could lead to further deterioration in respiratory function and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and dementia, which may increase his risk for cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
5. Infectious Complications: The patient has a high risk of developing further infections, particularly given his immunocompromised state and the presence of a neoplasm.
6. Metabolic Complications: The patient's acidosis may lead to further metabolic complications, such as hyperkalemia or hypoglycemia, which could be life-threatening.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of dementia and prostate cancer may increase his risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation or bleeding.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of dementia and potential brain metastases may increase his risk for neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for further deterioration and potential life-threatening complications. Close monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to prevent and manage these complications."

 NO DVT

   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The number of
   aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to ventilator and sub-optimal
   echo windows. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle
   is not well seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The number of
   aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to ventilator and sub-optimal
   echo windows. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle
   is not well seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

   infection including TB, pseudomonas, MRSA, ARDS.
   Oxygenation impaired, w/ wide a-a gradient.  Co2 increasing, w/
   acidosis (but prob driven by metabolic dysfunction primarily).  Will
   work to; 1) increase sedation 2) match PEEP to auto PEEP 3) d/c
   extention tube (resistance).
   Small sub-segmental PE as well, though likely not contributing greatly
   to hypoxemia.  Will d/c heparin gtts given possibility of converting
   potential PA infiltration into endobronchial bleed.  Will check lenis.

   # SHOCK
   Likely sepsis, from post pneumonia (post vs non post obstructive).
   Lactate stable.  Cont goal directed therapy w/ broad spectrum
   antibiotics.  Increase CVP goal to 14-16 given PEEP.  W/ acidosis,
   using LR currently.  Will focus pressors on norepi + vasopressin.  Will
   also consider trial of dobutamine if decreased CO.  Will assess whether
   candidate for activated protein C; concern for intracranial bleeding w/
   unknown brain mets?
   # ID

   -          cont empiric antibiotics w/ vanco / zosyn / levo.
   -          Gram stain sputum, if negative, will ask ID to comment on
   empiric TB treatment plaan
   -          Endotracheal aspirate for TB x 3
   # Acid / Base status
   Resp acidosis w/ non gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dementia, and past prostate cancer, who presented with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with influenza B and is suspected to have lung collapse with a hilar mass, post-obstructive pneumonia, and non-obstructive infection, including TB, pseudomonas, MRSA, and ARDS.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
* Heart rate: 107 bpm (94-108 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 98/47 mmHg (64-112/71 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 30 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Cardiac rhythm: sinus tachycardia

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives. He has also been receiving respiratory support with a ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 29.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 331 x 10^9/L
* Blood urea nitrogen: 104 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 159 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.4 mmol/L
* Calcium: 6.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.6 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest computed tomography (CT) scan: showing a right hilar mass with post-obstructive atelectasis and probable post-obstructive pneumonitis, extensive thickening of interstitial tissue in both lungs, right pleural effusion, mediastinal adenopathy, bilateral adrenal masses consistent with metastases, small non-obstructive thrombus in a branch of the pulmonary artery supplying the right middle lobe, and severe emphysema and suggestion of right-sided heart failure.
* Echocardiogram: showing normal left ventricular function, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded, and no pathologic valvular abnormality.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiration failure: suspected lung collapse with a hilar mass, post-obstructive pneumonia, and non-obstructive infection, including TB, pseudomonas, MRSA, and ARDS.
* Shock: likely sepsis from post-pneumonia, with lactate stable and goal-directed therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
* Infectious disease: suspected influenza B, with likely pulmonary source to sepsis, and concern for TB given hx of growing up in a country with high TB prevalence and immunocompromise.
* Acid-base status: resp acidosis with non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis from liters of NS.
* Acute renal failure: resolved with IVFs, with cont trend, likely was pre-renal.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: worsening lung collapse, post-obstructive pneumonitis, and non-obstructive infection.
* Shock: worsening sepsis, with potential for organ dysfunction and failure.
* Infectious disease: progression of influenza B, with potential for worsening respiratory failure and sepsis, and concern for TB.
* Acid-base status: worsening resp acidosis and non-gap metabolic acidosis, with potential for worsening organ dysfunction and failure.
* Acute renal failure: potential for worsening renal dysfunction and failure.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic status, as well as ongoing antibiotic therapy and supportive care."

   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The number of
   aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to ventilator and sub-optimal
   echo windows. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle
   is not well seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male who presented with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure. He has a history of hypertension, dementia, and past prostate cancer.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 38.1°C, heart rate 107 bpm, blood pressure 98/47 mmHg, respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on 80% FiO2.
* Respiratory support: The patient is on a ventilator in CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 16 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) of 3.9 L/min, and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) of 1,542 dyne·s·cm⁻⁵.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete blood count (CBC): White blood cell count 29.0 × 10⁹/L, hemoglobin 9.9 g/dL, and platelet count 331 × 10⁹/L.
	+ Blood chemistry: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 4.8 mmol/L, and glucose 159 mg/dL.
	+ Liver function tests (LFTs): Alanine transaminase (ALT) 28 IU/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 42 IU/L, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 103 IU/L.
	+ Renal function tests: Creatinine 1.4 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 22.4 mg/dL.
* Imaging studies:
	+ Chest computed tomography (CT) scan: The patient has a right hilar mass with postobstructive atelectasis and probable postobstructive pneumonitis, as well as bilateral adrenal masses consistent with metastases.
	+ Echocardiogram: The patient has a normal left ventricular function, but a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Sepsis: The patient has a diagnosis of sepsis due to post-pneumonia (post vs non-post obstructive).
* Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure.
* Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has an elevated creatinine level and BUN.
* Acid-base status: The patient has a respiratory acidosis with a non-gap metabolic acidosis.
* Activated protein C (APC) therapy: The patient is being considered for APC therapy, but there is a concern for intracranial bleeding due to unknown brain metastases.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Respiratory support: Weaning of ventilator settings and consideration of a trial of dobutamine if decreased CO.
* Hemodynamic support: Use of norepinephrine and vasopressin to support blood pressure, and consideration of a trial of dobutamine if decreased CO.
* Antibiotics: Continuation of broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and levofloxacin.
* Stress ulcer prophylaxis: Administration of famotidine.
* Vascular access: Maintenance of central venous access and consideration of placement of an arterial line.
* Nutrition: Consideration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and glycemic control with subcutaneous insulin.
* Prophylaxis: Administration of heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
* Communication: The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment."

 NO DVT
   TTE
   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The number of
   aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to ventilator and sub-optimal
   echo windows. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle
   is not well seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo male w/ HTN, dementia, past prostate CA presents w/ shock and
   hypoxemic respiratory failure
   # Res Failure
   ** Hypoxia
   Improving oxygenation.
   Likely decreased from influenza (now showing more infiltrates in lung)
   as well as mass, post obstructive pna, etc.
   Decrease FiO2 to 60% and cont wean vent.
   Will treat w/ oseltamivir for flu.
   **? PE
   Unlikely true PE, more likely disloged from infiltrative disease into
   PA.
   Will d/c iv heparin
 sub q.
   # SHOCK
   Likely sepsis, from post pneumonia (post vs non post obstructive).
   Lactate stable.  Cont goal directed therapy w/ broad spectrum
   antibiotics.  Increase CVP goal to 14-16 given PEEP.  W/ acidosis,
   using LR currently.  Will focus pressors on norepi + vasopressin.
   Dobutamin trial w/ decreased MAP.
   - cont pressors, norepi + vasopressin
   # ID
   INFLUENAZA B
   -          Oseltamivir

   -          Per ID, no need for further TB eval.  Off precautions.
   -          - f/u vanc level
   **Post obstructive + multifocal PNA
   Cont empiric antibiotics w/ vanco / zosyn / levo.
   Cont follow cultures
   # Hilar mass
   Suspicious for malignancy.
   Will defer w/u unitl over sepsis / shock.
   # Acid / Base status
   Improved w/ LR resuscitation.
   Cont follow.
   # ARF
   Creat back up.  W/ likely ATN w/ muddy brown casts.  Will trend panel
   and keep CVP 14-16, map > 65.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 NO DVT
   TTE
   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a
   focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The number of
   aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic
   pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of
   tamponade.
   IMPRESSION: poor technical quality due to ventilator and sub-optimal
   echo windows. Left ventricular function is probably normal, a focal
   wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle
   is not well seen. No pathologic valvular abnormality seen. Pulmonary
   artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxia. He has a history of hypertension, dementia, and past prostate cancer. He presented with shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's condition has been improving, with decreasing FiO2 and weaning of the ventilator. He has been treated with oseltamivir for influenza B and antibiotics for post-pneumonia.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

* Respiratory failure: hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis
* Shock: likely sepsis from post-pneumonia, with lactate stable and goal-directed therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics
* Infectious disease: influenza B, with oseltamivir treatment and follow-up culture data
* Post-obstructive and multifocal pneumonia: with empiric antibiotics and follow-up cultures
* Hilar mass: suspicious for malignancy, with deferral of further workup until sepsis and shock are resolved
* Acid-base status: improved with LR resuscitation, with continued follow-up
* Acute kidney injury: with muddy brown casts, likely ATN, with trend panel and CVP 14-16 and MAP > 65

Potential medical complications:

* Pneumonia progression: with continued respiratory failure and potential for further decline
* Sepsis progression: with ongoing shock and potential for further organ dysfunction
* Acute kidney injury progression: with ongoing ATN and potential for further kidney damage
* Cardiac complications: with ongoing shock and potential for further cardiac dysfunction
* Malignancy progression: with continued suspicion of malignancy and potential for further spread

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor and manage the patient's respiratory failure, shock, and infectious disease
* Continue empiric antibiotics for post-pneumonia and follow-up cultures
* Consider further workup of the hilar mass, including imaging and biopsy
* Monitor and manage the patient's acid-base status and electrolyte imbalance
* Consider further management of the patient's acute kidney injury, including dialysis if necessary
* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and consider further management if necessary
* Consider further management of the patient's malignancy, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure and shock. They have a history of influenza, sputum with gram-positive cocci, and are receiving two pressors. The patient is unable to provide a medical history due to sedation and a language barrier. They have a known allergy to no drugs. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (T) 38.1°C, heart rate (HR) 108 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure (BP) 101/53 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) 100%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus tachycardia, and their central venous pressure (CVP) is 16 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show the following: white blood cell count (WBC) 29.0, hemoglobin (Hb) 9.9 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) 379, creatinine (Cr) 1.2 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 16 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show worsening bilateral infiltrates and effusions, as well as a right hilar mass.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening bilateral infiltrates and effusions suggest the possibility of ARDS.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock, bilateral infiltrates, and effusions may indicate the presence of sepsis.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's right hilar mass and worsening bilateral infiltrates and effusions may suggest the possibility of a PE.
4. Bacterial Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture shows gram-positive cocci, which may indicate bacterial pneumonia.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance data shows a significant amount of fluid intake and output, which may indicate fluid overload.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may indicate hypotension.
7. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%, but their FiO2 is 70%, which may indicate hypoxemia.
8. Cardiac Compromise: The patient's sinus tachycardia and decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) may indicate cardiac compromise.
9. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy and the presence of a right hilar mass may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Infection: The patient's septic shock and bilateral infiltrates and effusions may indicate the presence of an infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old man admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and shock. He has a diagnosis of septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and is at high risk of developing a new diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 0.7 and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. He is receiving two pressors, dobutamine and norepinephrine, and is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.6°F)
* Heart rate: 108 bpm
* Blood pressure: 101/53 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 30 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%
* Central venous pressure: 16 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 29.0 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 379 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 104 mg/dL
* Sodium: 135 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.8 mmol/L
* Chloride: 16 mEq/L
* Calcium: 6.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.6 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.4 mmol/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: worsening bibasilar infiltrates and effusions, with a right hilar mass
* Computed tomography (CT) scan: negative for pulmonary embolism

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to influenza, possibly with bacterial superinfection. He is at risk of developing further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is likely secondary to his underlying infections, including pneumonia and possibly a pulmonary embolism. He is at risk of developing further complications, such as organ failure or death.
3. Malignancy: The patient's high likelihood of developing a new diagnosis of pulmonary malignancy is a significant concern. He is at risk of developing further complications, such as metastases or recurrence.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's negative CT scan and re-read of the CT scan do not rule out the possibility of a pulmonary embolism. He is at risk of developing further complications, such as pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular failure.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, including his emphysema and hypertension, puts him at risk of developing further cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and inability to provide a history put him at risk of developing further neurological complications, such as delirium or seizures.
7. Infection: The patient's underlying infections, including pneumonia and possibly a pulmonary embolism, put him at risk of developing further infections, such as sepsis or meningitis.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's underlying gastrointestinal disease, including his emphysema and hypertension, puts him at risk of developing further gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation."
