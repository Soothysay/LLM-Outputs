   Chief Complaint: Sepsis/Hypotension
   24 Hour Events:
   -Hct 49.4 in PM
   -Still requiring small doses of Neo in PM.
   -Got femoral line and post-pyloric tube in IR
   -Renal recs: no CVVH for now, give bicarb to correct acidosis
   -Contact[**Name (NI) **] ERCP attending [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9526**] (cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9527**]) at
   [**Hospital1 966**] to update, he felt procedure was clean and was wondering about a
   recurrent HD line infection.
   -Surgery recs serial LFTs, pancreatic enzymes and ongoing fluid
   resusciation
   -Aggressive hydration for severe pancreatitis.  Got 4 liters LR, then
   3amps of Bicarb in 1L D5W, then another 3 liters NS. 7+ liter POS by
   midnight.
   --Started Meropenem in place of Zosyn in AM.  Grew GNRs in blood
   cultures from [**Hospital1 1504**] 2/2 bottles.  Started on Gentamycin and
   Linezolid, d/c'd Vancomycin.
   -Hyperglycemic in PM to ~300, sliding scale added

   Assessment and Plan
   49F with SLE on chronic steroids, ESRD on HD, ERCP earlier today for
   choledocholithiasis, who presented with sepsis and pancreatitis.
   .
   #. Sepsis - probable biliary source but DDX includes line infection.
   Has h/o multidrug resistant organisms at [**Hospital1 966**].
   -- f/u blood cultures (and those from [**Hospital1 1504**] ER)
   -- continue meropenem/getamicin/linezolid for broad coverage
   -- prn fluid for CVP goal [**9-25**], will check femoral line CVP, will also
   check delta pulse pressure
   -- wean vasopressors for MAP > 65
   -- continue stress dose steroids for now
   -- f/u ERCP c/s recs
   -- f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] c/s recs
   -- will get echo to assess heart function with all these fluids, check
   OSH records for any previous TTe
   .
   #. Resp Failure - Was intubated for airway protection, never dropped
   saturations or demonstrated problems with oxygenation. She has evidence
   of volume overload on CXR, will need aggressive IVF for sepsis and
   pancreatitis management, so this will be a barrier to extubation in the
   future.
   -- wean FiO2 as tolerated, keep on AC for now
   -- ultimately, volume management will be via HD/CVVH
   -- send sputum cultures
   -- fent/midaz for sedation
   .
   #. Pancreatitis s/p ERCP - no evidence of persistent obstruction or
   free air on CT scan. However, pancreatic enzymes are elevated, and HCT
   acutely elevated c/w pancreatitis.
   -- aggressive IVF
   -- NPO with bowel rest for now
   -- pain control with IV fentanyl
   -- trend LFTs and panc enzymes daily
   -- ERCP to follow
   .
   #. ESRD
   -- should be dialyzed today, will touch base with renal team
   -- can likely do hemodialysis but if BP drops, may need CVVH
   -- renally dose all medications
   .
   #. SLE
   -- currently on stress dose steroids, replacing her home dose
   -- continue Plaquenil 200mg daily
   -- continue Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis
   .
   # h/o PE - on despite ESRD [**3-18**] ""coumadin resistence""
   -- holding lovenox for now, will clarify coagulation needs by getting
   OSH records
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now given pancreatitis, but prefer early intiation
   of TF's via OGT when possible, will obtain nutrition c/s

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 49-year-old female with SLE, ESRD on HD, and a history of multidrug-resistant organisms, presented to the ER with sepsis and pancreatitis. She underwent ERCP for choledocholithiasis and was intubated for airway protection. The patient is currently receiving meropenem, gentamicin, and linezolid for broad coverage, and her blood cultures are pending.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F)
* Heart rate: 82 bpm
* Blood pressure: 111/78 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 100%
* White blood cell count: 21.4 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 12.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 136 x 10^9/L

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated pancreatic enzymes (198 mg/dL)
* Elevated lipase (66 IU/L)
* Elevated troponin-T (0.45 ng/mL)
* Elevated lactic acid (2.0 mmol/L)
* Elevated LDH (217 IU/L)
* Elevated creatinine (6.6 mg/dL)
* Elevated potassium (5.5 mmol/L)
* Elevated phosphorus (6.1 mg/dL)

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Cushingoid appearance
* Injected conjunctiva and chemosis
* Regular tachycardia
* Coarse breath sounds
* Obese and surgically scarred abdomen
* Cool extremities with no edema

The patient's plan includes:

* Continued meropenem, gentamicin, and linezolid for broad coverage
* Aggressive IVF for sepsis and pancreatitis management
* Weaning vasopressors for MAP > 65
* Stress dose steroids for now
* F/u ERCP c/s recs
* F/u [**Initials (NamePattern4)**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4)**] c/s recs
* Echo to assess heart function with all these fluids
* OSH records for any previous TTe

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis with septic shock
* Pancreatitis with organ failure
* Respiratory failure with prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Cardiovascular instability with hypotension and arrhythmias
* Renal failure with acute kidney injury
* Electrolyte imbalances with hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia
* Hemorrhagic complications with coagulopathy
* Infections with multidrug-resistant organisms

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these complications and optimize her clinical outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   49F with SLE on chronic steroids, ESRD on HD, ERCP earlier today for
   choledocholithiasis, who presented with sepsis and pancreatitis.
   .
   #. Sepsis - probable biliary source but DDX includes line infection.
   Has h/o multidrug resistant organisms at [**Hospital1 966**].
   -- f/u blood cultures (and those from [**Hospital1 1504**] ER)
   -- continue vanc/zosyn for broad coverage
   -- prn fluid for CVP goal [**9-25**]
   -- continue vasopressors for MAP > 65
   -- check central venous sat, maintain at goal >70%
   -- continue stress dose steroids for now
   -- f/u ERCP c/s recs
   -- f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] c/s recs
   .
   #. Resp Failure - Was intubated for airway protection, never dropped
   saturations or demonstrated problems with oxygenation. She has evidence
   of volume overload on CXR, will need aggressive IVF for sepsis and
   pancreatitis management, so this will be a barrier to extubation in the
   future.
   -- wean FiO2 as tolerated, keep on AC for now
   -- place a-line for oxygenation and BP monitoring
   -- ultimately, volume management will be via HD/CVVH
   -- send sputum cultures
   -- fent/midaz for sedation
   .
   #. Pancreatitis s/p ERCP - no evidence of persistent obstruction or
   free air on CT scan. However, pancreatic enzymes are elevated, and HCT
   acutely elevated c/w pancreatitis.
   -- aggressive IVF
   -- NPO with bowel rest for now
   -- pain control with IV fentanyl
   -- trend LFTs and panc enzymes daily
   -- ERCP to follow
   .
   #. ESRD
   -- renal c/s in AM, may need CVVH with tenous BPs
   -- renally dose all medications
   .
   #. SLE
   -- currently on stress dose steroids, replacing her home dose
   -- continue Plaquenil 200mg daily
   -- continue Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis
   .
   # h/o PE - on despite ESRD [**3-18**] ""coumadin resistence""

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of SLE, ESRD on HD, and ERCP for choledocholithiasis, who presented with sepsis and pancreatitis.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Sepsis: The patient has a probable biliary source of sepsis, but the differential diagnosis includes line infection. Blood cultures are pending, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.
* Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection, and her respiratory status is stable. However, she has evidence of volume overload on CXR, which may make extubation challenging in the future.
* Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis s/p ERCP, with elevated pancreatic enzymes and HCT. She is receiving aggressive IVF and bowel rest.
* ESRD: The patient has ESRD on HD, and her renal function is being closely monitored.
* SLE: The patient is on stress dose steroids, and her SLE is being managed with Plaquenil and Bactrim SS.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis progression: The patient's sepsis may worsen if the source is not identified and treated promptly.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if she develops further volume overload or if her lungs become infected.
* Pancreatitis complications: The patient may develop complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess, or fistula.
* ESRD complications: The patient may experience complications related to her ESRD, such as hypertension, anemia, or electrolyte imbalances.
* SLE flares: The patient may experience a flare of her SLE, which can lead to a range of complications, including joint pain, rash, and nephritis.

The patient's ongoing treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for sepsis
* Aggressive IVF for pancreatitis and sepsis management
* NPO with bowel rest for pancreatitis
* Pain control with IV fentanyl
* Trend LFTs and panc enzymes daily
* ERCP to follow
* Renal c/s in AM, may need CVVH with tenous BPs
* Renally dose all medications
* Continue Plaquenil 200mg daily
* Continue Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis
* Holding lovenox for now given? need for procedures

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: NPO for now given pancreatitis, but prefer early initiation of TF's via OGT when possible
* Glycemic Control: Sliding scale insulin
* Lines: Dialysis catheter, arterial line, and multi-lumen catheter
* Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with lovenox and pneumoboots
* Stress ulcer prophylaxis: VAP prophylaxis
* Comments: Bowel regimen colace/senna

The patient's code status is DNR, and her disposition is ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
   49-year-old woman with septic shock and respiratory failure in the
   setting of a very complex prior medical history (lupus, ESRD, vascular
   stents, etc.) and recent instrumentation of biliary tract.
   Septic shock
          Growing GNR in blood cultures at the [**Hospital1 1504**]
          This puts biliary-related disease higher on the
   differential, although GNRs can also be line pathogens.  Will d/w ERCP.
          Based on prior culture data, she is on linezolid,
   gentamicin, and meropenem while awaiting current culture data
          She has had good response to volume resuscitation, coming
   off of one pressor
          On stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use
          Will transducer femoral CVP and assess pulse pressure
   variation to guide further volume repletion
   Pancreatitis
   Appreciate surgery and ERCP
s help
   Will hold off on tube feeds for today while still on pressor
   Enzymes downtrending
   Respiratory failure, acute
   Continue present support during shock state
   Keep sedation as light as feasible
   Daily SBTs per protocol
   End Stage Renal Disease
   Trial of HD (or CVVHD) per renal
   Will have to consider CVVH as an interim intervention
   SLE
   On plaquenil and steroids
   Bactrim prophylaxis
   Thrombophilia
   Unclear at present what her history is
 reported history of PE and
coumadin resistance
 certainly raises the possibility of
   antiphospholipid syndrome.  Apparently on enoxaparin as outpatient but
   in obese patient on dialysis not completely clear to me about whether
   this represents therapeutic or prophylactic dosing.  Will try to get
   old records today; if unable then will therapeutically anticoagulate
   with heparin
   Complex vascular access
   Multiple upper great vein stents
 femoral line placed by
   interventional radiology under fluoro guidance
   Will also discuss possible transfer to her usual site of care ([**Hospital1 966**]) if
   beds available.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   49-year-old woman with septic shock and respiratory failure in the
   setting of a very complex prior medical history (lupus, ESRD, vascular
   stents, etc.) and recent instrumentation of biliary tract.
   Septic shock
          Growing GNR in blood cultures at the [**Hospital1 1504**]
          This puts biliary-related disease higher on the
   differential, although GNRs can also be line pathogens.  Will d/w ERCP.
          Based on prior culture data, she is on linezolid,
   gentamicin, and meropenem while awaiting current culture data
          She has had good response to volume resuscitation, coming
   off of one pressor
          On stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use
          Will transducer femoral CVP and assess pulse pressure
   variation to guide further volume repletion
   Pancreatitis
   Appreciate surgery and ERCP
s help
   Will hold off on tube feeds for today while still on pressor
   Enzymes downtrending
   Respiratory failure, acute
   Continue present support during shock state
   Keep sedation as light as feasible
   Daily SBTs per protocol
   End Stage Renal Disease
   Trial of HD (or CVVHD) per renal
   Will have to consider CVVH as an interim intervention
   SLE
   On plaquenil and steroids
   Bactrim prophylaxis
   Thrombophilia
   Unclear at present what her history is
 reported history of PE and
coumadin resistance
 certainly raises the possibility of
   antiphospholipid syndrome.  Apparently on enoxaparin as outpatient but
   in obese patient on dialysis not completely clear to me about whether
   this represents therapeutic or prophylactic dosing.  Will try to get
   old records today; if unable then will therapeutically anticoagulate
   with heparin
   Complex vascular access
   Multiple upper great vein stents
 femoral line placed by
   interventional radiology under fluoro guidance
   Will also discuss possible transfer to her usual site of care ([**Hospital1 966**]) if
   beds available.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a septic shock patient with respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, and blood pressure of 103/70 mmHg.

The patient has chronic renal failure, pancreatitis, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and troponin-T levels, indicating ongoing inflammation and tissue damage.

The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line, multi-lumen catheter, and dialysis catheter. The patient is receiving antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, and linezolid.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 360 mL and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygenation is adequate, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 350.

The patient's nutritional support includes total parenteral nutrition, and glycemic control is being maintained with insulin therapy. The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia, and prophylactic measures are being taken to prevent these complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Progressive sepsis and septic shock, leading to multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure, requiring further escalation of respiratory support.
3. Renal failure, requiring further dialysis support.
4. Pancreatitis, potentially leading to further complications such as abscess formation or pancreatic necrosis.
5. Cardiovascular instability, potentially leading to cardiac arrest.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding, potentially due to stress ulcers or anticoagulation therapy.
7. Deep vein thrombosis, potentially leading to pulmonary embolism.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia, potentially leading to further respiratory failure and sepsis.
9. Hypoglycemia, potentially due to insulin therapy.
10. Electrolyte imbalances, potentially due to fluid and electrolyte management.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy accordingly to prevent these complications and optimize outcomes."

   #. Sepsis - probable biliary source but DDX includes line infection.
   Has h/o multidrug resistant organisms at [**Hospital1 966**] in the past.
   -- f/u blood cultures (and those from [**Hospital1 1504**] ER)
   -- continue meropenem/gentamicin/linezolid for broad coverage
   -- CVP on femoral line have been in the 20

   #. Resp Failure - Was intubated for airway protection, never dropped
   saturations or demonstrated problems with oxygenation. She had evidence
   of volume overload on CXR, and received aggressive IVF for sepsis and
   pancreatitis management, so this will be a barrier to extubation in the
   future.
   -- wean FiO2 as tolerated, keep on AC for now for transfer
   -- ultimately, volume management with dialysis
   -- fent/midaz for sedation
   -- RSBI favorable today for extubation, will defer until after transfer
   .
   #. Pancreatitis s/p ERCP - no evidence of persistent obstruction or
   free air on CT scan. However, pancreatic enzymes are now within normal
   limit, has been downtrending.
   -- aggressive IVF
   -- NPO with bowel rest for now, may start tube feeds today or tomorrow
   per surgery recs
   -- pain control with IV fentanyl
   -- trend LFTs and panc enzymes daily
   -- ERCP to follow
   .
   #. ESRD
   -- had CVVHD yesterday with good effect and K now within normal limits
   -- renally dose all medications
   .
   #. SLE
   -- currently on stress dose steroids, replacing her home dose
   -- continue Plaquenil 200mg daily
   -- continue Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis
   .
   # h/o PE - on Lovenox as an outpatient, was started on heparin gtt
   yesterday for h/o antiphospholipid antibody syndrome

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of SLE, ESRD on HD, and antiphospholipid syndrome. She presented to the hospital with sepsis and pancreatitis, and was intubated for airway protection. She has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and sedatives.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 107/65 mmHg. Her respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 98%.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of pancreatitis, with elevated lipase and amylase levels. Her blood cultures are pending, but a preliminary Gram stain of her respiratory secretions showed no microorganisms.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Sepsis management: The patient will continue to receive meropenem, gentamicin, and linezolid for broad coverage. Her vasopressors will be weaned as her mean arterial pressure (MAP) increases.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient will be weaned off the ventilator once her FiO2 is reduced and her respiratory system is stable.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient will continue to receive aggressive IV fluid management, and will be started on tube feeds once her pancreatitis has resolved.
4. ESRD: The patient will continue to receive CVVHD, and her medications will be renally dosed.
5. SLE: The patient will continue to receive stress dose steroids, and will be started on Plaquenil 200mg daily.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Line infection: The patient's line infection is a potential complication that needs to be monitored closely.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a potential complication that needs to be managed closely.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is a potential complication that needs to be managed closely.
4. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is a potential complication that needs to be managed closely.
5. ESRD: The patient's ESRD is a potential complication that needs to be managed closely.

In conclusion, the patient's progress note highlights the importance of close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   49F with SLE on chronic steroids, ESRD on HD, ERCP earlier today for
   choledocholithiasis, who presented with sepsis and pancreatitis.
   .
   #. Sepsis - probable biliary source but DDX includes line infection.
   Has h/o multidrug resistant organisms at [**Hospital1 966**].
   -- f/u blood cultures (and those from [**Hospital1 1504**] ER)
   -- continue meropenem/getamicin/linezolid for broad coverage
   -- prn fluid for CVP goal [**9-25**], will check femoral line CVP, will also
   check delta pulse pressure
   -- wean vasopressors for MAP > 65
   -- continue stress dose steroids for now
   -- f/u ERCP c/s recs
   -- f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] c/s recs
   -- will get echo to assess heart function with all these fluids, check
   OSH records for any previous TTe
   .
   #. Resp Failure - Was intubated for airway protection, never dropped
   saturations or demonstrated problems with oxygenation. She has evidence
   of volume overload on CXR, will need aggressive IVF for sepsis and
   pancreatitis management, so this will be a barrier to extubation in the
   future.
   -- wean FiO2 as tolerated, keep on AC for now
   -- ultimately, volume management will be via HD/CVVH
   -- send sputum cultures
   -- fent/midaz for sedation
   .
   #. Pancreatitis s/p ERCP - no evidence of persistent obstruction or
   free air on CT scan. However, pancreatic enzymes are elevated, and HCT
   acutely elevated c/w pancreatitis.
   -- aggressive IVF
   -- NPO with bowel rest for now
   -- pain control with IV fentanyl
   -- trend LFTs and panc enzymes daily
   -- ERCP to follow
   .
   #. ESRD
   -- should be dialyzed today, will touch base with renal team
   -- can likely do hemodialysis but if BP drops, may need CVVH
   -- renally dose all medications
   .
   #. SLE
   -- currently on stress dose steroids, replacing her home dose
   -- continue Plaquenil 200mg daily
   -- continue Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis
   .
   # h/o PE - on despite ESRD [**3-18**] ""coumadin resistence""
   -- holding lovenox for now, will clarify coagulation needs by getting
   OSH records
   ICU Care

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and chronic steroid use. She was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with sepsis and pancreatitis following an ERCP procedure for choledocholithiasis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 24 mmHg, and her mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 65 mmHg. She is receiving norepinephrine and fentanyl infusions to support her blood pressure and sedation.
* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on 40% FiO2.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 8.3, and her platelet count (PLT) is 110. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, and her pancreatic enzymes are also elevated.
* Imaging studies: The patient's computed tomography (CT) scan did not show evidence of persistent obstruction or free air.
* Other medical conditions: The patient has a history of multidrug-resistant organisms and has been prescribed meropenem, gentamicin, and linezolid for broad coverage.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
* Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may progress, leading to further organ dysfunction and complications.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to decreased oxygenation and increased risk of respiratory arrest.
* Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hemodynamic instability may worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output and increased risk of cardiac arrest.
* Renal failure: The patient's ESRD may worsen, leading to further impairment of her renal function.
* Coagulopathy: The patient's history of coumadin resistance and her current use of heparin may increase her risk of bleeding complications.
* Infection: The patient's use of broad-spectrum antibiotics may increase her risk of infection with multidrug-resistant organisms.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Sepsis: Continue meropenem, gentamicin, and linezolid for broad coverage, and monitor for signs of sepsis.
* Pancreatitis: Continue aggressive IV fluids, NPO with bowel rest, and pain control with IV fentanyl.
* Respiratory failure: Wean FiO2 as tolerated, keep on AC for now, and monitor for signs of respiratory failure.
* Hemodynamic instability: Wean vasopressors for MAP > 65, and monitor for signs of hemodynamic instability.
* Renal failure: Continue hemodialysis, and monitor for signs of worsening renal function.
* Coagulopathy: Hold lovenox for now, and clarify coagulation needs by getting OSH records.
* Infection: Monitor for signs of infection, and continue broad-spectrum antibiotics as necessary.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: NPO for now given pancreatitis, but prefer early initiation of TF's via OGT when possible.
* Glycemic control: Added ISS.
* Lines: Dialysis catheter, arterial line, and multi-lumen line.
* Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with heparin and pneumoboots, and stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole.
* Comments: Bowel regimen with colace and senna."

   Assessment and Plan
   49F with SLE on chronic steroids, ESRD on HD, ERCP earlier today for
   choledocholithiasis, who presented with sepsis and pancreatitis.
   .
   #. Sepsis - probable biliary source but DDX includes line infection.
   Has h/o multidrug resistant organisms at [**Hospital1 966**] in the past.
   -- f/u blood cultures (and those from [**Hospital1 1504**] ER)
   -- continue meropenem/gentamicin/linezolid for broad coverage
   -- CVP on femoral line have been in the 20
s so likely can continue to
   back off on fluids
   -- wean vasopressors for MAP > 65
   -- continue stress dose steroids for now
   -- f/u ERCP c/s recs
   -- f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] c/s recs
   -- will get echo to assess heart function with all these fluids
   .
   #. Resp Failure - Was intubated for airway protection, never dropped
   saturations or demonstrated problems with oxygenation. She had evidence
   of volume overload on CXR, will need aggressive IVF for sepsis and
   pancreatitis management, so this will be a barrier to extubation in the
   future.
   -- wean FiO2 as tolerated, keep on AC for now
   -- ultimately, volume management with dialysis
   -- fent/midaz for sedation
   .
   #. Pancreatitis s/p ERCP - no evidence of persistent obstruction or
   free air on CT scan. However, pancreatic enzymes are elevated c/w
   pancreatitis, has been downtrending.
   -- aggressive IVF
   -- NPO with bowel rest for now
   -- pain control with IV fentanyl
   -- trend LFTs and panc enzymes daily
   -- ERCP to follow
   .
   #. ESRD
   -- had CVVH yesterday with good effect
   -- renally dose all medications
   .
   #. SLE
   -- currently on stress dose steroids, replacing her home dose
   -- continue Plaquenil 200mg daily
   -- continue Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis
   .
   # h/o PE - on Lovenox as an outpatient, was started on heparin gtt
   yesterday for h/o antiphospholipid antibody syndrome
   -- continue heparin gtt
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now given pancreatitis, but prefer early intiation
   of TF's via OGT when possible, will obtain nutrition c/s

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE: [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] Resident Progress Note
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - off neosynephrine, only on levophed
   - checking daily LFTs and amylase/lipase as is s/p ERCP
   - Echo results [**8-22**] showed hyperdynamic LV, EF >75%, mild LVH, no
   focal wall motion abnormality
   - CVP was 22 based on femoral line
   - [**Hospital1 966**] accepted her for transfer
   - Got CVVH in preparation for transfer and for afternoon K of 6.1,
   decreased to 4.9 after CVVH
   - [**Hospital1 966**] decided they don't have space for her until [**1-10**],  but they did
   tell us that she has antiphospholipid sydrome and she was started on
   heparin gtt

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. She presented to the emergency room with sepsis and pancreatitis following an ERCP procedure for choledocholithiasis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.5°C, HR 75 bpm, BP 107/65 mmHg, RR 19 breaths/min, SpO2 98%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 24 mmHg, MAP 65 mmHg
* Fluid balance: Total in 3,877 mL, total out 1,026 mL, with a positive balance of 2,851 mL
* Respiratory support: Intubated and ventilated with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 40%
* Laboratory results: WBC 8.3-8.4 K/μL, Hct 41.5-41.7%, Plt 110-105 K/μL, Cr 6.5-6.7 mg/dL, TCO2 22-23 mmHg, Glucose 198-144 mg/dL
* Imaging studies: CT scan shows no evidence of persistent obstruction or free air
* Medications: Meropenem, gentamicin, linezolid, heparin, fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and stress dose steroids

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood cultures are pending, but she has a history of multidrug-resistant organisms and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and ventilated, and her respiratory status may deteriorate further if she develops pneumonia or other complications.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatic enzymes are elevated, and she may require continued aggressive fluid management and bowel rest.
4. ESRD: The patient's kidney function is compromised, and she may require continued hemodialysis and close monitoring of her electrolyte levels.
5. SLE: The patient's SLE is currently active, and she may require continued stress dose steroids and close monitoring of her disease activity.
6. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome: The patient has a history of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and is currently receiving heparin therapy to prevent thrombotic complications.
7. DVT/PE: The patient is at risk for developing DVT/PE due to her ESRD and SLE.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infection due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of central lines and other invasive devices.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis
2. Wean vasopressors for MAP > 65
3. Continue stress dose steroids for SLE
4. Monitor pancreatic enzymes and adjust fluid management accordingly
5. Continue hemodialysis and close monitoring of electrolyte levels
6. Monitor for signs of DVT/PE and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary
7. Continue prophylaxis for stress ulcer and VAP
8. Monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   49-year-old woman with septic shock and respiratory failure in the
   setting of a very complex prior medical history (lupus, ESRD, vascular
   stents, etc.) and recent instrumentation of biliary tract.
   Septic shock
          Growing GNR in blood cultures at the [**Hospital1 1504**]; speciation
   pending.
          This puts biliary-related disease higher on the
   differential, although GNRs can also be line pathogens.
          Based on prior culture data, she is on linezolid,
   gentamicin, and meropenem while awaiting current culture data.  Gent
   level today was 1.5; got re-dosed.
          She has had good response to volume resuscitation, coming
   off of one pressor.  Femoral CVP and low stroke-volume variation (based
   on pulse contour analysis) suggests that she is adequately volume
   replete.
          On stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use
   Pancreatitis
   Appreciate surgery and ERCP
s help
   [**Month (only) 11**] be reasonable to begin post-pyloric feeding today or tomorrow.
   Enzymes downtrending
   Respiratory failure, acute
   Continue present support during shock state
   Keep sedation as light as feasible
   RSBI today suggests she might tolerate an SBT, but given planned
   transfer will defer to [**Hospital1 966**]
   End Stage Renal Disease
   After resolution of shock state, will likely need volume removal.
   HD or CVVHD per renal.  No acute indication right now.
   SLE
   On plaquenil and steroids
   Bactrim prophylaxis
   Antiphospholipid syndrome
   By report.  Now on heparin gtt.
   Complex vascular access
   Multiple upper great vein stents
 femoral line placed by
   interventional radiology under fluoro guidance
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: potential enteral feeding today or tomorrow

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   49-year-old woman with septic shock and respiratory failure in the
   setting of a very complex prior medical history (lupus, ESRD, vascular
   stents, etc.) and recent instrumentation of biliary tract.
   Septic shock
          Growing GNR in blood cultures at the [**Hospital1 1504**]; speciation
   pending.
          This puts biliary-related disease higher on the
   differential, although GNRs can also be line pathogens.
          Based on prior culture data, she is on linezolid,
   gentamicin, and meropenem while awaiting current culture data.  Gent
   level today was 1.5; got re-dosed.
          She has had good response to volume resuscitation, coming
   off of one pressor.  Femoral CVP and low stroke-volume variation (based
   on pulse contour analysis) suggests that she is adequately volume
   replete.
          On stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use
   Pancreatitis
   Appreciate surgery and ERCP
s help
   [**Month (only) 11**] be reasonable to begin post-pyloric feeding today or tomorrow.
   Enzymes downtrending
   Respiratory failure, acute
   Continue present support during shock state
   Keep sedation as light as feasible
   RSBI today suggests she might tolerate an SBT, but given planned
   transfer will defer to [**Hospital1 966**]
   End Stage Renal Disease
   After resolution of shock state, will likely need volume removal.
   HD or CVVHD per renal.  No acute indication right now.

   On plaquenil and steroids
   Bactrim prophylaxis
   Antiphospholipid syndrome
   By report.  Now on heparin gtt.
   Complex vascular access
   Multiple upper great vein stents

Summary:

The patient is a 49-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with septic shock and respiratory failure. She has a complex medical history, including lupus, end-stage renal disease, and multiple vascular stents. She has been receiving antibiotics, including linezolid, gentamicin, and meropenem, and has had good response to volume resuscitation. Her femoral central venous pressure (CVP) and low stroke-volume variation suggest she is adequately volume replete. She is receiving stress dose steroids for chronic steroid use and has had pancreatitis. She is also on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and growing Gram-negative rods (GNR) in blood cultures put her at risk for further complications, including organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires ongoing mechanical ventilation, and she may require non-invasive ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) if her condition deteriorates.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen, leading to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, abscess, or sepsis.
4. End-stage renal disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen, requiring dialysis or hemofiltration.
5. SLE: The patient's lupus may flare, leading to complications such as kidney failure, cerebral vasculitis, or pleuritis.
6. Antiphospholipid syndrome: The patient's antiphospholipid syndrome may cause complications such as stroke, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolism.
7. Vascular access complications: The patient's complex vascular access may lead to complications such as bleeding, thrombosis, or infection.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's pancreatitis and antibiotics may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
10. Cardiac complications: The patient's septic shock and chronic kidney disease may increase her risk of cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or heart failure."
