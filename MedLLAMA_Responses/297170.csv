   # Chest pain: Patient did have one episode of chest pain in the ED,
   though now is pain-free. EKG does have symmetric T wave inversions,
   though difficult to assess given lack of baseline EKG and fact that
   prior EKG was paced. T wave inversions could reflect intracranial

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a subdural hemorrhage, acute on chronic, and presenting with right hand numbness, which has resolved. She has a history of hypertension, prior TIA, and other medical conditions.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate 61 bpm, blood pressure 127/59 mmHg, respiratory rate 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97% on nasal cannula.
* Neurological status: The patient responds to stimuli, but her movement, tone, and peripheral vascular status are not assessed due to her condition.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 6.9, Hct 29.2, Plt 212
	+ Blood chemistry: Glucose 135, Troponin-T 0.09, CK 87, CKMB 4, Ca++ 8.6 mg/dL, Mg++ 2.2 mg/dL, PO4 3.0 mg/dL
	+ Coagulation studies: INR 1.5, PT 17.0, PTT 27.9
* Imaging studies: A small area of acute hemorrhage in chronic-appearing subdural per imaging, no residual deficits on exam.
* Medications:
	+ Vitamin K 10 mg PO once
	+ Dilantin load 1000 mg, then 100 mg TID
	+ Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for GERD
	+ Fosamax hold, will resume when clinically stable

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued bleeding from the subdural hemorrhage, which may require further intervention.
2. Development of intracranial hypertension, which may lead to increased ICP and potential brain herniation.
3. Cardiovascular complications, such as ischemia or infarction, given the elevated troponin levels and potential for cardiac damage.
4. Infection, particularly given the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of a pacemaker.
5. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, due to the patient's chronic lung disease.
6. Gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, due to the patient's history of GERD and the use of PPI.
7. Hematological complications, such as anemia or bleeding, due to the patient's chronic anemia and the use of anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently on NPO status. The patient's daughter is her healthcare proxy, and communication with the patient and family is ongoing."

   87 y/o woman with hypertension, prior [**Month/Day (4) **] admitted with right hand
   numbness in setting of subdural hemorrhage.
   87 yr old  with sx of hand numbness and ? expressive aphasia, resolved.
   Likely [**Month/Day (4) **]. Confounded SDH on CT of unknown onset.
   #. Subdural hemorrhage: Small area of acute hemorrhage in
   chronic-appearing subdural per imaging. No residual deficits per exam
   on arrival to MICU.
   - Hold all anticoagulation
   - INR goal 1 (1.4 per neuron), check q4h.  On 5^th unit FFP.
   - vitamin K 10 mg PO X 1 to reverse INR
   - Q2h neuro checks
   - Appreciate Neurosurgery and Neurology input
   - dilantin load tonight (1000 mg) then 100 mg TID per NSG recs
   - HOB elevated
   - repeat head CT this am
   - SSI for euglycemia
   # Chest pain: Patient did have one episode of chest pain in the ED,
   though now is pain-free. EKG does have symmetric T wave inversions,
   though difficult to assess given lack of baseline EKG and fact that
   prior EKG was paced. T wave inversions could reflect intracranial
   pathology though certainly ischemia should be ruled out.
   - monitor closely
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - serial EKGs
   - ECHO in the AM to assess wall motion
   - obtain old EKG from [**Hospital1 **] ED or PCP in AM
   - No ASA due to SDH
   - No BB currently due to relative hypotension
   # ? [**Name2 (NI) **]: Neurology consultant believes symptoms compatible with lacunar
   infarct, will be difficult to see on CT. Cannot get MRI due to
   pacemaker. UA negative for infection though certainly infection could
   cause re-presentation of neuro deficits.
   - risk stratification with A1c, lipids in AM
   - hold any anticoagulation as per above
   - consider CTA after acute bleed addressed (per Neurology)
   - no sign of infection but will send blood cx with AM labs
   #. Hypertension: Hypertensive on arrival, now with BPs 120s while
   resting comfortably.
   - Hold all antihypertensives
   - consider BB (due to ? ischemia) if SBP > 185
   #. Anemia: Baseline Hct unknown. Add on iron studies

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a subdural hemorrhage, hypertension, and possible expressive aphasia. She has undergone a CT scan, which showed a small area of acute hemorrhage in a chronic-appearing subdural space. The patient has been treated with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to reverse her elevated international normalized ratio (INR).

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 212,000/μL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.08 ng/mL
* Glucose: 135 mg/dL
* White blood cell count: 6.9 × 10^9/L

The patient's physical examination is significant for:

* No radial or digital pulses on the right side
* No assessment of skin, neurologic, or peripheral vascular status due to the patient's altered mental status

The patient's medical history is significant for:

* Hypertension
* Subdural hemorrhage
* Osteoporosis
* GERD
* FEN (possibly related to the subdural hemorrhage)

Potential medical complications include:

* Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's subdural hemorrhage and elevated INR
* Potential for ischemia or infarction due to the patient's hypertension and possible lacunar infarct
* Risk of infection due to the patient's altered mental status and potential for aspiration
* Risk of cardiac complications due to the patient's chest pain and potential for myocardial infarction
* Risk of electrolyte imbalances due to the patient's altered mental status and potential for dehydration
* Risk of bleeding due to the patient's anticoagulation therapy

Based on the patient's condition and potential medical complications, the following plan has been developed:

* Hold all anticoagulation therapy
* Monitor the patient's INR closely and repeat head CT scans as needed
* Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and serial EKGs to rule out myocardial infarction
* Obtain an old EKG from the patient's primary care physician or emergency department
* Consider a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) after the patient's acute bleed has been addressed
* Hold fosamax and resume when the patient is clinically stable
* Continue ppi for GERD
* Hold antihypertensives and consider beta-blockers if the patient's blood pressure remains elevated
* Monitor the patient's electrolytes and consider repleting as needed
* Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider supplemental nutrition if necessary
* Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis and consider VAP prophylaxis
* Monitor the patient's code status and consider discussing with the patient and family

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-inch tall individual who has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 61 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 127/59 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 12 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient is receiving respiratory support with nasal cannula oxygen delivery and has a SpO2 of 97%. The patient's ABG results are not provided.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the lack of assessment in several areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and tone.

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.9-7.4 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 29.2-28.1%
* Platelet count: 212-215 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9-0.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.08-0.09 ng/mL
* Glucose: 135-154 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 17.0/27.9/1.5, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 87/4/0.09, Ca++: 8.6 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 3.0 mg/dL

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, infusions, and other ICU medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis due to the patient's low white blood cell count and elevated troponin-T levels
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation
* Cardiac complications due to the patient's heart rhythm and troponin-T levels
* Renal failure due to the patient's creatinine levels
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to the patient's immobility and lack of DVT prophylaxis
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to the patient's glucose levels and lack of glycemic control

Based on the patient's condition and lab results, it is recommended to continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, lab results, and respiratory status. Additionally, the patient's medication regimen should be reviewed and adjusted as necessary to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o woman with subdural hematoma and possible TIA.  TIA symptoms
   have resolved but SDH persists.  She also has substantial hypoxemia in
   the setting of multiple units of FFP.  Current problems include:
          Subdural hematoma
          Abnormal EKG and slightly positive troponin (neurogenic vs.
   cardiac)
          Normotense in the setting of history of hypertension
          Anemia
          Hypoxemia
   We will continue seizure prophylaxis.  She will likely need SDH
   drainage per neurosurgery.  We will follow up the echocardiogram report
   and ask cardiology to comment on risk-reducing maneuvers.
   Her hypoxemia is also concerning.  Most likely related to FFP: we will
   check a CXR to start the evaluation.
   For her anemia, we will guaiac stool and follow serial Hcts.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o woman with subdural hematoma and possible TIA.  TIA symptoms
   have resolved but SDH persists.  She also has substantial hypoxemia in
   the setting of multiple units of FFP.  Current problems include:
          Subdural hematoma
          Abnormal EKG and slightly positive troponin (neurogenic vs.
   cardiac)
          Normotense in the setting of history of hypertension
          Anemia
          Hypoxemia
   We will continue seizure prophylaxis.  She will likely need SDH
   drainage per neurosurgery.  We will follow up the echocardiogram report
   and ask cardiology to comment on risk-reducing maneuvers.
   Her hypoxemia is also concerning.  Most likely related to FFP: we will
   check a CXR to start the evaluation.
   For her anemia, we will guaiac stool and follow serial Hcts.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a subdural hematoma and possible transient ischemic attack (TIA). She has ongoing headache symptoms and is receiving seizure prophylaxis. The patient has abnormal EKG and slightly positive troponin levels, which may be related to neurogenic or cardiac causes. She is normotensive despite a history of hypertension. The patient has anemia, hypoxemia, and is receiving multiple units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). She is currently NPO and will undergo further evaluation for her hypoxemia with a chest X-ray. Serial hemoglobin levels will be monitored for her anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cerebral edema: The patient's subdural hematoma may lead to increased intracranial pressure and cerebral edema, which can worsen her neurological symptoms.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia may progress to respiratory failure, particularly if her lung disease is not well-controlled.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's abnormal EKG and positive troponin levels may indicate cardiac damage or ischemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia may be related to gastrointestinal bleeding, which can worsen her anemia and increase her risk of bleeding complications.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay may increase her risk of developing nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's receipt of multiple units of FFP may lead to thrombocytopenia, which can increase her risk of bleeding complications.
7. Fluid overload: The patient's receipt of multiple units of FFP may also lead to fluid overload, which can worsen her hypoxemia and increase her risk of respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o woman with subdural hematoma and possible TIA vs partial
   seizures as well as what appears to be an acute MI with substantial
   heart failure.  TIA symptoms have resolved but SDH persists.  She also
   has substantial hypoxemia in the setting of multiple units of FFP and
   newly diagnosed systolic CHF.  Current problems include:
   # SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
 Stable. INR goal 1. Currently 1.4.  Very
   high risk surgical candidate per cards
 prefer medical management.
   -          Vitamin K 10mg PO today
   -          avoid warfarin until cleared by neurosurg
   -          follow INR.  At this point (given pulmonary edema), risks of
   FFP outweigh benefits barring further changes in SDH or increases in
   INR
   -          surgical management per neurosurgery
   -          change neuro checks to q4hours
   -          convert dilantin to PO for sz ppx/control
   -          f/u neurosurg, neurology recs
   # MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   -          management limited by SDH
   -          beta blockade.  Will tolerate SBPs down to 110 for now
   -          diurese gently today to try to decrease myocardial O2 demand
   and improve pulmonary edema (-500 goal)
   # TIA vs Seizure
 Aside from RUE weakness, sx largely resolved.
   -          f/u neurosurgery, neurology recs
   -          continue dilantin
   -          consider CTA as per neuro for further characterization of ?
   ischemia in setting of inability to do MR b/c pacer
   # HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE
   -          diuresis as above
   -          beta blockade given risk of VT in peri-infarct period
   -          hold on ACEI for now given that above takes priority and BP
   is limited
   -          f/u outpatient cardiology records (esp echo to determine if
   any acute ischemic changes manifesting as new pulmonary edema)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a subdural hematoma, possible TIA vs partial seizures, and an acute myocardial infarction with substantial heart failure. The patient has undergone burr hole surgery, and her condition remains stable. However, she has ongoing complications, including:

1. Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH): The patient is at high risk for surgical complications and is being managed medically with Vitamin K and INR monitoring.
2. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient has acute MI with substantial heart failure, which is being managed with beta blockade and diuresis to control blood pressure and pulmonary edema.
3. TIA vs Seizure: The patient's symptoms have largely resolved, and she is being followed up with neurosurgery and neurology recommendations.
4. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has acute systolic heart failure, which is being managed with diuresis and beta blockade to control blood pressure and pulmonary edema.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and iron studies are pending.
6. GERD: The patient has GERD, and PPI is being prescribed.
7. Osteoarthritis: The patient has stable osteoarthritis.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 6.9-13.7 K/uL
* Hct: 29.2-33.5%
* Plt: [no value]
* Cr: 0.8-0.9 mg/dL

The patient's imaging results show:

* No significant change in chronic left subdural hematoma
* Echo: extensive regional LV systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Increased risk of bleeding due to SDH and anticoagulation therapy
2. Further myocardial damage due to ongoing MI and heart failure
3. Development of seizures or TIA due to underlying brain injury
4. Worsening of heart failure and pulmonary edema
5. Anemia worsening due to ongoing bleeding or inadequate treatment
6. Increased risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism due to immobility and anticoagulation therapy
7. Development of sepsis or secondary infections due to ongoing medical interventions and immobility

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to minimize the risk of these complications and optimize her outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o woman with subdural hematoma and possible TIA as well as what
   appears to be an acute MI with substantial heart failure..  TIA
   symptoms have resolved but SDH persists.  She also has substantial
   hypoxemia in the setting of multiple units of FFP and newly diagnosed
   systolic CHF.  Current problems include:
 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
   -          continue vitamin K
   -          avoid warfarin until cleared by neurosurg
   -          follow INR.  At this point (given pulmonary edema), risks of
   FFP outweigh benefits barring further changes in SDH or increases in
   INR
   -          surgical management per neurosurgery
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   -          management limited by SDH
   -          beta blockade.  Will tolerate SBPs down to 110 for now
   -          diurese gently today to try to decrease myocardial O2 demand
   and improve pulmonary edema
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE
   -          diuresis as above
   -          beta blockade given risk of VT in peri-infarct period
   -          hold on ACEI for now given that above takes priority and BP
   is limited
 Anemia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o woman with subdural hematoma and possible TIA vs partial
   seizures as well as what appears to be an acute MI with substantial
   heart failure.  TIA symptoms have resolved but SDH persists.  She also
   has substantial hypoxemia in the setting of multiple units of FFP and
   newly diagnosed systolic CHF.  Current problems include:
   # SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
 Stable. INR goal 1. Currently 1.3.  Very
   high risk surgical candidate per cards
 prefer medical management.
   -          Vitamin K 10mg PO today
   -          surgical management electively or in the case of acute
   decompensation
   -          neuro checks to q4hours

   -          management limited by SDH
   -          beta blockade.  Will tolerate SBPs down to 110 for now
   -          increase ASA to 325 mg ok by neuro and neurosurg
   -          diurese gently today to try to decrease myocardial O2 demand
   and improve pulmonary edema (-500 goal)
   -          per cards, would like to add lisinopril 5mg if BP will
   tolerate
 assess BP tomorrow to determine if BP will tolerate
   -          lasix 40mg IV today for goal -500 mls
   # TIA vs Seizure

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with a subdural hematoma (SDH), possible transient ischemic attack (TIA) or partial seizures, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with substantial heart failure. 

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH): The patient is at high risk for surgical complications and is being managed medically with Vitamin K and close monitoring.
2. Myocardial Infarction (AMI): The patient has acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and is being managed with beta blockade, diuresis, and ASA. Lisinopril may be added if the patient's blood pressure tolerates it.
3. TIA/Seizure: The patient's symptoms have largely resolved, and she is being followed by neurosurgery and neurology.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, and her hemoglobin levels will be followed.
5. GERD: The patient is being treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
6. Osteoarthritis: The patient's osteoarthritis is stable.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of the SDH, leading to increased intracranial pressure and potential for surgical intervention.
2. Cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or further cardiac damage.
3. Respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
4. Infection, particularly given the patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged ICU stay.
5. Thrombotic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), due to immobility and risk factors.
6. Nutritional deficiencies or malnutrition due to inadequate nutrition and prolonged ICU stay.

The patient's management plan includes close monitoring, medical management of her conditions, and potential transfer to the floor team once stabilized."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o woman with subdural hematoma and possible TIA vs partial
   seizures as well as what appears to be an acute MI with substantial
   heart failure.  TIA symptoms have resolved but SDH persists.  She also
   has substantial hypoxemia in the setting of multiple units of FFP and
   newly diagnosed systolic CHF.  Current problems include:
   # SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
 Stable. INR goal 1. Currently 1.4.  Very
   high risk surgical candidate per cards
 prefer medical management.
   -          Vitamin K 10mg PO today
   -          avoid warfarin until cleared by neurosurg
   -          follow INR.  At this point (given pulmonary edema), risks of
   FFP outweigh benefits barring further changes in SDH or increases in
   INR
   -          surgical management per neurosurgery
   -          change neuro checks to q4hours
   -          convert dilantin to PO for sz ppx/control
   -          f/u neurosurg, neurology recs
   # MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   -          management limited by SDH
   -          beta blockade.  Will tolerate SBPs down to 110 for now
   -          diurese gently today to try to decrease myocardial O2 demand
   and improve pulmonary edema (-500 goal)
   # TIA vs Seizure
 Aside from RUE weakness, sx largely resolved.
   -          f/u neurosurgery, neurology recs
   -          continue dilantin
   -          consider CTA as per neuro for further characterization of ?
   ischemia in setting of inability to do MR b/c pacer
   # HEART FAILURE (CHF), SYSTOLIC, ACUTE
   -          diuresis as above
   -          beta blockade given risk of VT in peri-infarct period
   -          hold on ACEI for now given that above takes priority and BP
   is limited
   -          f/u outpatient cardiology records (esp echo to determine if
   any acute ischemic changes manifesting as new pulmonary edema)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a subdural hematoma (SDH), possible TIA vs partial seizures, and an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with substantial heart failure. The patient's current problems include:

1. Subdural Hemorrhage (SDH): The patient's SDH is stable, and the INR goal is 1, currently at 1.4. The patient is a high-risk surgical candidate, and medical management is preferred. Vitamin K 10mg PO is ordered, and warfarin is to be avoided until cleared by neurosurgery.
2. Myocardial Infarction, Acute (AMI): The patient's AMI management is limited by the SDH. Beta blockade is ordered, and diuresis is to be done gently to decrease myocardial O2 demand and improve pulmonary edema.
3. TIA vs Seizure: The patient's symptoms have largely resolved, aside from RUE weakness. Follow-up with neurosurgery and neurology is recommended, and dilantin is to be continued. A CTA may be considered for further characterization of ischemia.
4. Heart Failure (CHF), Systolic, Acute: Diuresis is ordered to decrease myocardial O2 demand and improve pulmonary edema. Beta blockade is given to reduce the risk of VT in the peri-infarct period. ACEI is to be held for now due to the priority of managing the patient's heart failure.
5. Anemia: Iron studies are to be followed up.
6. GERD: PPI is ordered.
7. Osteoarthritis: The patient's osteoarthritis is stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Increased risk of bleeding due to the SDH and warfarin therapy
* Cardiac arrhythmias and worsening heart failure due to the AMI and heart failure
* Seizure recurrence due to the possible TIA vs partial seizures
* Pneumonia or respiratory failure due to the patient's hypoxemia and pulmonary edema
* Worsening anemia due to ongoing bleeding or inadequate iron replacement
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to GERD
* Osteoporosis or joint instability due to osteoarthritis

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 y/o woman with subdural hematoma and possible TIA as well as what
   appears to be an acute MI with substantial heart failure.  TIA symptoms
   have resolved but SDH persists.  Her hypoxemia has improved but not
   resolved with diuresis. Current problems include:

 SUBDURAL HEMORRHAGE (SDH)
          continue vitamin K
          avoid warfarin until cleared by neurosurg
          follow INR.  At this point (given pulmonary edema), risks of
   FFP outweigh benefits barring further changes in SDH or increases in
   INR
          surgical management per neurosurgery.  At present, the plan
   is to follow with intermittent CTs and neuro checks.  If her neurologic
   status declines she would need more urgent intervention.  However, the
   risks of surgical intervention are high in the peri-infarct period and
   we will defer as long as feasible.  Right now, I agree with
   neurosurgery and cardiology that the risks of surgical intervention
   outweigh benefits.
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
          management limited by SDH
          Beta blockade.  Rhythm is not clear on telemetry right now
   (a-sensed v-paced vs. v-paced only).  Will check 12 lead and discuss
   with cardiology.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a subdural hematoma (SDH), possible transient ischemic attack (TIA), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). She has improved hypoxemia with diuresis, but still requires oxygen therapy. The patient has a pacemaker and is receiving treatment for heart failure, anemia, and possible stress ulcer. Her current problems include SDH, AMI, and heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Increased risk of bleeding due to SDH and anticoagulation therapy:
	* Monitor INR levels and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
	* Avoid invasive procedures or surgery unless absolutely necessary.
2. Cardiovascular complications:
	* Monitor for signs of heart failure, such as increased shortness of breath, swelling, or decreased urine output.
	* Adjust beta blockade and diuretic therapy as necessary to manage heart failure.
	* Consider ACEI therapy when beta blockade is maximized or after a week.
3. Respiratory complications:
	* Monitor for signs of respiratory failure, such as increased respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, or increased work of breathing.
	* Adjust oxygen therapy as necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.
4. Neurological complications:
	* Monitor for signs of worsening neurological status, such as increased headache, confusion, or decreased level of consciousness.
	* Consider surgical management of SDH if neurological status declines.
5. Infection:
	* Monitor for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, or changes in respiratory or cardiovascular status.
	* Consider prophylactic antibiotics for stress ulcer and DVT prevention.
6. Anemia:
	* Monitor for signs of worsening anemia, such as decreased hemoglobin levels or increased fatigue.
	* Consider transfusion therapy if hemoglobin levels become critically low.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions to prevent complications and optimize her care."
