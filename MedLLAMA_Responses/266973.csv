   transferred to rehab.
   In rehab has experienced hemoptysis and persistent CP. Today dyspnea
   worsened and referred to ER. In ER she was hypotensive and CXR showed
   right pneumomonia. She was placed on levophed. An echo showed EF 20%.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and a history of recent NSTEMI requiring 3 stents, complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring a balloon pump for 3 days. She was transferred to rehab, where she experienced hemoptysis and persistent chest pain. She was readmitted to the ICU due to worsening dyspnea and was found to have right pneumomonia on CXR. She is currently on levophed and has an EF of 20%. The patient is critically ill with multiple comorbidities, including cardiomyopathy, recent MI, and renal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's depressed EF and recent MI make her susceptible to infection, which could lead to further cardiogenic shock and worsen her condition.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's right pneumomonia and cough could progress to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiomyopathy and recent MI increase her risk of cardiac arrest, especially with the use of levophed.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal insufficiency could worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or even end-stage renal disease.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's unclear cause of coagulopathy could lead to bleeding complications or increased risk of infection.
6. Sepsis: The patient's recent MI and cardiomyopathy make her susceptible to sepsis, which could worsen her condition and lead to multi-organ failure.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's recent MI and cardiomyopathy increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, especially with the use of anticoagulant medications.
8. Stroke: The patient's cardiomyopathy and recent MI increase her risk of stroke, especially with the use of levophed.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her cardiogenic shock, respiratory status, and renal function. Additionally, antibiotics should be started to treat her right pneumomonia, and further evaluation should be performed to determine the cause of her coagulopathy."

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman who recently had a STEMI, requiring 3 stents and a balloon pump for cardiogenic shock. She developed a-fib and was started on amiodarone and coumadin. She was transferred to rehab, where she experienced hemoptysis and persistent chest pain. She was referred to the ER due to worsening dyspnea and was found to have right pneumomonia. She was placed on levophed and has a depressed EF of 20%. The patient is currently in the ICU, receiving treatment for pneumonia, shock, and coagulopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening dyspnea and pneumonia may lead to respiratory failure, which could require intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's depressed EF and recent MI make her susceptible to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, or cardiogenic shock.
3. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and recent history of cardiogenic shock increase her risk of developing a secondary infection, which could further complicate her condition.
4. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest potential renal insufficiency, which could worsen her condition.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy, likely due to excess coumadin, may increase her risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hemoptysis.
6. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and recent history of hemoptysis increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could be life-threatening.
7. Septic Shock: The patient's pneumonia and potential secondary infection may lead to septic shock, which could be fatal if not recognized and treated promptly.
8. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest potential acute kidney injury, which could worsen her condition and increase her risk of complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and adjusting her treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these complications."

 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with increasing SOB, found to be hypotensive.
   # Hypotension:  This is mostly likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia
   in the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.  Pt is also
   reporting diarrhea and may have developed c. diff though on flagyl.  In
   addition, U/A is equivocal.  As far as cardiogenic reasons for shock,
   EF is 20% on prelim ECHO read and reportedly stable per son-in-law.
   Unlikely to have restent thrombosis or second ACS event as CK, CK-MB
   are flat.  Trop is likely coming down.  Unfortuantely, there are no
   records from [**Hospital3 1004**] available yet.  Patient may also be slightly
   volume depleted.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, coronary artery disease (CAD), and pneumonia. She has a history of recent massive NSTEMI at another hospital, which was treated with three stents and IABP. She presents with increasing shortness of breath, hypotension, and diarrhea.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of CAD and recent massive NSTEMI, cardiogenic shock is a concern. The patient's EF is 20%, which may indicate further cardiac compromise.
2. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is likely due to RLL pneumonia, which can worsen her overall condition.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be due to C. diff, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen her bleeding risk, particularly at the RIJ site.
5. Elevated creatinine: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate kidney dysfunction or damage.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is elevated, which may indicate insulin resistance or diabetes.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is necessary to maintain her oxygenation, but she may be at risk for respiratory failure if her condition worsens.
8. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of CAD and recent massive NSTEMI may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias, such as AFib.
9. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and septic shock may increase her risk of developing further infections.
10. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock and cardiogenic shock may lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including renal, respiratory, and cardiac failure.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and treat potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and was treated with three stents and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for cardiogenic shock. She was also diagnosed with pneumonia and septic shock, requiring pressors.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.6°C, heart rate 71 beats per minute, blood pressure 115/59 mmHg, respiratory rate 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) 11 mmHg, cardiac index (CI) trending down, and echocardiogram (ECHO) showing a depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 20%.
* Respiratory support: Intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 30.8 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL, platelet count 510 x 10^9/L, creatinine 1.4 mg/dL, and lactate 2.5 mmol/L.
* Other findings: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), and her ECHO shows severe depressed EF, suggesting a recent myocardial infarction. She also has a history of asthma and is experiencing severe wheezing on exam.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient's CVP is elevated, and her CI is trending down, suggesting a high risk of septic shock.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's depressed EF and history of recent STEMI increase her risk of cardiogenic shock.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation, and she may require further respiratory support.
4. Diarrhea and potential CDiff: The patient's diarrhea may be caused by Clostridioides difficile (CDiff) infection, which can lead to severe colitis and complications.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated PTT and history of coumadin therapy increase her risk of bleeding and coagulopathy.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent STEMI increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management to prevent and treat any potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, found to be
   hypotensive and hypoxemic.
   # Hypotension:  Multifactorial with septic shock from RLL pneumonia in
   the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.  Pt is also
   reporting diarrhea and may have developed c. diff though on flagyl.
   Off pressors with CVP of 12.
   - F/U cultures
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs
   - Obtain records from [**Hospital3 1004**]
   - Follow up final ECHO
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely [**1-22**] PNA with superimposed
   asthma flare.
   - Continue albuterol MDI (not tolerated nebs)
   - Steroids started for asthma flare
   - Pt intubated due to persistent resp distress and high WOB.
   Oxygenation adequate, will check ABG
   # Diarrhea:  Pt reports 1 week of diarrhea.  Could be C. diff, although
   unlikely given recent flagyl.  Elevated WBC count today prompted
   initiation of PO vanc.
   - Check C. diff
   - Continue PO vanc
 will d/c if c. diff neg x 2
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%:  EKG shows no acute ischemic
   changes, per Cardiology, just old massive anterior MI.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold amiodarone, BB as hypotensive
   - supratherapeutic
   # Coagulopathy:  Was on coumadin for afib at [**Hospital 7735**].  Only slight
   oozing at RIJ site and mild hemoptysis.  Also with elevated PTT.
   - Follow coags
   - Check to see if on SQ heparin at rehab to explain elevated PTT
   - Hold coumadin
   - Check DIC labs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant past medical history of recent massive NSTEMI, who presents to the ICU with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea. She has a poor ejection fraction (EF 20%) due to the recent massive NSTEMI and is experiencing cardiogenic shock. She also has a right lower lobe pneumonia, which is likely superimposed on a pre-existing asthma flare. The patient is hypotensive and hypoxemic, requiring pressor support, and has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Cardiogenic shock due to poor EF and septic shock from RLL pneumonia.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to PNA with superimposed asthma flare.
3. Diarrhea, which may be due to C. difficile (C. diff) infection, although unlikely given recent flagyl treatment.
4. Coagulopathy with elevated PTT, possibly due to coumadin use at a previous hospital.
5. Afib, which is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. F/u cultures and continue vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.
2. Trend CEs, serial EKGs, and obtain records from a previous hospital.
3. Follow up final ECHO.
4. Continue albuterol MDI and steroids for asthma flare.
5. Monitor for C. diff and continue PO vanc, but discontinue if C. diff is negative on two occasions.
6. Continue ASA, plavix, and high-dose atorvastatin for CAD.
7. Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, and lasix.
8. Monitor for coagulopathy and follow coags, check for SQ heparin use, and hold coumadin.
9. Check DIC labs.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening cardiogenic shock due to septic shock or respiratory failure.
2. Development of C. diff infection or other gastrointestinal complications.
3. Progression of coagulopathy or bleeding complications.
4. Further deterioration of respiratory function or development of respiratory failure.
5. Increased risk of arrhythmias due to Afib or other cardiac conditions.
6. Potential for further cardiac complications, such as acute coronary syndrome or cardiac tamponade.

Given the patient's complex medical conditions and multiple medications, close monitoring and careful management are necessary to prevent potential complications and optimize her care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with increasing SOB, found to be hypotensive.
   # Hypotension:  This is mostly likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia
   in the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.  Pt is also
   reporting diarrhea and may have developed c. diff though on flagyl.  In
   addition, U/A is equivocal.  As far as cardiogenic reasons for shock,
   EF is 20% on prelim ECHO read and reportedly stable per son-in-law.
   Unlikely to have restent thrombosis or second ACS event as CK, CK-MB
   are flat.  Trop is likely coming down.  Unfortuantely, there are no
   records from [**Hospital3 1004**] available yet.  Patient may also be slightly
   volume depleted.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of recent massive NSTEMI, s/p 3 stents, complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring IABP for 3 days, and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin. She presents to the ICU with increasing shortness of breath, hypotension, and diarrhea. Her EF is 20% on preliminary echo read, and she has a RML infiltrate on CXR. The patient is likely in septic shock from RLL pneumonia, and may have developed C. diff. She is also reporting diarrhea and may have developed C. diff, although this is unlikely given co-treatment with levaquin and flagyl. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine, and she has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma, diabetes mellitus type 2, and GERD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient is at risk of developing septic shock due to her RLL pneumonia, which may lead to multi-organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
2. C. diff: The patient may have developed C. diff, which can lead to severe diarrhea, dehydration, and increased risk of mortality.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's EF is 20%, which increases her risk of developing cardiogenic shock, especially in the setting of septic shock.
4. Volume depletion: The patient may be slightly volume depleted due to her diarrhea and recent massive MI, which can lead to hypotension and decreased cardiac output.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of coumadin use and may be at risk of developing coagulopathy, which can lead to bleeding complications.
6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which increases her risk of developing renal failure, especially in the setting of septic shock.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's RML infiltrate on CXR may lead to respiratory failure, especially if she develops pneumonia.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's recent massive MI and cardiogenic shock may lead to cardiovascular instability, especially if she develops tachycardia or bradycardia.

Recommendations:

1. Broaden coverage for HAP with vancomycin and Zosyn.
2. Trend CEs and serial EKGs to monitor the patient's cardiac status.
3. Obtain records from [**Hospital3 1004**] to clarify the patient's medical history.
4. Follow up with final echo to assess the patient's cardiac function.
5. Continue levophed to support the patient's blood pressure.
6. Check for C. diff and hold treatment if positive.
7. Monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust treatment accordingly.
8. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis with H2 blocker to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, found to be
   hypotensive and hypoxemic.
   # Hypotension:  This is mostly likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia
   in the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.  Pt is also
   reporting diarrhea and may have developed c. diff though on flagyl.
   Off pressors with CVP of 12.
   - F/U cultures
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs
   - Obtain records from [**Hospital3 1004**]
   - Follow up final ECHO
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely [**1-22**] PNA with superimposed
   asthma flare.
   - Continue albuterol MDI (not tolerated nebs)
   - Start steroids
   - ABG
   # Diarrhea:  Pt reports 1 week of diarrhea.  Could be C. diff, although
   unlikely given recent flagyl.  Elevated WBC count today prompted
   initiation of PO vanc.
   - Check C. diff
   - Continue PO vanc
 will d/c if c. diff neg x 2
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%:  EKG shows no acute ischemic
   changes, per Cardiology, just old massive anterior MI.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold amiodarone, BB as hypotensive
   - supratherapeutic
   # Coagulopathy:  Was on coumadin for afib at [**Hospital 7735**].  Only slight
   oozing at RIJ site and mild hemoptysis.  Also with elevated PTT.
   - Follow coags
   - Check to see if on SQ heparin at rehab to explain elevated PTT
   - Hold coumadin
   - Check DIC labs

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of recent massive NSTEMI, complicated by cardiogenic shock, pneumonia, and 3 stents. She presents from rehab with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea, found to be hypotensive and hypoxemic. She has a low ejection fraction (20%) and is on various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and antiplatelet agents. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and hypoxemia may be due to septic shock from the right lower lobe pneumonia, which is complicated by a low ejection fraction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure, which may be due to a combination of pneumonia and asthma flare.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be due to Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection, although it is unlikely given recent treatment with flagyl.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which may be due to her history of atrial fibrillation and warfarin therapy.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's low ejection fraction and history of recent myocardial infarction put her at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and heart failure.
6. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and diarrhea may be due to bacterial or viral infections, which require prompt treatment and management.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diarrhea may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Renal complications: The patient's hypotension and hypoxemia may lead to acute kidney injury or worsening of pre-existing kidney disease.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, close monitoring and management in the ICU are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. They were intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to anterior septal STEMI, 3 stents placed to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) of 35. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anterior septal STEMI, and coronary artery disease (CAD). They are receiving vasopressors, including levophed and dopamine, and have a lactate level of 4. The patient has a white blood cell count of 37.5 and was treated for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with levo and flagyl for empiric C. difficile. They have a history of diarrhea and are requiring 2.5 mcg/kg/min of neo overnight.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 106/58 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are pH 7.32, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 44 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 99 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 37.5, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 522 K/uL. The patient's troponin-T level is 1.93 ng/mL, and their lactate level is 1.7 mmol/L. The patient's blood cultures are pending.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for invasive ventilation put them at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's lactate level of 4 and white blood cell count of 37.5 suggest the possibility of sepsis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's anterior septal STEMI, coronary artery disease, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 35 put them at risk for cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's white blood cell count of 37.5 and treatment for CAP suggest the possibility of pneumonia.
5. C. difficile colitis: The patient's treatment with flagyl for empiric C. difficile and history of diarrhea put them at risk for C. difficile colitis.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's treatment with anticoagulation and platelet count of 522 K/uL put them at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's risk factors for venous thromboembolism, such as immobility and hypercoagulability, put them at risk for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism."

 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI (based on q-waves and severly depressed
   ef, record pending) at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents IABP x 3 days for
   cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin,
   presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, in septic shock
   requiring pressors
   # Hypotension:  Given distributive shock, o2 requirement, and CXR
   infiltrate, this is most likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  CDIFF may also be contributing.  Given CVP=12,
   stable EKG, and CE trending down, favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock,
   but will continue to rule out MI given worsened status this am.
   - F/U cultures
   - SWITCH vanc/zosyn to vanco/cefepime/cipro
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs
   - Obtain records from [**Hospital3 1004**]
   - Follow up final ECHO
   - favor neo over levophed given recent MI and acutely depressed EF.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing: Likely
   [**1-22**] PNA with some contributiion from astma given severe wheezing on
   exam.  Other concern would be LV failure from ischemia, but arguing
   against this is CVP=12avg.
   - s/p intubation; needs a-line
   - steroidsx 5 days, MDIs
   # Diarrhea:  Empiric CDIFF covg given marked leukocytosis with PO
   vanco. f/u cdiff tox x2
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes trending down
   suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively stable, some
   rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   - favor neo over levophed as above
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life
   means she will be therapeutic for a while)
   - supratherapeutic
   # Coagulopathy:  Was on coumadin for afib at [**Hospital 7735**].  Only slight
   oozing at RIJ site and mild hemoptysis.  Also with elevated PTT.-

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, septic shock, and acute coronary syndrome (STEMI) following a recent myocardial infarction. She was treated with invasive ventilation, vasopressors, and antibiotics, and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, anxiety, and septic shock. Her cardiac enzymes are trending down, suggesting that the ACS is not contributing to her condition. She has also been diagnosed with pneumonia, and is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and the presence of pneumonia, she is at high risk for developing VAP.
2. Sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction: The patient's septic shock and depressed ejection fraction (EF) increase her risk for developing cardiac dysfunction.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen if she does not receive adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's recent myocardial infarction and depressed EF increase her risk for developing cardiovascular complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
5. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and septic shock increase her risk for developing further infections, such as central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) or catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy increases her risk for bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diarrhea and potential sepsis increase her risk for developing gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's septic shock and depressed EF increase her risk for developing neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or encephalopathy.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach to management. She requires continued mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and antibiotics to treat her septic shock and pneumonia. She also requires close monitoring of her cardiac enzymes, EKGs, and CVP to assess her cardiac function and risk for developing cardiac complications. Additionally, she requires prophylaxis for VAP, DVT, and stress ulcer, and close monitoring for signs of bleeding or coagulopathy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 ANXIETY
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, in
   septic shock still requiring pressors. Intubated yesterday for
   increased work of breathing.
    # Hypotension:  Given distributive shock, o2 requirement, and CXR
   infiltrate, this is most likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  CDIFF may also be contributing.  Given CVP=12,
   stable EKG, and serial CE trending down, favor sepsis over cardiogenic
   shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs with any major hemodynamic changes
   - favor neo over levophed given recent MI and acutely depressed EF.
   - trial of fluids in effor to wean pressors, will be cautious given
   acutely depressed LVEF
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing: Likely
   [**1-22**] PNA with some contributiion from astma given severe wheezing on
   exam.  Other concern would be LV failure from ischemia, but arguing
   against this is CVP=12avg.
   - s/p intubation; A-LINE attempts failed, will trend serial ABGS and
   venous gases
   - will attempt to wean PSV from [**11-24**] to [**9-24**], RSBI 28, goal extubate
   tomorrow if tolerates wean
   - steroidsx 5 days, MDIs
   # Diarrhea/Leukocytosis:  Empiric CDIFF covg given marked leukocytosis
   with PO vanco. f/u cdiff tox x2
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs for any hemodynamic changes
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   - favor neo over levophed as above; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life
   means she will be therapeutic for a while)
   - therapeutic on coumadin but INR trending down rapidly; resuming

   Disposition: icu, intubated<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female who presented with respiratory distress, septic shock, and acute coronary syndrome. She was intubated yesterday for increased work of breathing and is currently receiving invasive ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/58 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 9 inspirations per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on 50% FiO2. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 14 mmHg, which is stable.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 37.5 K/uL, and she is being treated for possible Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Her cardiac enzymes are trending down, suggesting that the acute coronary syndrome is not contributing to her condition. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) shows a relatively stable rhythm, with some rate-dependent ST depressions inferiorly.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia, with some contribution from asthma given the severe wheezing on examination. Her hypoxemic respiratory failure is being managed with invasive ventilation, and she is being weaned from the pressors.

The patient's diarrhea is being treated with empirical C. diff coverage, and her cardiac condition is being managed with aspirin, clopidogrel, and high-dose atorvastatin. Her anticoagulation is being managed with warfarin, and she is being bridged with heparin for an INR < 2 to prevent left ventricular thrombus.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, which increases the risk of VAP.
2. C. diff infection: The patient is being treated for possible C. diff infection, and the empirical coverage may not be effective if the infection is caused by a different organism.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of acute coronary syndrome and is at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
4. Sepsis: The patient is septic and at risk for further deterioration and organ failure.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is hypoxemic and at risk for further respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has diarrhea and is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and sepsis.
7. Renal failure: The patient is at risk for renal failure due to sepsis, hypotension, and nephrotoxic medications.
8. Hepatic failure: The patient is at risk for hepatic failure due to sepsis, hypotension, and nephrotoxic medications.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve her outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, found to be
   hypotensive and hypoxemic.
   # Hypotension:  Multifactorial with septic shock from RLL pneumonia in
   the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.  Pt is also
   reporting diarrhea and may have developed c. diff though on flagyl.
   - F/U cultures
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Genlte IVF + wean pressors
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely [**1-22**] PNA with superimposed
   asthma flare.  Now intubated.
   - Continue albuterol MDI
   - Steroids started for asthma flare
   - Wean PS as tolerated
   # Diarrhea:  Pt reports 1 week of diarrhea.  Could be C. diff, although
   unlikely given recent flagyl.  Elevated WBC count today prompted
   initiation of PO vanc.
   - Check C. diff
   - Continue PO vanc
 will d/c if c. diff neg x 2
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%:  EKG shows no acute ischemic
   changes, per Cardiology, just old massive anterior MI.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - Hold amiodarone, BB as hypotensive
   - Restart coumadin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including recent massive NSTEMI, cardiogenic shock, and pneumonia. She presents with hypotension, hypoxemia, and diarrhea. She is intubated and on pressors for respiratory failure, which is likely due to pneumonia and asthma flare. She has a history of CAD and is taking medications for it. She also has a history of AFib, which is currently in sinus rhythm.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her pneumonia and recent antibiotic use.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's EF is 20%, and she has a history of CAD, which increases her risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia and asthma flare, and she is at risk of developing further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome.
4. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be due to C. diff, and she is at risk of developing further gastrointestinal complications such as colitis and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Thromboembolic complications: The patient is at risk of developing thromboembolic complications such as DVT and pulmonary embolism due to her immobility and recent surgery.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to her compromised immune system and recent antibiotic use.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiovascular instability increases her risk of developing further cardiovascular complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and heart failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and cardiovascular stability closely.
2. Continue to provide supportive care for her respiratory failure, including mechanical ventilation and pressors.
3. Continue to treat her pneumonia and asthma flare with antibiotics and bronchodilators.
4. Consider starting antibiotics for C. diff if her diarrhea persists.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medications as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
6. Consider starting anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic complications.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust her medications as necessary to prevent cardiovascular complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, found to be
   hypotensive and hypoxemic.
   # Hypotension:  Multifactorial with septic shock from RLL pneumonia in
   the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.  Pt is also
   reporting diarrhea and may have developed c. diff though on flagyl.
   Off pressors with CVP of 12.
   - F/U cultures
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs
   - Obtain records from [**Hospital3 1004**]
   - Follow up final ECHO
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely [**1-22**] PNA with superimposed
   asthma flare.
   - Continue albuterol MDI (not tolerated nebs)
   - Steroids started for asthma flare
   - Pt intubated due to persistent resp distress and high WOB.
   Oxygenation adequate, will check ABG
   # Diarrhea:  Pt reports 1 week of diarrhea.  Could be C. diff, although
   unlikely given recent flagyl.  Elevated WBC count today prompted
   initiation of PO vanc.
   - Check C. diff
   - Continue PO vanc
 will d/c if c. diff neg x 2
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%:  EKG shows no acute ischemic
   changes, per Cardiology, just old massive anterior MI.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold amiodarone, BB as hypotensive
   - supratherapeutic
   # Coagulopathy:  Was on coumadin for afib at [**Hospital 7735**].  Only slight
   oozing at RIJ site and mild hemoptysis.  Also with elevated PTT.
   - Follow coags
   - Check to see if on SQ heparin at rehab to explain elevated PTT
   - Hold coumadin
   - Check DIC labs

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including recent massive NSTEMI, cardiogenic shock, and pneumonia. The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypotension: Multifactorial, likely due to septic shock from RLL pneumonia, poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI, and potential C. diff infection.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely PNA with superimposed asthma flare, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Diarrhea: Reports 1 week of diarrhea, which could be C. diff, although unlikely given recent flagyl treatment.
4. Cardiac condition: CAD, s/p recent STEMI, with EF 20%, and currently on ASA, plavix, and high-dose atorvastatin.
5. Coagulopathy: Elevated PTT, possible SQ heparin at rehab, and mild hemoptysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may progress, requiring further interventions or mechanical ventilation.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's diarrhea and potential C. diff infection may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's CAD and poor EF may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or further myocardial infarction.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, leading to bleeding complications or further organ dysfunction.
6. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and potential C. diff infection may lead to further infection or sepsis.
7. Renal failure: The patient's hypotension and septic shock may lead to acute kidney injury or further renal dysfunction.
8. Liver dysfunction: The patient's sepsis and coagulopathy may lead to liver dysfunction or failure.

Based on this assessment, it is crucial to closely monitor the patient's condition, adjust treatment accordingly, and consider additional interventions to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, found to be
   hypotensive and hypoxemic.
   # Hypotension:  Multifactorial with septic shock from RLL pneumonia in
   the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.  Pt is also
   reporting diarrhea and may have developed c. diff though on flagyl.
   - F/U cultures
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Genlte IVF + wean pressors
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely [**1-22**] PNA with superimposed
   asthma flare.  Now intubated.
   - Continue albuterol MDI
   - Steroids started for asthma flare
   - Wean PS as tolerated
   # Diarrhea:  Pt reports 1 week of diarrhea.  Could be C. diff, although
   unlikely given recent flagyl.  Elevated WBC count yesterday prompted
   initiation of PO vanc.
   - Check C. diff
   - Continue PO vanc
 will d/c if c. diff neg x 2
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%:  EKG shows no acute ischemic
   changes, per Cardiology, just old massive anterior MI.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - Hold amiodarone, BB as hypotensive
   - Restart coumadin

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history. She has a recent massive NSTEMI with 3 stents placed, complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring IABP for 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin. She presents with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea, and is found to be hypotensive and hypoxemic.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, and is on pressors for hypotension. She has a multifactorial etiology for her hypotension, including septic shock from RLL pneumonia and poor left ventricular function from her recent NSTEMI. She is also experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to pneumonia with superimposed asthma flare.

The patient has a history of CAD, s/p recent STEMI, and now has an ejection fraction of 20%. She is on medications for CAD, including ASA, plavix, and high-dose atorvastatin, and has a history of AFib, which is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, CRP, and troponin-T, consistent with sepsis and cardiac injury. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has received antibiotics for pneumonia.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. F/U cultures to monitor for sepsis and pneumonia.
2. Continue vanc and zosyn antibiotics.
3. Gradually wean pressors and IV fluids.
4. Trend CEs and serial EKGs to monitor cardiac function.
5. Check for C. diff infection.
6. Continue PO vanc if C. diff is negative.
7. Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, and lasix medications.
8. Restart coumadin.
9. Continue ASA, plavix, and high-dose atorvastatin for CAD.
10. Monitor for signs of sepsis, pneumonia, and cardiac complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to untreated pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia progression and respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
4. C. diff infection, which can lead to severe diarrhea and electrolyte imbalance.
5. Hypotension and hypoxemia, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
6. Respiratory failure, which can lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
7. Cardiac tamponade or pericarditis, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
8. Pulmonary embolism, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her plan of care accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure her optimal recovery."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 ANXIETY
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, in
   septic shock still requiring pressors. Intubated yesterday for
   increased work of breathing.
    # Hypotension:  Given distributive shock, o2 requirement, and CXR
   infiltrate, this is most likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  CDIFF may also be contributing.  Given CVP=12,
   stable EKG, and serial CE trending down, favor sepsis over cardiogenic
   shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs with any major hemodynamic changes
   - favor neo over levophed given recent MI and acutely depressed EF.
   - trial of fluids in effor to wean pressors, will be cautious given
   acutely depressed LVEF
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing: Likely
   [**1-22**] PNA with some contributiion from astma given severe wheezing on
   exam.  Other concern would be LV failure from ischemia, but arguing
   against this is CVP=12avg.
   - s/p intubation; A-LINE attempts failed, will trend serial ABGS and
   venous gases
   - will attempt to wean PSV from [**11-24**] to [**9-24**], RSBI 28, goal extubate
   tomorrow if tolerates wean
   - steroidsx 5 days, MDIs
   # Diarrhea/Leukocytosis:  Empiric CDIFF covg given marked leukocytosis
   with PO vanco. f/u cdiff tox x2
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs for any hemodynamic changes
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   - favor neo over levophed as above; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life
   means she will be therapeutic for a while)
   - therapeutic on coumadin but INR trending down rapidly; resuming

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing: Likely
   [**1-22**] PNA with some contributiion from astma given severe wheezing on

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, septic shock, and coronary artery disease. The patient has a history of recent STEMI, which was treated with stents and IABP. She also has pneumonia, which was treated with Flagyl and Levaquin, and has presented with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. The patient's PaO2 is 100% on 50% FiO2.
* Septic shock: The patient is hypotensive, with a blood pressure of 95/47 mmHg, and is receiving vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.
* Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of recent STEMI and has been treated with stents and IABP. Her ejection fraction is 20%.
* Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which was treated with antibiotics, and has a leukocytosis of 30.8 K/uL.
* Diarrhea: The patient has diarrhea, which is likely related to the pneumonia.
* Cardiac enzymes: The patient's cardiac enzymes are continually trending down, suggesting that the acute coronary syndrome is not contributing to her current condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
* Septic shock: The patient's septic shock can worsen, leading to further hypotension and organ dysfunction.
* Coronary artery disease: The patient's coronary artery disease can worsen, leading to further myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
* Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia can worsen, leading to further respiratory failure and septic shock.
* Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea can worsen, leading to further dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function
* Vasopressors to maintain her blood pressure
* Antibiotics to treat her pneumonia
* Cardiac medications to manage her coronary artery disease
* Anti-diarrheal medications to manage her diarrhea
* Fluid management to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's family has been informed of her condition and has been instructed on her treatment plan. The patient's code status is full code."

 ANXIETY
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, in
   septic shock still requiring pressors. Intubated yesterday for
   increased work of breathing.
    # Hypotension:  Given distributive shock, o2 requirement, and CXR
   infiltrate, this is most likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs with any major hemodynamic changes
   - favor neo over levophed given recent MI and acutely depressed EF.
   - trial of fluids in effor to wean pressors, will be cautious given
   acutely depressed LVEF
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing: Likely
   [**1-22**] PNA with some contributiion from asthma given severe wheezing on
   exam.  .Tolerating SBT well this am.
   - extubate, BIPAP if flashes
   - steroidsx 5 days, MDIs
   # Diarrhea/Leukocytosis:  d/c empiric CDIFF covg given lack of
   diahrrea. f/u cdiff tox x2 when stools
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs for any hemodynamic changes
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   - favor neo over levophed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life
   means she will be therapeutic for a while)
   - therapeutic on coumadin but INR trending down rapidly; resumed

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU for septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and coronary artery disease. She has a history of recent STEMI, three stents, and an intra-aortic balloon pump for cardiogenic shock. She was previously treated for pneumonia with Flagyl and Levaquin, and presented to the hospital with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. She is also receiving oxygen therapy with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
* Hemodynamic status: She is in septic shock, with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg and a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 95 mmHg. She is receiving vasopressors to maintain her blood pressure.
* Cardiovascular status: She has a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%, with a history of recent STEMI and three stents. She is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and heparin.
* Renal status: Her creatinine level is 1.6 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 25 mg/dL.
* Neurological status: She is unable to assess her level of consciousness due to her intubation and sedation.
* Infectious status: She has a leukocytosis of 30.8 K/uL and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 1.93 mg/dL, suggesting an active infection. She is receiving empiric antibiotics with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require further interventions such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation.
* Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may worsen if not managed promptly and effectively.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's depressed LVEF and history of recent STEMI make her at risk for cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and BUN level suggest that she may be at risk for renal failure, which can further complicate her condition.
* Neurological complications: The patient's intubation and sedation may lead to neurological complications such as pressure ulcers, pneumonia, or respiratory failure.
* Infectious complications: The patient's active infection may lead to further complications such as sepsis, pneumonia, or bacteremia.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the following plan of care should be considered:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her mechanical ventilation settings as needed.
* Continue to manage her septic shock with vasopressors and antibiotics, and consider further interventions such as dialysis or surgical debridement if necessary.
* Continue to monitor her cardiac status and adjust her anticoagulation therapy as needed.
* Monitor her renal status and consider further interventions such as dialysis if necessary.
* Monitor her neurological status and consider further interventions such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation if necessary.
* Consider further interventions such as stress ulcer prophylaxis, DVT prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis to prevent potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a mechanically ventilated (MMV/PSV/AutoFlow) and sedated patient with a history of respiratory failure, anxiety, septic shock, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 82 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 95/47 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg.

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC) increasing from 20.5 to 30.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb) decreasing from 29.1 to 28.1 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt) decreasing from 11220 to unknown
* Creatinine (Cr) increasing from 1.3 to 1.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T increasing from 1.06 to 1.93 ng/mL
* TCO2 decreasing from 24 to 23 mmHg
* Glucose increasing from 191 to 230 mg/dL

The patient's medication list includes:

* Fentanyl 25 mcg/hour
* Phenylephrine 2.5 mcg/Kg/min
* Midazolam (Versed) 1 mg/hour
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Cefipime
* Ciprofloxacin
* Vancomycin
* Coumadin

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%, indicating a potential risk of respiratory failure.
* Septic shock: The patient's CVP is 12 mmHg, and the lab results show increasing WBC count and decreasing Hb, indicating a potential risk of septic shock.
* Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient's history of CAD increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
* Anxiety: The patient's anxiety can exacerbate respiratory failure and increase the risk of cardiac complications.
* Bleeding: The patient's decreased platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications.
* Kidney injury: The patient's increasing creatinine levels indicate potential kidney injury.

Based on the patient's condition, the ICU team should continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and medication levels closely to prevent potential complications and adjust the treatment plan as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, found to be
   hypotensive and hypoxemic.
   # Hypotension:  Multifactorial with septic shock from RLL pneumonia in
   the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.  Pt is also
   reporting diarrhea and may have developed c. diff though on flagyl.
   - F/U cultures
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Genlte IVF + wean pressors
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely [**1-22**] PNA with superimposed
   asthma flare.  Now intubated.
   - Continue albuterol MDI
   - Steroids started for asthma flare
   - Wean PS as tolerated
   # Diarrhea:  Pt reports 1 week of diarrhea.  Could be C. diff, although
   unlikely given recent flagyl.  Elevated WBC count yesterday prompted
   initiation of PO vanc.
   - Check C. diff
   - Continue PO vanc
 will d/c if c. diff neg x 2
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%:  EKG shows no acute ischemic
   changes, per Cardiology, just old massive anterior MI.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - Hold amiodarone, BB as hypotensive
   - Restart coumadin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, found to be
   hypotensive and hypoxemic.
   # Hypotension:  Multifactorial with septic shock from RLL pneumonia in
   the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.  Pt is also
   reporting diarrhea and may have developed c. diff though on flagyl.
   - F/U cultures
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Genlte IVF + wean pressors
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely [**1-22**] PNA with superimposed
   asthma flare.  Now intubated.
   - Continue albuterol MDI
   - Steroids started for asthma flare
   - Wean PS as tolerated
   # Diarrhea:  Pt reports 1 week of diarrhea.  Could be C. diff, although
   unlikely given recent flagyl.  Elevated WBC count yesterday prompted
   initiation of PO vanc.
   - Check C. diff
   - Continue PO vanc

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

* The patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant past medical history of recent massive NSTEMI, complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for three days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin.
* The patient presents with increasing shortness of breath (SOB) and diarrhea, and is found to be hypotensive and hypoxemic.
* The patient has a multifactorial presentation with septic shock from right lower lobe (RLL) pneumonia in the setting of poor left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) from recent massive NSTEMI.
* The patient is also experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia with superimposed asthma flare, and is intubated.
* The patient has diarrhea, which could be Clostridioides difficile (C. diff), although it is unlikely given recent flagyl treatment.
* The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with recent STEMI, and has an EF of 20%.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Continued septic shock and organ dysfunction
* Pneumonia progression and respiratory failure
* C. diff infection and diarrhea
* Cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure
* Hypotension and shock
* Respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation
* Infection and sepsis
* Organ failure and need for life-sustaining interventions

The patient's plan of care includes:

* F/u cultures
* Continue vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam
* Gentle IV fluid management and wean pressors
* Trend central venous pressure (CVP) and serial electrocardiograms (EKGs)
* Continue albuterol metered-dose inhaler (MDI) and steroids for asthma flare
* Wean positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) as tolerated
* Check for C. diff and continue PO vancomycin
* Serial CEs and EKGs
* Continue ASA, plavix, and high-dose atorvastatin
* Hold beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, aldactone, and lasix
* Hold amiodarone and restart coumadin
* ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and need for restraints review."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of septic shock, hypotensive, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has a significant past medical history of recent massive NSTEMI, three stents, cardiogenic shock requiring IABP, and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 37.6°C (99.7°F), Heart rate 76 bpm, Blood pressure 102/49 mmHg, Respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, SpO2 98%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 17 mmHg, Total IV fluid 2,349 mL, Urine output 768 mL.
* Respiratory support: Endotracheal tube, Ventilator mode PSV/SBT, FiO2 40%.
* Laboratory results: WBC 30.8, Hct 29.0, Plt 20.5, Cr 1.6, TropT 1.93, TCO2 23, Glucose 230.
* Imaging: CXR shows improving RLL consolidation and increased edema.

The patient's assessment and plan are as follows:

* Hypotension: Multifactorial with septic shock from RLL pneumonia in the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI. Plan: F/U cultures, continue vanc/cefepime/cipro, d/c c. diff coverage, gentle IVF, and wean pressors.
* Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely PNA with superimposed asthma flare. Plan: Continue albuterol MDI, steroids started for asthma flare, extubate today, wean O2 as tolerated, and check ABG.
* CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%. Plan: Continue ASA, plavix, high-dose atorvastatin, hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix.
* Afib: Currently in sinus. Plan: Hold amiodarone, BB as hypotensive, restart coumadin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure can worsen if not properly managed.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's poor EF and recent STEMI make her susceptible to cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's elevated Cr and decreased Hct suggest potential renal impairment.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diarrhea and lack of stool output may indicate gastrointestinal complications such as Clostridium difficile infection.
* Bloodstream infections: The patient's pending blood cultures and history of pneumonia increase the risk of bloodstream infections.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of recent massive NSTEMI, s/p 3 stents, complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring IABP for 3 days, and pneumonia treated with Flagyl and Levaquin. She presents from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, found to be hypotensive and hypoxemic. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is multifactorial, with septic shock from RLL pneumonia, poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI, and likely PNA with superimposed asthma flare.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock from RLL pneumonia may lead to organ dysfunction, including cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may worsen if not adequately managed, leading to respiratory acidosis, hypercapnia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's recent massive NSTEMI and poor EF may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, and potentially life-threatening complications such as cardiac tamponade or cardiogenic shock.
4. Infections: The patient's pneumonia and potential PNA may lead to secondary infections, including sepsis, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's diarrhea may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and potentially life-threatening complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's poor EF and potential hypoxia may lead to neurological complications, including cerebral edema, seizures, or stroke.
7. Renal Complications: The patient's septic shock and potential hypovolemia may lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
8. Hepatic Complications: The patient's septic shock and potential hypoxia may lead to liver dysfunction, including acute liver failure or chronic liver disease.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant past medical history of recent massive NSTEMI, s/p 3 stents, complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring IABP for 3 days and pneumonia treated with Flagyl and Levaquin. She presents from rehab with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea, found to be hypotensive and hypoxemic. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has a multifactorial hypotension, including septic shock from RLL pneumonia in the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI. She also has hypoxemic respiratory failure likely due to PNA with superimposed asthma flare.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, including septic shock from RLL pneumonia and poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI. The patient is at risk of further hypotension and potential organ dysfunction.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure is likely due to PNA with superimposed asthma flare. The patient is at risk of further respiratory decline and potential respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of recent massive NSTEMI and poor EF. She is at risk of further cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock from RLL pneumonia increases her risk of sepsis and potential organ dysfunction.
5. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of RLL pneumonia, which increases her risk of further respiratory complications and potential respiratory failure.
6. Asthma Flare: The patient has a diagnosis of asthma flare, which increases her risk of further respiratory complications and potential respiratory failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue vanc/zosyn and adjust doses based on improved creatinine.
2. D/c c. diff coverage given no stool output here.
3. Continue albuterol MDI and steroids for asthma flare.
4. Wean O2 as tolerated and check ABG.
5. Monitor patient's cardiac function and adjust medication as necessary.
6. Monitor patient's respiratory function and adjust ventilation settings as necessary.
7. Consider adding antibiotics for suspected PNA.
8. Consider adding corticosteroids for asthma flare.
9. Monitor patient's blood glucose levels and adjust medication as necessary.
10. Monitor patient's electrolyte levels and adjust medication as necessary."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 ANXIETY
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, in
   septic shock still requiring pressors. Intubated yesterday for
   increased work of breathing.
    # Hypotension:  Given distributive shock, o2 requirement, and CXR
   infiltrate, this is most likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs with any major hemodynamic changes
   - favor neo over levophed given recent MI and acutely depressed EF.
   - trial of fluids in effor to wean pressors, will be cautious given
   acutely depressed LVEF
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing: Likely
   [**1-22**] PNA with some contributiion from asthma given severe wheezing on
   exam.  .Tolerating SBT well this am.
   - extubate, BIPAP if flashes
   - steroidsx 5 days, MDIs
   # Diarrhea/Leukocytosis:  d/c empiric CDIFF covg given lack of
   diahrrea. f/u cdiff tox x2 when stools
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs for any hemodynamic changes
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   - favor neo over levophed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life
   means she will be therapeutic for a while)
   - therapeutic on coumadin but INR trending down rapidly; resumed
   coumadin yesterday

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU 10 days ago with a recent STEMI, treated with 3 stents and IABP for cardiogenic shock. She developed pneumonia, treated with Flagyl and Levaquin, and presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea. She was intubated yesterday for increased work of breathing. Current vital signs include a Tmax of 37.6°C, HR of 88 bpm, BP of 98/48 mmHg, and SpO2 of 99%. She is still dependent on neosulfonamide and unable to wean completely due to a CVP of 12 on average and borderline BP even on pressor support.

The patient has several medical conditions, including respiratory failure, anxiety, septic shock, coronary artery disease, and acute myocardial infarction. She has been treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin, and her leukocytosis is improving. She has also been prescribed steroids, MDIs, and cardiac enzymes are continually trending down.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's CVP is still elevated, and she is still requiring pressor support, which increases the risk of septic shock.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia and asthma, and she may require further treatment, such as bronchodilators and steroids.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes are continually trending down, but she still has an acutely depressed EF, which increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.
4. Diarrhea and leukocytosis: The patient's diarrhea and leukocytosis may be related to her pneumonia and antibiotic treatment, and further treatment may be necessary to manage these symptoms.
5. Coronary artery disease: The patient's coronary artery disease is not fully treated, and she may require further intervention to improve her cardiac function.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
2. Consider further treatment for her respiratory failure, such as bronchodilators and steroids.
3. Continue to monitor her cardiac enzymes and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
4. Consider further treatment for her diarrhea and leukocytosis, such as antibiotics and antidiarrheal medication.
5. Consider further intervention for her coronary artery disease, such as angioplasty or bypass surgery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, with
   septic shock, now extubated and not requiring pressors.
    # Hypotension:  Resolved.  Thought to be secondary to distributive
   shock, o2 requirement, in the setting of RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - favor neo over levophed if needed given recent MI and acutely
   depressed EF.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing:
   resolved.  Likely [**1-22**] PNA with some contributiion from asthma given
   severe wheezing on exam.
   - extubated, BIPAP if flashes
   - steroidsx 5 days, MDIs
day 5 of 5
   # Diarrhea/Leukocytosis:  resolved.
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix given just weaned off pressors this
   morning. Consider restarting BB in AM if BP tolerates.
   - favor neo over levophed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life
   means she will be therapeutic for a while)

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU 10 days ago with a recent STEMI, treated with 3 stents and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for cardiogenic shock. She was also treated for pneumonia with Flagyl and Levaquin. She presented to the hospital with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea, and was diagnosed with septic shock. She was extubated and weaned off pressors this morning.

The patient's current vital signs include:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.7°F)
* Heart rate: 88 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 98/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 inspirations per minute (ipm)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's physical examination is notable for bronchial breath sounds at the right base, diffuse expiratory wheezes, and a soft, non-tender abdomen.

Laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 30.8 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 29.0%
* Platelet count: 57 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 1.93 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.7 mmol/L
* LDH: 446 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.9 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Anxiety
* Septic shock
* Coronary artery disease (CAD), ischemic heart disease

The patient's plan includes:

* F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
* Vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin; leukocytosis improving
* Favor neo over levophed if needed, given recent MI and acutely depressed EF
* Cardiac enzymes continually trending down, suggesting that ACS is not contributing
* EKG relatively stable, some rate-dependent ST depressions inferiorly
* Continue ASA, plavix, and high-dose atorvastatin
* Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, and lasix, given just weaned off pressors this morning
* Favor neo over levophed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
* Given degree of akinesis/infarct, patient should maintain therapeutic INR and be bridged with heparin for INR < 2 to prevent LV thrombus

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure, worsening of pneumonia, and septic shock
* Cardiac complications, such as ventricular arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac tamponade
* Hemorrhagic complications, such as bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract or intracranial bleeding
* Neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, and encephalopathy
* Infection-related complications, such as bacteremia, sepsis, and organ failure
* Metabolic complications, such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances
* Cardiac enzymes continually trending down, suggesting that ACS is not contributing
* EKG relatively stable, some rate-dependent ST depressions inferiorly
* Given degree of akinesis/infarct, patient should maintain therapeutic INR and be bridged with heparin for INR < 2 to prevent LV thrombus"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health status:

The patient is a 24-hour old ICU patient who was successfully extubated but remains dependent on neopron and unable to wean completely. They are receiving a small dose of neopron and have a borderline blood pressure even with the use of a pressor. The patient's diuresis was held off due to a central venous pressure (CVP) of 12 mmHg on average.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.7°F) at its peak, and 35.6°C (96°F) currently
* Heart rate: 88 beats per minute (bpm) with a normal sinus rhythm
* Blood pressure: 98/48 mmHg, with a range of 92/46-116/70 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Weight: 72.1 kg (admission weight: 70 kg)

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 30.8, 26.2, 20.5, and 16.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 457 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.6, 1.4, 1.3, and 1.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 1.93, 1.48, 1.30, and 1.06 ng/mL
* Total CO2: 23 and 24 mmHg
* Glucose: 230, 206, 251, and 191 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Anxiety
* Septic shock
* Coronary artery disease (CAD, ischemic heart disease)

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is unclear.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: Pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, or other respiratory complications
* Septic shock: Organ failure, including kidney, liver, or cardiac failure
* Coronary artery disease: Myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, or other cardiac complications
* Anxiety: Agitation, delirium, or other psychiatric complications
* Acute kidney injury: Dialysis, electrolyte imbalance, or other kidney-related complications

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, in
   septic shock still requiring pressors. Intubated yesterday for
   increased work of breathing.
    # Hypotension:  Given distributive shock, o2 requirement, and CXR
   infiltrate, this is most likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs with any major hemodynamic changes
   - favor neo over levophed given recent MI and acutely depressed EF.
   - trial of fluids in effor to wean pressors, will be cautious given
   acutely depressed LVEF
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing: Likely
   [**1-22**] PNA with some contributiion from asthma given severe wheezing on
   exam.  .Tolerating SBT well this am.
   - extubate, BIPAP if flashes
   - steroidsx 5 days, MDIs
   # Diarrhea/Leukocytosis:  d/c empiric CDIFF covg given lack of
   diahrrea. f/u cdiff tox x2 when stools
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs for any hemodynamic changes
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   - favor neo over levophed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life
   means she will be therapeutic for a while)
   - therapeutic on coumadin but INR trending down rapidly; resumed
   coumadin yesterday

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, in
   septic shock still requiring pressors. Intubated yesterday for
   increased work of breathing.
    # Hypotension:  Given distributive shock, o2 requirement, and CXR
   infiltrate, this is most likely septic shock from RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - Trend CEs, serial EKGs with any major hemodynamic changes
   - favor neo over levophed given recent MI and acutely depressed EF.
   - trial of fluids in effor to wean pressors, will be cautious given
   acutely depressed LVEF
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing: Likely
   [**1-22**] PNA with some contributiion from asthma given severe wheezing on
   exam.  .Tolerating SBT well this am.
   - extubate, BIPAP if flashes
   - steroidsx 5 days, MDIs
   # Diarrhea/Leukocytosis:  d/c empiric CDIFF covg given lack of
   diahrrea. f/u cdiff tox x2 when stools
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.
   - Serial CEs, EKGs for any hemodynamic changes
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   - favor neo over levophed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted 10 days ago with a recent STEMI and was treated with three stents and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for cardiogenic shock. She had pneumonia treated with Flagyl and Levaquin, and was discharged from rehab with increasing shortness of breath and diarrhea. She was intubated yesterday for increased work of breathing. She is currently in the ICU with septic shock, respiratory failure, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 98/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her respiratory support includes a nasal cannula and a ventilator in PSV/SBT mode.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock may lead to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, hepatic dysfunction, or coagulopathy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypercapnic respiratory failure, or respiratory acidosis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's ACS may lead to cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrhythmias, or cardiac tamponade.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's septic shock may lead to neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, or encephalopathy.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diarrhea may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Renal complications: The patient's septic shock may lead to renal complications such as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or end-stage renal disease.
7. Hematological complications: The patient's septic shock may lead to hematological complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia, or hemolytic anemia.
8. Infections: The patient's septic shock may lead to secondary infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or skin infections.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's ACS may lead to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrest, cardiac tamponade, or aortic dissection.
10. Metabolic complications: The patient's septic shock may lead to metabolic complications such as hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, or hypophosphatemia."

   asthma flare.  Intubated [**10-23**].
   - Continue albuterol MDI
   - Steroids started for asthma flare
   - Extubate today
   - Wean O2 as tolerated and check ABG
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%:  EKG shows no acute ischemic
   changes, per Cardiology, just old massive anterior MI.
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - Hold amiodarone, BB as hypotensive

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including a recent massive NSTEMI, cardiogenic shock, and pneumonia. She is currently being treated for hypotension, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/57 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and is extubated.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and troponin-T levels, indicating ongoing inflammation and cardiac damage. Her cardiac enzymes are elevated, and her troponin-T levels are increasing. Her creatinine level is elevated, and her urine output is decreasing.

The patient's radiology results show improving infiltrates on her chest X-ray. Her microbiology results are negative for new culture data.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, with septic shock from right lower lobe pneumonia in the setting of poor left ventricular function from recent massive NSTEMI. The plan is to continue antibiotics, adjust doses based on improved creatinine, and wean pressors.

The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia with superimposed asthma flare. The plan is to continue albuterol MDI, steroids for asthma flare, and extubate today. Oxygen therapy will be weaned as tolerated, and ABG will be checked.

The patient's CAD, s/p recent STEMI, is being managed with ASA, plavix, and high-dose atorvastatin. Her atrial fibrillation is currently in sinus rhythm, and she will be restarted on coumadin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock from right lower lobe pneumonia is a significant risk factor for developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure is a risk factor for developing respiratory failure, which could lead to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent massive NSTEMI and poor left ventricular function make her at risk for cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and heart failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output increase her risk for developing renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and septic shock increase her risk for developing further infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant past medical history of recent massive NSTEMI, s/p 3 stents, complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring IABP for 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin. She presents from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, found to be hypotensive and hypoxemic.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamics: The patient's blood pressure is 101/57 mmHg, which is within the normal range. Her heart rate is 94 bpm, which is slightly elevated. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 16 mmHg, indicating normal filling pressures.
* Respiratory: The patient is on room air with a SpO2 of 99%. Her respiratory rate is 18 inspirations per minute, which is within the normal range. Her peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 6 cmH2O, and her positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 0 cmH2O.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a sinus rhythm, and her electrocardiogram (EKG) shows no acute ischemic changes.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is 1.6 mg/dL, which is within the normal range.
* Liver: The patient's liver enzymes are within normal limits.
* Neurological: The patient is attentive and responsive to verbal commands.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Septic shock from RLL pneumonia: The patient's hypotension and hypoxemia could be due to septic shock from the RLL pneumonia.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure could worsen if not properly managed.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's recent massive NSTEMI and poor left ventricular function (EF 20%) make her susceptible to cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diarrhea could be a sign of gastrointestinal complications such as small intestine obstruction or inflammatory bowel disease.
* Infection: The patient's pneumonia and recent antibiotic use make her susceptible to antibiotic-resistant infections.
* Thrombosis: The patient's recent history of IABP and poor left ventricular function make her susceptible to thrombosis.
* Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and recent history of IABP make her susceptible to bleeding.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the plan is to:

* Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro for septic shock and pneumonia.
* Off pressors since this am.
* Continue albuterol MDI for bronchodilation.
* Steroids started for asthma flare.
* Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin for CAD.
* Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix and restart when BP allows.
* Restart amiodarone, BB when BP allows.
* On coumadin for anticoagulation.
* Bowel regimen and full cardiac diet.
* ICU care including prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure, Pneumonia, and Asthma Flare. She has a history of recent massive NSTEMI, cardiogenic shock, and pneumonia treated with antibiotics. She was extubated and is currently on room air with nasal cannula oxygen. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/57 mmHg. She has a central venous pressure of 16 mmHg and a fluid balance of 266 mL. Her respiratory support includes a peak inspiratory pressure of 6 cmH2O, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 0 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase, indicating an ongoing inflammatory response. Her cardiac enzymes are elevated, indicating ongoing cardiac damage. Her kidney function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen level of 26 mg/dL.

The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotics for 8 days, continuing albuterol MDI for asthma, and starting steroids for asthma flare. She is to continue aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin for her cardiac condition. She is to restart beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and aldactone when her blood pressure allows. She is also to restart amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may progress, requiring reintubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to sepsis, septic shock, and multi-organ failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI and cardiogenic shock may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's impaired kidney function may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diarrhea may worsen, leading to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's recent cardiogenic shock may lead to neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, and encephalopathy.
7. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and recent hospitalization may lead to secondary infections, such as urinary tract infections, wound infections, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.
8. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may lead to bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and retroperitoneal bleeding."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 ANXIETY
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, with
   septic shock, reintubated overnight.
    # Hypotension:  Resolved.  Thought to be secondary to distributive
   shock, o2 requirement, in the setting of RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - favor neo over levophed if needed given recent MI and acutely
   depressed EF.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing:
   Decompensated overnight.  Likely [**1-22**] PNA, asthma, and ? fluid overload.
   CEs at that time negative. EKG unchanged from prior. PE unlikely given
   supratherapeutic on coumadin.
   - attempt to wean ventilation
   -continue broad spectrum vanc, cipro, cefepime day 6 of 8 for HA pna
   - day 4 of 5 of steroids for asthma
   -continue MDIs
   -lasix gtt with goal I/Os of -1L if BP tolerates
   -cycle Ces
   -Cardiology consult to eval whether hypoxia [**1-22**] cardiac etiology given
   recent STEMI
   -bilateral LENIs
if negative, consider CTA tomorrow if continues to be
   hypoxic
   # Diarrhea/Leukocytosis:  resolved.
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.  Patient had 20 beat run of VT
   yesterday evening after being intubated.
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix given just weaned off pressors this
   morning. Consider restarting BB in AM if BP tolerates.
   - favor neo over levophed if needed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   - f/u cardiology recs
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life
   means she will be therapeutic for a while)
   - supratherapeutic on coumadin
hold coumadin today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, with
   septic shock, reintubated overnight.
    # Hypotension:  Resolved.  Thought to be secondary to distributive
   shock, o2 requirement, in the setting of RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - favor neo over levophed if needed given recent MI and acutely
   depressed EF.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing:
   Decompensated overnight.  Likely [**1-22**] PNA, asthma, and ? fluid overload.
   CEs at that time negative. EKG unchanged from prior. PE unlikely given
   supratherapeutic on coumadin.
   - attempt to wean ventilation
   -continue broad spectrum vanc, cipro, cefepime day 6 of 8 for HA pna
   - day 4 of 5 of steroids for asthma
   -continue MDIs
   -lasix gtt with goal I/Os of -1L if BP tolerates
   -cycle Ces
   -Cardiology consult to eval whether hypoxia [**1-22**] cardiac etiology given
   recent STEMI
   -bilateral LENIs
if negative, consider CTA tomorrow if continues to be
   hypoxic
   # Diarrhea/Leukocytosis:  resolved.
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.  Patient had 20 beat run of VT
   yesterday evening after being intubated.
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix given just weaned off pressors this
   morning. Consider restarting BB in AM if BP tolerates.
   - favor neo over levophed if needed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   - f/u cardiology recs
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life
   means she will be therapeutic for a while)
   - supratherapeutic on coumadin

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, septic shock, and coronary artery disease (CAD) following a recent ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to hypoxemia and respiratory distress. The patient's initial presentation included hypotension, which was resolved with a 500cc bolus and did not require pressors.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* Heart rate: 80 bpm (70-125 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 108/60 mmHg (79-124/69 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14 inspirations per minute (10-35 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 26.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 355 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 180 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 1.06 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.7 mmol/L
* LDH: 446 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes a recent STEMI, 3 stents, and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for cardiogenic shock. She also has a history of pneumonia treated with Flagyl and Levaquin.

The patient's current medications include:

* Vancomycin
* Cefipime
* Ciprofloxacin
* Midazolam (Versed)
* Fentanyl
* Lorazepam (Ativan)
* Furosemide (Lasix)
* Aspirin
* Plavix
* High-dose atorvastatin
* Aldactone
* Lasix

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Weaning from ventilation
* Continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HA-PNA)
* Continuing steroids for asthma
* Maintaining therapeutic INR to prevent LV thrombus
* F/u cardiology recommendations
* Hold BB and ACEI due to hypotension
* Restart BB in the morning if BP tolerates
* Favor neo over levophed if needed

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure
* Sepsis
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Hypotension
* Fluid overload
* Diarrhea
* Leukocytosis
* Cardiac enzymes trending down suggesting ACS is not contributing
* VT
* AFib
* LV thrombus
* Pulmonary embolism

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medication regimen to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 ANXIETY
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, with
   septic shock, reintubated overnight.
    # Hypotension:  Resolved.  Thought to be secondary to distributive
   shock, o2 requirement, in the setting of RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - favor neo over levophed if needed given recent MI and acutely
   depressed EF.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing:
   Decompensated overnight.  Likely [**1-22**] PNA, asthma, and ? fluid overload.
   CEs at that time negative. EKG unchanged from prior.
   - attempt to wean ventilation
   - completed course of steroids
   -continue MDIs
   -consider trial of diuresis today, as pressure tolerates
   -cycle Ces
   -consider repeat echo
   # Diarrhea/Leukocytosis:  resolved.
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.  Patient had 20 beat run of VT
   yesterday evening after being intubated. No further evants like that
   overnight.
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix given just weaned off pressors this
   morning. Consider restarting BB in AM if BP tolerates.
   - favor neo over levophed if needed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life
   means she will be therapeutic for a while)
   - therapeutic on coumadin but INR trending down rapidly; resumed

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications that can arise:

Patient Summary:

* The patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, septic shock, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) following a recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
* She has a history of pneumonia, treated with antibiotics, and has been intubated due to hypoxemia and respiratory distress.
* She has a depressed ejection fraction (EF) of 20% and has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to being intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has septic shock and is at risk of developing further complications, such as organ failure, if not adequately managed.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a depressed EF and has undergone PCI with stenting. She is at risk of developing cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient has respiratory failure and is at risk of developing further complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), if not adequately managed.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has diarrhea and is at risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding, especially with the use of anticoagulants.
6. Renal complications: The patient is at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) due to sepsis, hypotension, and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
7. Neurological complications: The patient is at risk of developing neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, and encephalopathy, especially with the use of anticoagulants and antibiotics.

Management Plan:

1. Continue to manage the patient's septic shock with fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and antibiotics.
2. Wean the patient off the ventilator and consider a trial of diuresis to manage her respiratory failure.
3. Continue to manage the patient's cardiac complications with anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and beta-blockers.
4. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal function and manage any gastrointestinal bleeding with proton pump inhibitors and anticoagulants.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and manage any AKI with diuretics and hemodialysis.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological function and manage any neurological complications with anticonvulsants and sedatives.

Overall, the patient is at risk of developing multiple medical complications and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these complications."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 ANXIETY
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, with
   septic shock, reintubated overnight.
    # Hypotension:  Resolved.  Thought to be secondary to distributive
   shock, o2 requirement, in the setting of RLL pneumonia poorly
   compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving
   - favor neo over levophed if needed given recent MI and acutely
   depressed EF.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing:
   Decompensated overnight.  Likely [**1-22**] PNA, asthma, and ? fluid overload.
   CEs at that time negative. EKG unchanged from prior. PE unlikely given
   supratherapeutic on coumadin.
   - attempt to wean ventilation
   -continue broad spectrum vanc, cipro, cefepime day 6 of 8 for HA pna
   - day 4 of 5 of steroids for asthma
   -continue MDIs
   -lasix gtt with goal I/Os of -1L if BP tolerates
   -cycle Ces
   -Cardiology consult to eval whether hypoxia [**1-22**] cardiac etiology given
   recent STEMI
   -bilateral LENIs
if negative, consider CTA tomorrow if continues to be
   hypoxic
   # Diarrhea/Leukocytosis:  resolved.
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.  Patient had 20 beat run of VT
   yesterday evening after being intubated.
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, lasix given just weaned off pressors this
   morning. Consider restarting BB in AM if BP tolerates.
   - favor neo over levophed if needed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   - f/u cardiology recs
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as hypotensive, resume amio soon (although long half-life
   means she will be therapeutic for a while)
   - supratherapeutic on coumadin
hold coumadin today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female who presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and was found to have respiratory failure, acute anxiety, septic shock, and coronary artery disease (CAD) with a recent myocardial infarction (STEMI). She has been treated with antibiotics, steroids, and cardiac medications, and is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her cardiac enzymes are trending down, suggesting that the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is not contributing to her hypoxemia. She has a history of pneumonia, asthma, and CAD, and is currently being treated for septic shock and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a major concern, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not managed properly. The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 343, which is concerning for hypoxemia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and management. There is a risk of further deterioration if not managed properly.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's recent STEMI and CAD increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is a potential source of sepsis and respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not managed properly.
5. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea is a potential source of electrolyte imbalance and dehydration, and there is a risk of further complications if not managed properly.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is a potential source of sepsis and respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further complications if not managed properly.
7. Cardiac Enzyme Elevation: The patient's cardiac enzyme elevation is a potential source of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest.
8. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is a potential source of organ dysfunction and failure, and there is a risk of further complications if not managed properly.
9. Hypoxemia: The patient's hypoxemia is a potential source of respiratory failure and cardiac complications, and there is a risk of further complications if not managed properly.
10. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP, which is a potential source of sepsis and respiratory failure.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath. The patient was intubated due to hypoxemia and respiratory distress and is currently receiving invasive ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 80 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 108/60 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97% on a FiO2 of 35%.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, and mild thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 355 K/uL. The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits, and the patient's electrolyte levels are normal.

The patient's imaging studies show no signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's diagnosis is respiratory failure, acute, not ARDS, and the patient is also diagnosed with anxiety, septic shock, and coronary artery disease (CAD).

The patient is receiving ICU care, including invasive ventilation, vasopressors, and antibiotics. The patient is also receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to the invasive ventilation and prolonged stay in the ICU.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to the prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of invasive ventilation.
3. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis due to the presence of a central line and the use of vasopressors.
4. ARDS: Although the patient's imaging studies do not show signs of ARDS, the patient is at risk for developing ARDS due to the prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of invasive ventilation.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient has a diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is at risk for developing cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
6. Renal failure: The patient is at risk for developing renal failure due to the prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of vasopressors.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for developing gastrointestinal complications, such as stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding, due to the prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of vasopressors."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, septic shock, and coronary artery disease. She has a history of recent STEMI, treated with stents and IABP, and has undergone cardiogenic shock. She was reintubated overnight due to increasing SOB and diarrhea.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. She has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 343, indicating hypoxemic respiratory failure. Her respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and her SpO2 is 97%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, and her blood pressure is 108/60 mmHg. She has a history of coronary artery disease, and her cardiac enzymes are trending down, suggesting that the acute coronary syndrome is not contributing to her current condition.
* Neurological: The patient's neurological status is stable, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 25 mg/dL.
* Hematological: The patient's white blood cell count is 26.2 K/uL, and her platelet count is 355 K/uL.
* Infectious: The patient has a history of pneumonia, which was treated with antibiotics. She has a fever of 36.5°C, and her WBC count is 26.2 K/uL.
* Medications: The patient is receiving various medications, including vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin, as well as midazolam, fentanyl, and lorazepam.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure can worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or cardiac arrest.
* Septic shock: The patient's septic shock can worsen, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
* Coronary artery disease: The patient's coronary artery disease can worsen, leading to further cardiac complications.
* Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia can worsen, leading to respiratory failure or septic shock.
* Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea can worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances or dehydration.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac arrhythmias can worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or cardiac failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Respiratory support: The patient will continue to receive invasive ventilation and oxygen therapy.
* Antibiotics: The patient will continue to receive antibiotics to treat her pneumonia.
* Cardiovascular support: The patient will receive cardiovascular support, including vasopressors and inotropes, as needed.
* Pain management: The patient will receive pain management, including opioids and non-opioid analgesics, as needed.
* Fluid management: The patient will receive fluid management, including IV fluids and diuretics, as needed.
* Blood pressure management: The patient will receive blood pressure management, including vasopressors and antihypertensives, as needed.
* Electrolyte management: The patient will receive electrolyte management, including potassium and magnesium supplementation, as needed.
* Renal support: The patient will receive renal support, including dialysis, if necessary.
* Nutritional support: The patient will receive nutritional support, including total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or enteral nutrition, as needed.
* Cardiovascular rehabilitation: The patient will receive cardiovascular rehabilitation, including cardiac rehabilitation and physical therapy, as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, septic shock, and coronary artery disease (CAD) following a recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She was initially treated with invasive ventilation, antibiotics, and vasopressors. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypotension, hypoxemic respiratory failure, diarrhea, and leukocytosis. She has been receiving various medications, including anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and beta blockers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is ongoing, and there is a risk of further organ dysfunction.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's CAD and recent STEMI increase her risk of cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and heart failure.
4. GI complications: The patient's diarrhea and leukocytosis may be indicative of a gastrointestinal infection, which could worsen her condition.
5. Renal complications: The patient's septic shock and decreased cardiac output may lead to acute kidney injury (AKI).
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypotension and vasopressor dependence increase her risk of hemodynamic instability, including cardiac arrest.
7. Infectious complications: The patient's septic shock and pneumonia increase her risk of developing further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's CAD and recent STEMI increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and heart failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation settings as necessary.
2. Continue antibiotics and vasopressors as prescribed.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust medications as necessary.
4. Consider further evaluation and treatment of the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust fluid management as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status closely and adjust vasopressors as necessary.
7. Consider further evaluation and treatment of the patient's infectious symptoms.
8. Consider further evaluation and treatment of the patient's cardiovascular symptoms."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath. They were intubated due to hypoxemia and respiratory distress, and are currently receiving invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, septic shock, and acute respiratory failure. They are receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and vasopressors.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 108/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Their respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 443 mL. However, they do have a run of ventricular tachycardia, which was resolved with a 500cc bolus of fluids.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with a white blood cell count of 26.2 K/uL and a lactate level of 1.7 mmol/L. Their cardiac enzymes are also elevated, with a troponin level of 1.06 ng/mL and a CK-MB level of 73 IU/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure could worsen, leading to increased respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis could progress, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's coronary artery disease and elevated cardiac enzymes could lead to cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Neurologic complications: The patient's sepsis and hypotension could lead to neurologic complications, such as cerebral edema or seizures.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) could increase their risk of bleeding complications.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of Hypoxic Respiratory Failure due to Pneumonia (HCAP PNA) and Asthma Flare. She has a significant past medical history of recent massive Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) at 10 days ago, which complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) for 3 days and pneumonia treated with Flagyl and Levaquin.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tcurrent 35.9°C, HR 85 bpm, BP 105/58 mmHg, RR 16 inspirations per minute, SpO2 98%.
* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a FiO2 of 35%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a poor ejection fraction (EF) of 20% due to recent massive anterior myocardial infarction.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has a central venous catheter and an arterial line in place.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,816 mL of fluids and has a total output of 1,780 mL.
* Laboratory results: The patient's WBC count is 26.2 K/uL, Hct is 29.1%, and Plt is 355 K/uL. Her troponin-T level is 1.06 ng/mL, and her TCO2 level is 26 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further, leading to hypoxemic respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's poor ejection fraction and history of cardiogenic shock increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, or cardiogenic shock.
3. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and septic shock increase the risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diarrhea and history of recent massive NSTEMI increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
5. Thromboembolic events: The patient's history of recent cardiogenic shock and pneumonia increase the risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the plan of care should focus on:

1. Continuing respiratory support with CPAP/PSV ventilation and adjusting FiO2 as needed.
2. Monitoring the patient's cardiovascular status closely and adjusting treatment accordingly.
3. Managing the patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels to prevent complications.
4. Continuously monitoring the patient's laboratory results and adjusting treatment accordingly.
5. Considering the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis.
6. Maintaining the patient's glycemic control and nutrition.
7. Considering the use of steroids for asthma flare and adjusting treatment accordingly.
8. Continuing antibiotics for pneumonia and adjusting treatment accordingly.
9. Monitoring the patient's mental status and adjusting treatment accordingly.
10. Considering the use of sedatives and analgesics to manage the patient's pain and anxiety."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with diarrhea, hypotension and respiratory distress
   progressing into acute respiratory failure- dx
d with HAP PNA/asthma
   flare. Extubated [**10-24**] and doing well on 4 L NC until [**10-25**] pm when she
   was reintubated.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Initially [**1-22**] PNA with superimposed
   asthma flare.  Extubated [**10-24**].  Developed acute respiratory distress
   11/5pm requiring re-intubation for obtundation and mottled appearance.
   Unclear etiology (VBG 4.32/42 and sats in high 90s on 4L prior to
   obtundation), but likely due to volume status and large anxiety
   component.  Now looks extubatable, but hesitant given unclear event
   that led to reintubation.  Differential includes pulmonary edema,
   anxiety, oversedation with ativan, HAP, PE, and acute bronchspasm.
   - Continue albuterol MDI; on steroids for asthma flare
 Day [**3-25**]
   - Lasix gtt to diuresis given borderline BP
   - Continue abx for HAP
   - Versed gtt for anxiety
   - LE dopplers to r/o DVT as PE is consideration for acute episode last
   pm
   - SBT today, RSBI 37
 Decrease PS 5/5 and plan to extubate tomorrow
   - Cardiology consult
   # Hypotension:  Multifactorial with septic shock from RLL pneumonia in
   the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro
 Day [**5-28**]
   - Off pressors since [**10-25**] am
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%:  EKG shows no acute ischemic
   changes, per Cardiology, just old massive anterior MI.
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, and aldactone; restart when BP allows
   - Cardiology consult to evaluate for cardaic etiology of events last pm
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - Restart amiodarone, BB when BP allows
   - On coumadin
 hold today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with diarrhea, hypotension and respiratory distress
   progressing into acute respiratory failure- dx
d with HAP PNA/asthma
   flare. Extubated [**10-24**] and doing well on 4 L NC until [**10-25**] pm when she
   was reintubated.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Initially [**1-22**] PNA with superimposed
   asthma flare.  Extubated [**10-24**].  Developed acute respiratory distress
   11/5pm requiring re-intubation for obtundation and mottled appearance.
   Unclear etiology (VBG 4.32/42 and sats in high 90s on 4L prior to
   obtundation), but likely due to volume status and large anxiety
   component.  Now looks extubatable, but hesitant given unclear event
   that led to reintubation.  Differential includes pulmonary edema,
   anxiety, oversedation with ativan, HAP, PE, and acute bronchspasm.
   - Continue albuterol MDI; on steroids for asthma flare
 Day [**3-25**]
   - Lasix gtt to diuresis given borderline BP
   - Continue abx for HAP
   - Versed gtt for anxiety
   - LE dopplers to r/o DVT as PE is consideration for acute episode last
   pm
   - SBT today, RSBI 37
 Decrease PS 5/5 and plan to extubate tomorrow
   - Cardiology consult
   # Hypotension:  Multifactorial with septic shock from RLL pneumonia in
   the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of recent massive NSTEMI, s/p 3 stents, and complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring IABP for 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin. She presents from rehab with diarrhea, hypotension, and respiratory distress progressing into acute respiratory failure, diagnosed with HAP and asthma flare. She was initially extubated but required reintubation due to acute respiratory distress, likely caused by volume status, anxiety, and unclear etiology. The patient's condition is critical, with hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypotension, and cardiac dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, and current symptoms of respiratory distress and hypoxia may indicate a worsening of the infection.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of NSTEMI, and her current condition may be complicated by cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac dysfunction.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which may be caused by pneumonia, asthma flare, or other respiratory complications such as pulmonary edema or acute bronchospasm.
4. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and respiratory distress may indicate sepsis, particularly given her history of pneumonia and cardiogenic shock.
5. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to her immobility and underlying medical conditions, and the use of anticoagulation therapy.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has diarrhea, which may be caused by antibiotics, infection, or other gastrointestinal complications.
7. Anxiety and Sedation: The patient's anxiety and sedation requirements may indicate a need for further psychological support and sedation management.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias may be complicated by cardiovascular events such as cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock.

These potential medical complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's condition to prevent further complications and improve her outcome."

s note
   as outlined above, and would add: 77 yo female with recent STEMI
   requiring IABP/stent, admitted with resp distress/acute respiratory
   failure from HAP and asthma flare. Extubated morning of [**10-24**] well until
   yesterday evening. Preceding events prior to acute decompensation
   mostly notable for gradual sinus tachycardia and pt
s complaints of
   breathlessness, though no change in oxygen requirement or PE.
   Reportedly with diffuse wheezing immediately pre-intubation, lung exam
   clear today. Serial CXR
s mostly identify ongoing fluid overload though
   not especially different  yesterday. Ventilator requirements were
   rapidly weaned and she currently looks comfortable on PSV.
   CXR is not suggestive of a new HAP, airway pathophysiology feasible but
   not highly c/w the improvt in lung exam, in the absence of additional
   intervention. Recent decompensation could be from volume overload as
   her borderline BP
s have prevented us from diuresing her before.
   As pt finally off pressors, will begin lasix gtt to diurese, have
   cardiology consult team see her. Plan SBT early tomorrow with hopeful
   plans to extubate early in the day. If she can tolerate without this
   aggravating her anxiety, early NIPPV might be considered, either
   immediately following extubation or otherwise with ABG drawn later in
   the day.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 40 minutes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with diarrhea, hypotension and respiratory distress
   progressing into acute respiratory failure- dx
d with HAP PNA/asthma
   flare. Extubated [**10-24**] and doing well on 4 L NC until [**10-25**] pm when she
   was reintubated.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Initially [**1-22**] PNA with superimposed
   asthma flare.  Extubated [**10-24**].  Developed acute respiratory distress
   11/5pm requiring re-intubation for obtundation and mottled appearance.
   Unclear etiology (VBG 4.32/42 and sats in high 90s on 4L prior to
   obtundation), but likely due to volume status and large anxiety
   component.  Now looks extubatable, but hesitant given unclear event
   that led to reintubation.  Differential includes pulmonary edema,
   anxiety, oversedation with ativan, HAP, PE, and acute bronchspasm.
   - Continue albuterol MDI; on steroids for asthma flare
 Day [**3-25**]
   - Lasix gtt to diuresis given borderline BP
   - Continue abx for HAP
   - Versed gtt for anxiety
   - LE dopplers to r/o DVT as PE is consideration for acute episode last
   pm
   - SBT today, RSBI 37
 Decrease PS 5/5 and plan to extubate tomorrow
   - Cardiology consult
   # Hypotension:  Multifactorial with septic shock from RLL pneumonia in
   the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro
 Day [**5-28**]
   - Off pressors since [**10-25**] am
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%:  EKG shows no acute ischemic

s note
   as outlined above, and would add: 77 yo female with recent STEMI
   requiring IABP/stent, admitted with resp distress/acute respiratory
   failure from HAP and asthma flare. Extubated morning of [**10-24**] well until
   yesterday evening. Preceding events prior to acute decompensation
   mostly notable for gradual sinus tachycardia and pt
s complaints of
   breathlessness, though no change in oxygen requirement or PE.
   Reportedly with diffuse wheezing immediately pre-intubation, lung exam
   clear today. Serial CXR
s mostly identify ongoing fluid overload though
   not especially different  yesterday. Ventilator requirements were
   rapidly weaned and she currently looks comfortable on PSV.
   CXR is not suggestive of a new HAP, airway pathophysiology feasible but
   not highly c/w the improvt in lung exam, in the absence of additional
   intervention. Recent decompensation could be from volume overload as
   her borderline BP
s have prevented us from diuresing her before.
   As pt finally off pressors, will begin lasix gtt to diurese, have
   cardiology consult team see her. Plan SBT early tomorrow with hopeful
   plans to extubate early in the day. If she can tolerate without this
   aggravating her anxiety, early NIPPV might be considered, either
   immediately following extubation or otherwise with ABG drawn later in
   the day.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 40 minutes.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant medical history, including a recent massive NSTEMI, s/p 3 stents, and complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring IABP and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin. She presents with diarrhea, hypotension, and respiratory distress, progressing into acute respiratory failure, diagnosed with HAP/PNA/asthma flare.

The patient was initially extubated but required reintubation due to acute respiratory distress, which is unclear in etiology, but likely related to volume status, anxiety, and possible pulmonary edema, asthma flare, or acute bronchospasm.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated, and her respiratory status is improving, but she is still at risk for respiratory complications.
2. Hypotension: The patient has multifactorial hypotension due to septic shock from RLL pneumonia and poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has CAD, s/p recent STEMI, with an EF of 20%. She is on ASA, plavix, and high-dose atorvastatin and has a cardiology consult to evaluate for cardiac etiology of recent events.
4. Afib: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm but has a history of Afib and is on coumadin.
5. Bowel regimen: The patient is NPO and has a bowel regimen.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory failure, which could lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation, respiratory arrest, or even death.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is unstable, and further complications could arise, such as cardiac arrest, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
3. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock could worsen, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema could worsen, leading to respiratory failure or cardiac complications.
5. Bowel obstruction: The patient's bowel regimen could lead to bowel obstruction, which could be life-threatening.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continue albuterol MDI and steroids for asthma flare.
2. Continue antibiotics for HAP.
3. Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro for septic shock.
4. Start lasix gtt to diurese.
5. Cardiology consult to evaluate for cardiac etiology of recent events.
6. Plan SBT early tomorrow with hopeful plans to extubate early in the day.
7. Consider early NIPPV if the patient can tolerate it without aggravating her anxiety.

The patient is critically ill, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and improve her condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with diarrhea, hypotension and respiratory distress
   progressing into acute respiratory failure- dx
d with HAP PNA/asthma
   flare. Extubated [**10-24**] and doing well on 4 L NC until [**10-25**] pm when she
   was reintubated.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Initially [**1-22**] PNA with superimposed
   asthma flare.  Extubated [**10-24**].  Developed acute respiratory distress
   11/5pm requiring re-intubation for obtundation and mottled appearance.
   Unclear etiology (VBG 4.32/42 and sats in high 90s on 4L prior to
   obtundation), but likely due to volume status and large anxiety
   component.  Now looks extubatable, but hesitant given unclear event
   that led to reintubation.  Differential includes pulmonary edema,
   anxiety, oversedation with ativan, HAP, PE, and acute bronchspasm.
   - Continue albuterol MDI; on steroids for asthma flare
 Day [**3-25**]
   - Lasix gtt to diuresis given borderline BP
   - Continue abx for HAP
   - Versed gtt for anxiety
   - LE dopplers to r/o DVT as PE is consideration for acute episode last
   pm
   - SBT today, RSBI 37
 Decrease PS 5/5 and possible extubation later
   based on results of above
   - Cardiology consult
   # Hypotension:  Multifactorial with septic shock from RLL pneumonia in
   the setting of poor EF from recent massive NSTEMI.
   - Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro
 Day [**5-28**]
   - Off pressors since [**10-25**] am
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%:  EKG shows no acute ischemic
   changes, per Cardiology, just old massive anterior MI.
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, and aldactone; restart when BP allows
   - Cardiology consult to evaluate for cardaic etiology of events last pm
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - Restart amiodarone, BB when BP allows
   - On coumadin
 hold today

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a significant past medical history, including a recent massive non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), who presents with respiratory distress, hypotension, and diarrhea. She was initially extubated but reintubated due to acute respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypoxemic respiratory failure
* Hypotension
* Diarrhea
* Acute respiratory distress
* Unclear etiology of reintubation, but likely due to volume status, anxiety, and possible oversedation

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, and sedatives, and has undergone several interventions, including insertion of an arterial line and prophylactic anticoagulation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Pulmonary edema
* Anxiety
* Oversedation with ativan
* HAP (Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia)
* PE (Pulmonary Embolism)
* Acute bronchospasm

The patient's lab results indicate:

* WBC count: 26.2-13.1 K/uL
* Hct: 29.1-26.2%
* Plt: 522-355 K/uL
* Cr: 1.3-1.2 mg/dL
* TropT: 1.06-0.60 ng/mL
* TCO2: 26-28 mmHg
* Glucose: 180-43 mg/dL
* Other lab results indicate potential kidney and liver dysfunction

The patient's imaging studies, including CXR, show worsening pulmonary edema.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue antibiotics for HAP
* Continue diuretics for fluid management
* Continue sedatives for anxiety management
* Perform serial blood cultures and imaging studies to monitor for sepsis and other complications
* Consider cardiology consult to evaluate for cardiac etiology of events
* Monitor for signs of septic shock and adjust treatment accordingly
* Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prevention measures

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is 77 yo female with PMHx sig. for recent massive NSTEMI at OSH
   10 days ago, s/p 3 stents complicated by cardiogenic shock requiring
   IABP x 3 days and pneumonia treated with flagyl and levaquin, who
   presents from rehab with diarrhea, hypotension and respiratory distress
   progressing into acute respiratory failure- dx
d with HAP PNA/asthma
   flare. Extubated [**10-24**] and doing well on 4 L NC until [**10-25**] pm when she
   was reintubated.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Initially [**1-22**] PNA with superimposed
   asthma flare.  Extubated [**10-24**].  Developed acute respiratory distress
   11/5pm requiring re-intubation for obtundation and mottled appearance.
   Unclear etiology (VBG 4.32/42 and sats in high 90s on 4L prior to
   obtundation), but likely due to volume status and large anxiety
   component.  Now looks extubatable, but hesitant given unclear event
   that led to reintubation.  Differential includes pulmonary edema,
   anxiety, oversedation with ativan, HAP, PE, and acute bronchspasm.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 77-year-old female who has a significant past medical history, including a recent massive NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction) 10 days ago, followed by cardiogenic shock, and pneumonia treated with antibiotics. She was extubated on day 10-24 but was reintubated on day 10-25 due to acute respiratory distress and obtundation. The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple potential medical complications.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 450-500 mL.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on 35% FiO2.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 105/58 mmHg, which is borderline.
4. Cardiac status: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 20% due to recent massive anterior myocardial infarction.
5. Pulmonary edema: The patient has worsening pulmonary edema, as evident from the CXR (chest X-ray).
6. Anxiety: The patient has a significant anxiety component, which may contribute to her respiratory distress.
7. Diarrhea: The patient has diarrhea, which may be related to her recent antibiotics.
8. Sedation: The patient is sedated with midazolam and fentanyl.

The patient's differential diagnosis includes:

1. Pulmonary edema
2. Anxiety
3. Oversedation with ativan
4. HAP (healthcare-associated pneumonia)
5. PE (pulmonary embolism)
6. Acute bronchospasm

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue albuterol MDI for asthma flare
2. Continue antibiotics for HAP
3. Versed gtt for anxiety
4. LE dopplers to rule out DVT (deep vein thrombosis) as PE is a consideration
5. SBT (spontaneous breathing trial) today with RSBI 37
6. Decrease PS (positive end-expiratory pressure) to 5/5 and plan to extubate tomorrow
7. Cardiology consult
8. Continue vanc/cefepime/cipro
9. Off pressors since 10-25 am
10. Hold BB, ACEI, and aldactone; restart when BP allows
11. Cardiology consult to evaluate for cardiac etiology of events last pm
12. Restart amiodarone, BB when BP allows
13. On coumadin, hold today and decrease dose (INR 3.7)

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure
2. Cardiac arrhythmias
3. Sepsis
4. Pulmonary embolism
5. Deep vein thrombosis
6. Bowel obstruction
7. Malnutrition
8. Infection

The patient's overall condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential complications and improve her clinical outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, septic shock, and coronary artery disease (CAD) following a recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia.

The patient's 24-hour events include:

* Ultrasound of the bilateral legs, which showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Cardiology consultation, which agreed that congestive heart failure (CHF) was contributing to her respiratory distress
* Start of Lasix gtt, which diuresed well
* Plan for extubation this morning if the patient is doing well

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.9°C (96.6°F)
* Heart rate: 81 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 113/58 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 inspirations per minute (ins/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.7 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL
* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.60 ng/mL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 16.5 mmol/L
* Serum creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na+ 138 mmol/L, K+ 4.4 mmol/L, Cl- 103 mmol/L
* Glucose: 243 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is:

* Peripheral vascular: Not assessed
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Responds to stimuli, but movement, tone, and reflexes are not assessed

The patient's respiratory support is:

* Oxygen delivery device: Endotracheal tube
* Ventilator mode: CPAP/PSV
* Tidal volume (VT): 481 mL
* Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP): 5 cmH2O
* Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2): 35%

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Hypotension: Resolved, but may recur if septic shock persists
* Hypoxemic respiratory failure: May worsen if not treated
* Increased work of breathing: May lead to respiratory failure if not managed
* Diarrhea: Resolved, but may recur if not treated
* Leukocytosis: Resolved, but may recur if infection persists
* Cardiac enzymes: Continually trending down, suggesting that acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is not contributing
* Electrolyte imbalance: May lead to arrhythmias or other complications if not managed
* Septic shock: May recur if not treated
* Pneumonia: May worsen if not treated
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): May occur if not treated with prophylaxis
* Pulmonary embolism (PE): May occur if not treated with prophylaxis

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia
* Continue steroids for asthma
* Continue MDIs
* Attempt to wean ventilation
* Continue Lasix gtt with goal I/Os of -1L if blood pressure tolerates
* Cycle ces
* Cardiology consult to evaluate whether hypoxia is due to cardiac etiology
* Bilateral LENIs
* If negative, consider CTA tomorrow if continues to be hypoxic
* Continue ASA, plavix, and high-dose atorvastatin
* Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, and Lasix given just weaned off pressors this morning
* Favor neo over levophed if needed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
* Given degree of akinesis/infarct, patient should maintain therapeutic INR and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
* F/u cardiology recs
* Hold coumadin today
* IVFs/replete lytes prn/NPO
* H2RA, supratherapeutic INR, bowel regimen

   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, with
   septic shock, reintubated overnight.
    # Sepsis/Hypotension:  Resolved.  Thought to be secondary to
   distributive shock, o2 requirement, in the setting of RLL pneumonia
   poorly compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving, but now worsening again
   (cdiff vs steroids?)
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing:
   Decompensated overnight.  Likely [**1-22**] PNA, asthma, and ? fluid overload.
   CEs at that time negative. EKG unchanged from prior.
   -continue broad spectrum vanc, cipro, cefepime day 7 of 8 for HA pna;
   check vanco level in AM

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old female admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute, not ARDS. She has a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease, and is currently receiving treatment for septic shock. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 113/58 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on 35% FiO2.

The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefipime, and ciprofloxacin, and is currently receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management. She is also receiving lasix for diuresis.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 29 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with a potassium level of 4.4 mEq/L and a magnesium level of 2.0 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to her prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is a serious complication that requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL and BUN level of 29 mg/dL suggest acute kidney injury, which may require dialysis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a serious complication that requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment.
5. Coronary artery disease: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and ischemic heart disease increases her risk for cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is a serious complication that requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment.
7. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's prolonged immobility and respiratory failure increase her risk for pulmonary embolism.
8. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's prolonged hypoxia and respiratory failure increase her risk for anoxic brain injury.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy as prescribed.
4. Monitor the patient's laboratory results closely and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Consider dialysis for acute kidney injury.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Consider anticoagulation therapy to prevent pulmonary embolism.
8. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and adjust treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male who was recently admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and volume overload following a NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction). He had a large STEMI (ST elevation myocardial infarction) at OSH (out-of-hospital setting) two weeks prior, which was treated with PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) to the LAD (left anterior descending) artery. He also required IABP (intra-aortic balloon pump) due to cardiogenic shock. The patient's hospital course was complicated by PNA (pneumonia) and he presented with increasing SOB (shortness of breath), diarrhea, and hypotension.

The patient was intubated for worsening respiratory distress, but was extubated and then re-intubated due to acute respiratory distress. He is currently re-extubated to nasal cannula with continued volume overload.

The patient's current vital signs include:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.5°F)
* Heart rate: 98 bpm
* Blood pressure: 125/65 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 93%
* Oxygen delivery device: nasal cannula
* Ventilator mode: PSV/SBT
* FiO2: 35%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.7-16.5 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 25.5-27.6%
* Platelet count: 410-16.5 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.1-1.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.60 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.7 mmol/L
* LDH: 446 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.6 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) to be considered
* Diuresis to be initiated to reduce volume overload
* ABG (arterial blood gas) analysis to be performed
* Resend urine and stool cultures
* Vanc level to be checked and increased if necessary
* C Diff (Clostridium difficile) testing to be performed if stool is positive
* PNA treatment to be continued
* Asthma treatment to be completed
* Coumadin to be held due to elevated INR (international normalized ratio)

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure
* Volume overload
* PNA
* Cardiac complications (e.g. cardiogenic shock, heart failure)
* Infection (e.g. sepsis)
* Bleeding (e.g. gastrointestinal bleeding)
* Electrolyte imbalances (e.g. hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia)
* Acid-base disturbances (e.g. metabolic acidosis)
* Renal failure
* Hepatic failure
* Coagulopathy (e.g. disseminated intravascular coagulation)"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, volume overload, and a recent large NSTEMI. She had a PCI to the LAD and required IABP due to cardiogenic shock. She was extubated earlier this week but developed acute respiratory distress and required re-intubation. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 125/65 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%. She is receiving furosemide (Lasix) and has a volume overload.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and she may require further respiratory support, such as non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).
2. Volume overload: The patient's volume overload is a risk factor for respiratory failure and may require further diuresis to manage.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be investigated and treated promptly.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent NSTEMI and cardiogenic shock may put her at risk for further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diarrhea and abdominal pain may indicate a gastrointestinal infection or inflammatory process, which needs to be investigated and treated promptly.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and decreased responsiveness may indicate a neurological complication, such as sepsis or encephalopathy, which needs to be investigated and treated promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide respiratory support as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's volume overload with diuresis and monitor her response to treatment.
3. Investigate the patient's leukocytosis and treat any underlying infection promptly.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and provide cardiac support as needed.
5. Investigate the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and treat any underlying infection or inflammatory process promptly.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status and provide neurological support as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, respiratory failure, and coronary artery disease (CAD) following a recent STEMI. She has a history of pneumonia, treated with flagyl and levaquin, and has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for HAP. She has also been diagnosed with CAD, with 80% lesions in the mid and distal LAD, and 90% circumflex lesion, which were not intervened upon during her recent STEMI. The patient's condition has been complicated by leukocytosis, with a WBC count of 21.3, and she has been experiencing abdominal cramping and stool output after broad-spectrum antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, and blood pressure of 137/75 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on 2L nasal cannula. Her lung examination reveals bilateral crackles at the bases.

The patient's laboratory results show a WBC count of 21.3, with a rising trend over the past two days. Her hemoglobin is 9.4 g/dL, and her platelet count is 421 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for CAD, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She has been taking aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin, and has been prescribed lasix, midazolam, and fentanyl in the ICU.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is rising, and she has a history of septic shock. She may be at risk for further sepsis or organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and her oxygen saturation is still only 100% on 2L nasal cannula. She may require further respiratory support or mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has CAD, and her ejection fraction is only 20%. She may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is rising, and she has a history of leukocytosis. She may be at risk for further leukocytosis or complications related to leukocytosis, such as sepsis or organ dysfunction.
5. C. difficile colitis: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis, and she may require further treatment or management to prevent complications related to this infection.

In summary, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, cardiac complications, leukocytosis, and C. difficile colitis. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications and improve the patient's outcomes."

 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, with
   septic shock.
    # Sepsis/Hypotension:  Resolved.  Thought to be secondary to
   distributive shock, o2 requirement, in the setting of RLL pneumonia
   poorly compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - Completed 8 day course of vanco/cefepime/cipro empirically for HAP
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing:
   resolvied.  Likely [**1-22**] PNA, asthma, and ? fluid overload. CEs at that
   time negative. EKG unchanged from prior.
   -completed 8 days of broad spectrum vanc, cipro, cefepime for HA pna
   - completed 5 days of steroids for asthma
   -continue MDIs
   -lasix gtt with goal I/Os of -2L if BP tolerates
   -d/c non invasive ventilation as patient does not tolerate
   # leukocytosis: WBC 21.3, up from 13.1 two days prior. Patient having
   abdominal cramping, and stool output after broad spectrum abx.
   Afebrile.
   -continue po vanc empirically for C diff
   -send C diff
   -UA, Ucx, Blood cultures negative to date
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.  Patient had 20 beat run of VT
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, while aggressively diuresising, but resume
   ASAP
   - favor neo over levophed if needed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   - f/u cardiology recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female who presented with septic shock, acute respiratory failure, and coronary artery disease (CAD) after a recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). She was treated with invasive ventilation, antibiotics, and diuretics. Her white blood cell count has risen to 21.3, and she is experiencing abdominal cramping and stool output after broad-spectrum antibiotics. She is currently on vancomycin empirically for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) and has a history of pneumonia, asthma, and CAD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient's white blood cell count is rising, and she is experiencing abdominal cramping and stool output, which may indicate ongoing sepsis.
2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient is being treated empirically for C. diff, and her stool output may indicate a positive culture.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure, which may worsen if not properly managed.
4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and is at risk for further cardiac complications, including cardiogenic shock.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory response.
6. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, suggesting that the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is not contributing, but the patient's ejection fraction (EF) is only 20%, which may indicate cardiac tamponade.
7. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia, which may have contributed to her septic shock and respiratory failure.
8. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid status is concerning, with a positive fluid balance and signs of fluid overload, including hypertension and tachycardia.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia, which may contribute to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
10. Infection control: The patient is at risk for further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs)."

 ANXIETY
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, with
   septic shock, reintubated overnight.
    # Sepsis/Hypotension:  Resolved.  Thought to be secondary to
   distributive shock, o2 requirement, in the setting of RLL pneumonia
   poorly compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving, but now worsening again
   (cdiff vs steroids?)
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing:
   Decompensated overnight.  Likely [**1-22**] PNA, asthma, and ? fluid overload.
   CEs at that time negative. EKG unchanged from prior.
   -continue broad spectrum vanc, cipro, cefepime day 7 of 8 for HA pna;
   check vanco level in AM
   - day 5 of 5 of steroids for asthma
   -continue MDIs
   -lasix gtt with goal I/Os of -2L if BP tolerates
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.  Patient had 20 beat run of VT
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, while aggressively diuresising, but resume
   ASAP
   - favor neo over levophed if needed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   - f/u cardiology recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 ANXIETY
 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, with
   septic shock, reintubated overnight.
    # Sepsis/Hypotension:  Resolved.  Thought to be secondary to
   distributive shock, o2 requirement, in the setting of RLL pneumonia
   poorly compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving, but now worsening again
   (cdiff vs steroids?)
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing:
   Decompensated overnight.  Likely [**1-22**] PNA, asthma, and ? fluid overload.
   CEs at that time negative. EKG unchanged from prior.
   -continue broad spectrum vanc, cipro, cefepime day 7 of 8 for HA pna;
   check vanco level in AM
   - day 5 of 5 of steroids for asthma
   -continue MDIs
   -lasix gtt with goal I/Os of -2L if BP tolerates
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.  Patient had 20 beat run of VT
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, while aggressively diuresising, but resume
   ASAP
   - favor neo over levophed if needed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   - f/u cardiology recs
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as as above, resume amio (although long half-life means she
   will be therapeutic for a while)
   - supratherapeutic on coumadin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-inch tall male who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. He was previously intubated but was extubated 24 hours ago. He is currently receiving invasive ventilation support with a Bipap mask.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 137/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a sinus rhythm with a cardiac output of 2.4 liters per minute.

The patient's fluid balance is positive, with a total input of 1,455 mL and a total output of 3,090 mL, resulting in a net balance of -1,635 mL. His urine output is 3,090 mL, and his blood products have been transfused to maintain his hemoglobin level.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1, hemoglobin level of 26.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 421 K/uL. His blood cultures have been negative, and his urine culture has not been reported.

The patient's diagnosis includes respiratory failure, anxiety, septic shock, coronary artery disease, and ischemic heart disease. He is being treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and other medications to manage his condition.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to increased respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may progress, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's coronary artery disease and ischemic heart disease may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or myocardial infarction.
4. Renal failure: The patient's positive fluid balance and increased blood pressure may lead to renal failure or acute kidney injury.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's respiratory failure and septic shock may lead to neurological complications, such as altered mental status, seizures, or stroke.
6. Infection: The patient's positive fluid balance and increased blood pressure may lead to infection, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's respiratory failure and septic shock may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

 SHOCK, SEPTIC
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, with
   septic shock.
    # Sepsis/Hypotension:  Resolved.  Thought to be secondary to
   distributive shock, o2 requirement, in the setting of RLL pneumonia
   poorly compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving, but now worsening again
   (cdiff vs steroids?)
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing:
   Decompensated overnight.  Likely [**1-22**] PNA, asthma, and ? fluid overload.
   CEs at that time negative. EKG unchanged from prior.
   -continue broad spectrum vanc, cipro, cefepime day 7 of 8 for HA pna;
   check vanco level in AM
   - day 5 of 5 of steroids for asthma
   -continue MDIs
   -lasix gtt with goal I/Os of -2L if BP tolerates
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.  Patient had 20 beat run of VT
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, while aggressively diuresising, but resume
   ASAP
   - favor neo over levophed if needed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   - f/u cardiology recs
   # Afib:  Currently in sinus.
   - hold BB as as above, resume amio (although long half-life means she
   will be therapeutic for a while)
   - supratherapeutic on coumadin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   77 yo female s/p recent STEMI at OSH 10 days ago, s/p 3 stents & IABP x
   3 days for cardiogenic shock; had pneumonia treated with flagyl and
   levaquin, presented from rehab with increasing SOB and diarrhea, with
   septic shock.
    # Sepsis/Hypotension:  Resolved.  Thought to be secondary to
   distributive shock, o2 requirement, in the setting of RLL pneumonia
   poorly compensated in the setting of an acutely depressed EF s/p recent
   myocardial infarction.  Given CVP=12, stable EKG, and serial CE
   trending down, strongly favor sepsis over cardiogenic shock.
   - F/U cultures; no organisms seen on initial gram stain
   - vanco/cefepime/cipro; leukocytosis improving, but now worsening again
   (cdiff vs steroids?)
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure / increased work of breathing:
   Decompensated overnight.  Likely [**1-22**] PNA, asthma, and ? fluid overload.
   CEs at that time negative. EKG unchanged from prior.
   -continue broad spectrum vanc, cipro, cefepime day 7 of 8 for HA pna;
   check vanco level in AM
   - day 5 of 5 of steroids for asthma
   -continue MDIs
   -lasix gtt with goal I/Os of -2L if BP tolerates
   # CAD, s/p recent STEMI, now with EF 20%: Cardiac enzymes continually
   trending down suggesting that ACS is not contributing. EKG relatively
   stable, some rate dependent ST depressions inferiorly.  Previously
   under the impression that pt had been completely re-vascularized, but
   it seems that there are 80% lesions in mid and distal LAD along with
   90% circ lesion which have not been intervened upon as they were not
   felt to be cultprits in Acute MI.  Patient had 20 beat run of VT
   - Cont. ASA, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - Hold BB, ACEI, aldactone, while aggressively diuresising, but resume
   ASAP
   - favor neo over levophed if needed; goal HR as close to 60 as feasible
   - given degree of akinesis/infarct, pt should maintain therapeutic INR
   and be bridged with heparin for INR<2 to prevent LV thrombus
   - f/u cardiology recs

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female who presented with septic shock, respiratory failure, and acute coronary syndrome (STEMI) 10 days prior. She has undergone treatment for pneumonia, cardiogenic shock, and acute myocardial infarction. Currently, she is in the ICU with ongoing respiratory failure, septic shock, and cardiac issues.

The patient's WBC count is rising, and she has developed diarrhea, which may be related to Clostridium difficile (CDiff) or steroids. Her blood cultures are negative, and she is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her cardiac enzymes are trending down, suggesting that the acute coronary syndrome is not contributing to her current condition.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, and her ejection fraction (EF) is 20%. She has undergone stenting and has 80% lesions in the mid and distal left anterior descending (LAD) artery and 90% circumflex (Circ) lesion. She had a run of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and is currently in sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her ongoing septic shock, pneumonia, and cardiac issues.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may progress, leading to multi-organ failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac issues, including her reduced EF and history of coronary artery disease, may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
4. Clostridium difficile (CDiff) infection: The patient's diarrhea may be related to CDiff, which can lead to severe colitis and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload may worsen due to her ongoing septic shock and cardiac issues.
6. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's AKI may progress, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen due to her ongoing septic shock and cardiac issues.
8. Thromboembolic events: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and reduced EF may increase her risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia and septic shock.
2. Monitor the patient's WBC count and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary.
3. Consider adding antifungal therapy if the patient's septic shock persists.
4. Continue diuresis with furosemide to manage fluid overload.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and adjust therapy as necessary.
6. Consider adding anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic events.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as necessary.
8. Consider adding stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 30 mins<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male who has undergone a recent large NSTEMI, PCI to the LAD, and cardiogenic shock requiring IABP. He was previously intubated and is now re-extubated to nasal cannula with continued volume overload. The patient has a history of PNA, STEMI, and Afib.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Heart rate: 89 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 137/75 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 100%
* Weight: 72.1 kg (admission weight: 70 kg)

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, and his CXR has improved, especially in the lower fields, consistent with diuresis.

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Furosemide (Lasix) 3 mg/hour
* Midazolam (Versed)
* Fentanyl
* Lorazepam (Ativan)
* Aspirin, Plavix, statin, and ACEI
* Diuresis with Lasix gtt (goal I/O -2L+)
* Vanc PO until C Diff returns

The patient has been treated with antibiotics (Vanc, cefepime, and cipro) and steroids for PNA. His WBC count is increasing, but the etiology is unclear. He has also been treated for Afib and has an elevated INR of 4.7, which is being monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may worsen, requiring further respiratory support.
* Volume overload: The patient's continued volume overload may lead to worsening cardiac function and increased risk of cardiogenic shock.
* Infection: The patient's increasing WBC count and unclear etiology may indicate a developing infection, which needs to be further evaluated and treated.
* Bleeding risk: The patient's elevated INR and use of anticoagulants may increase his risk of bleeding.
* Deconditioning: The patient's prolonged ICU stay may lead to deconditioning, which can impact his overall health and recovery.
* C Difficile: The patient's C Difficile status is unclear, and further testing is needed to determine if he has an active infection.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiac, and infectious disease processes to prevent potential complications and promote his recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with a recent large NSTEMI, s/p PCI to LAD, and cardiogenic shock requiring IABP. The patient was re-extubated to nasal cannula with continued volume overload. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, and blood pressure of 137/75 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 100% and a respiratory rate of 17 inspirations per minute.

The patient has a history of asthma, and the note mentions that the patient completed a 5-day course of solumedrol today. The patient's INR is elevated at 4.7, and the note recommends holding coumadin.

The patient's laboratory results show a WBC count of 13.1, Hct of 26.2, and platelet count of 355. The patient's creatinine is elevated at 1.2 mg/dL, and the note recommends increasing vancomycin dosing in setting of improved acute renal failure.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continued diuresis to achieve an output of -2L+
* Reassessing the patient's condition in the morning
* Resending a urine analysis and urine culture
* Increasing vancomycin dosing
* Considering steroids as a possible source of the patient's increasing WBC count

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's history of low ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's continued volume overload and potential development of pneumonia
* Acute kidney injury due to the patient's elevated creatinine levels and potential development of acute tubular necrosis
* Infection due to the patient's history of pneumonia and potential development of secondary infections
* Bleeding due to the patient's elevated INR and potential development of gastrointestinal bleeding

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a recent large STEMI at OSH, followed by PCI to the LAD and cardiogenic shock requiring IABP. The patient presented with increasing shortness of breath, diarrhea, and was found to be hypotensive and hypoxemic. The patient is currently re-extubated to a nasal cannula with continued volume overload.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 137/75 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on 2L nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 21.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 421 K/uL. The patient's troponin-T level is 0.60 ng/mL, and his creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL.

The patient's medications include aspirin, plavix, statin, beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor. The patient is also receiving diuretics, including furosemide, and antacids.

The patient's assessment includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is being treated with diuresis and oxygen therapy. The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, and the etiology is unclear. The patient is being treated for pneumonia, and steroids are being considered as a possible source.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent STEMI and cardiogenic shock requiring IABP put him at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure and increasing white blood cell count put him at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Infection: The patient's increasing white blood cell count and unclear etiology put him at risk for infection, including sepsis and septic shock.
4. Deconditioning: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and lack of mobility put him at risk for deconditioning, which can lead to weakness, fatigue, and decreased functional status.
5. C. difficile infection: The patient's recent antibiotic use and lack of normal gut flora put him at risk for C. difficile infection.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She is doing well on a lasix infusion which will be titrated for
   clinical response as she transitions out of ICU later today. Cardiology
   staff to advise regarding long term management.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is chronically ill

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male who was admitted with respiratory failure and a recent large ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) at another hospital, followed by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery with cardiogenic shock requiring intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The patient also had pneumonia (PNA) and was found to be hypotensive and hypoxemic upon presentation.

The patient has been improving, with re-extubation to nasal cannula and improvement in volume overload. However, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula, but the ABG results show a pH of 7.34, which may indicate ongoing respiratory acidosis. Further monitoring and management of respiratory support may be necessary.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of STEMI and cardiogenic shock, and is currently on aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, and beta-blocker therapy. The patient's ejection fraction is 25%, which may indicate ongoing cardiac dysfunction.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of PNA and is currently being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, and the etiology of the increase is unclear. Further monitoring and management of the patient's infection may be necessary.
4. Deconditioning: The patient is chronically ill and has been in the ICU for several days. Deconditioning may be a concern, and the patient may require further rehabilitation and physical therapy.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated at 4.4, which may indicate ongoing bleeding risk. The patient's platelet count is also decreasing, which may indicate ongoing bleeding risk.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium level is slightly elevated at 4.7, which may indicate ongoing electrolyte imbalance. The patient's magnesium and phosphorus levels are also slightly elevated, which may indicate ongoing electrolyte imbalance.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but ongoing monitoring and management of these potential complications will be necessary to ensure the patient's continued improvement and safe transition out of the ICU."
