   Chief Complaint: back/jaw pain, nausea s/p cardiac cath with stent to
   LMCA
   24 Hour Events:
   Began coughing while in CCU and sat upright, was found to be bleeding
   from cath site and became nauseous and extremely agitated. Pressure
   held for 20 minutes. Given Zofran followed by Ativan 0.5 which did not
   calm pt. Pt continued to be restless, cough and bear down and cath site
   began bleeding again. Pressure held for 25 minutes, US negative for
   hematoma, Ativan 0.5 given. Pt began sundowning and Morphine 1mg IV was
   given. Increased bruising and induration developed along inguinal
   ligament and in suprapubic area. Hct dropped to 22.3 from 31.6 two days
   prior. 1UPRBC given and non contrast CT showed large pelvic hyperedense
   collection concerning for hematoma, measuring 10 x 7 cm. Fat stranding
   concerning for bleeding in the right thigh. Not able to comment on

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's 24-hour progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

**Summary:**

The patient is an 88-year-old female who underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting to the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery. She presented with back/jaw pain, nausea, and anginal equivalent symptoms. The patient experienced bleeding from the catheter site, nausea, and agitation, requiring pressure holding and medication administration. A non-contrast CT scan revealed a large pelvic hyperdense collection concerning for a hematoma, measuring 10 x 7 cm. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) dropped from 31.6 to 22.3, and 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) was given. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being monitored for ongoing blood loss and potential complications.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Hematoma:** The patient's pelvic hematoma is a significant concern, as it can lead to further bleeding, compression of surrounding structures, and potential organ damage.
2. **Anemia:** The patient's Hct has dropped significantly, and ongoing blood loss may exacerbate this condition. Close monitoring of Hct and blood product administration is essential.
3. **Kidney Injury:** The patient's creatinine level has increased to 2.0, and further monitoring is necessary to assess for potential acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease progression.
4. **Hypertension:** The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and careful monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications.
5. **Sundowning:** The patient's agitation and restlessness during sundowning may indicate a potential neurological or psychological complication that requires further evaluation and management.
6. **Infection:** The patient's induration and bruising along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic area may indicate a potential infection, which requires close monitoring and further evaluation.
7. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's cardiac catheterization and stenting procedure may have caused cardiac complications, such as pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade, which require close monitoring.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU to prevent and address these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 88-year-old female who underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and extension to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. She presented with back/jaw pain and nausea after the procedure.

The patient experienced several complications, including:

1. Bleeding from the catheter site, which was controlled with pressure and medication.
2. Development of a pelvic hematoma, which was confirmed by non-contrast CT scan.
3. Increased bruising and induration along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic area.
4. Decreased hemoglobin (Hct) from 31.6 to 22.3.
5. Rising creatinine (Cr) from 1.7 to 2.0, which is likely due to the dye load from the cardiac catheterization.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for the following conditions:

1. Hypertension: She is on Amlodipine 5 po qd and will increase Carvedilol to 12.5 po bid.
2. Chronic Kidney Injury: She is advised to hold nephrotoxins and will be monitored for ongoing blood loss and kept H/H above 8-24.
3. Anemia: She will follow up with pre-admission iron studies, B12, and folate levels, and will continue to monitor ongoing blood loss and keep H/H above 8-24.
4. Hematoma: She will undergo a coiling procedure for involved vessels and will be monitored for any further bleeding.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. White Blood Cell (WBC) count: 10.6 K/uL
2. Hemoglobin (Hct): 22.3
3. Platelet (Plt) count: 211 K/uL
4. Creatinine (Cr): 2.0 mg/dL
5. Troponin-T: 0.02 ng/mL
6. Glucose: 212 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

1. General appearance: No acute distress, anxious
2. Cardiovascular: Systolic ejection murmur heard best at LUSB, no radiation to carotids/clavicle
3. Peripheral Vascular: Bilateral radial and dorsalis pedis pulses present
4. Respiratory: Symmetric expansion, clear breath sounds
5. Neurologic: Responds to commands

The patient's medication regimen includes:

1. Aspirin 325 po qd
2. Plavix 75 po qd
3. Atorvastatin 80 po qd
4. Atenolol 5 po qd
5. Levothyroxine 88mcg po qd
6. Carvedilol 6.25 po bid
7. Hydralazine 10 IV x1
8. Morphine 1mg IV
9. Lorazepam (Ativan) 0.5mg IV
10. Haldol 1mg IV

The patient's plan includes:

1. Coiling procedure for involved vessels
2. Monitoring for ongoing bleeding and keeping H/H above 8-24
3. Follow-up with pre-admission iron studies, B12, and folate levels
4. Monitoring of kidney function and adjusting medication regimen as needed
5. Continued treatment for hypertension, chronic kidney injury, and anemia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a male who was admitted to the ICU following a cardiac catheterization procedure with stenting to the left main coronary artery (LMCA). The patient has been experiencing back and jaw pain, as well as nausea, since the procedure. Over the past 24 hours, the patient has developed bleeding from the catheter site, which was controlled with pressure for 20-25 minutes on two occasions. The patient has also become agitated, restless, and has developed increased bruising and induration along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic area. The patient's hematocrit has decreased from 31.6 to 22.3, and a non-contrast CT scan has revealed a large pelvic hyperdense collection concerning for hematoma, measuring 10 x 7 cm. The patient has also developed fat stranding in the right thigh, which is concerning for bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic Shock: The patient's bleeding from the catheter site and decreased hematocrit suggest the possibility of hemorrhagic shock. This requires close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, fluid status, and hemodynamic parameters.
2. Hematoma: The non-contrast CT scan has revealed a large pelvic hyperdense collection concerning for hematoma. This could lead to compression of surrounding structures, such as the ureters, bladder, or bowel, and may require surgical intervention.
3. Bleeding in the Right Thigh: The fat stranding in the right thigh is concerning for bleeding in this area. This could lead to compartment syndrome, which requires immediate attention to prevent long-term damage to the affected limb.
4. Infection: The patient's increased bruising and induration along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic area suggest the possibility of infection. This requires close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, or redness and swelling at the affected sites.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's use of nasal cannula oxygen and the presence of a large pelvic hematoma could lead to respiratory compromise. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiac catheterization procedure and stenting to the LMCA could lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiac tamponade. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac status is necessary to prevent these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Chief Complaint:** Back/jaw pain, nausea, and bleeding from the cath site after cardiac catheterization with stent placement to the left main coronary artery.

**24-Hour Events:** The patient began coughing while in the CCU, leading to bleeding from the cath site, nausea, and agitation. Pressure was applied for 20 minutes, and Zofran and Ativan were administered to calm the patient. The patient continued to be restless, cough, and bear down, leading to bleeding from the cath site again. An ultrasound was negative for hematoma, but a non-contrast CT scan showed a large pelvic hyperdense collection concerning for hematoma.

**Medical History:** The patient has a history of hypertension, chronic kidney injury, hypothyroidism, and Sjogren's syndrome.

**Current Medications:** Aspirin, Plavix, Atorvastatin, Atenolol, Amlodipine, Carvedilol, and Levothyroxine.

**Assessment and Plan:** The patient's bleeding from the cath site is a concern, and the plan is to contact the interventionalist to discuss a coiling procedure for the involved vessels. The patient's hematocrit has dropped from 31 to 22.3, and 2 units of packed red blood cells were given with less than adequate Hct correction.

**Potential Medical Complications:** 

1. Hematoma: The patient's pelvic fluid collection is concerning for a hematoma, which can lead to further bleeding, compression of surrounding structures, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped significantly, and ongoing bleeding may lead to further anemia, which can exacerbate existing medical conditions such as chronic kidney injury.
3. Chronic Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine has risen to 2.0, and nephrotoxins should be held to prevent further kidney damage.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid function should be monitored closely, and levothyroxine should be continued as prescribed.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and antihypertensive medications should be continued and adjusted as needed.
6. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is at risk for pulmonary embolism due to the presence of a pelvic fluid collection, and prophylactic anticoagulation should be considered.

**Recommendations:**

1. Monitor the patient's bleeding closely and consider further intervention if bleeding persists.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's hematocrit and adjust transfusions as needed.
3. Hold nephrotoxins and consider alternative medications for hypertension.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's thyroid function and adjust levothyroxine as needed.
5. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation to reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: back/jaw pain, nausea s/p cardiac cath with stent to
   LMCA
   24 Hour Events:
   Began coughing while in CCU and sat upright, was found to be bleeding
   from cath site and became nauseous and extremely agitated. Pressure
   held for 20 minutes. Given Zofran followed by Ativan 0.5 which did not

   began bleeding again. Pressure held for 25 minutes, US negative for
   hematoma, Ativan 0.5 given. Pt began sundowning and Morphine 1mg IV was
   given. Increased bruising and induration developed along inguinal
   ligament and in suprapubic area. Hct dropped to 22.3 from 31.6 two days
   prior. Haldol 1mg IV given. 1UPRBC given and non contrast CT showed
   large pelvic hyperedense collection concerning for hematoma, measuring
   10 x 7 cm. Fat stranding concerning for bleeding in the right thigh.
   Not able to comment on active extavazation. Hematoma compressing R
   ureter with R kidney hydronephrosis and possible rupture of renal
   pelvis. Hydralazine 10 IV given for BP.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the key events and findings as follows:

* The patient, an 88-year-old female, presented with back/jaw pain and nausea after cardiac catheterization with stent placement to the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery.
* While in the CCU, the patient began coughing and became restless, leading to bleeding from the catheter site and increased agitation. Pressure was held for 20-25 minutes, and the patient was given Zofran and Ativan, which did not calm her down.
* The patient developed increased bruising and induration along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic area, and her hemoglobin dropped from 31.6 to 22.3.
* A non-contrast CT scan showed a large pelvic hyperedense collection concerning for hematoma, measuring 10 x 7 cm, which is compressing the right ureter and causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture.
* The patient was given Hydralazine IV for hypertension, and her blood products were transfused.
* The patient has a history of sundowning, and her mental status deteriorated after being given benzodiazepines, leading to pulling out some IVs and the foley catheter. She is now being treated with Haldol or Seroquel/Trazodone as needed.
* The patient has hypertension, chronic kidney injury, hypothyroidism, and anemia, and is being managed accordingly.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Hematoma-related complications, such as bleeding, compression of vital structures, and potential rupture of the renal pelvis.
* Ureteral obstruction and hydronephrosis, which can lead to chronic kidney damage and potentially acute kidney injury.
* Chronic kidney injury, which can progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed properly.
* Hypothyroidism, which can cause a range of symptoms including fatigue, cold intolerance, and weight gain if not managed with adequate thyroid hormone replacement.
* Anemia, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath if not managed with adequate iron replacement and blood transfusions.
* Sundowning, which can cause agitation, confusion, and increased risk of falls and other injuries if not managed with appropriate sedation and behavioral interventions.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions to prevent complications and optimize her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: back/jaw pain, nausea s/p cardiac cath with stent to
   LMCA
   24 Hour Events:
   Began coughing while in CCU and sat upright, was found to be bleeding
   from cath site and became nauseous and extremely agitated. Pressure
   held for 20 minutes. Given Zofran followed by Ativan 0.5 which did not
   calm pt. Pt continued to be restless, cough and bear down and cath site

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient, an 88-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac catheterization procedure with stenting to the left main coronary artery. She presented with back/jaw pain and nausea. During her stay in the ICU, she developed several complications, including:

1. Bleeding from the catheter site, which was managed with pressure and medications.
2. Hematoma formation in the pelvis, measured 10x7cm, which is compressing the right ureter and causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture.
3. Anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 22.3g/dL, which is a significant drop from her baseline level of 31.6g/dL.
4. Delirium, which was managed with sedatives and restraints.
5. Hypertension, which was managed with medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71bpm, blood pressure of 182/78mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her respiratory support is minimal, with room air and an SpO2 of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 22.3g/dL
* Hematocrit: 25.4%
* Platelet count: 211 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.0mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.02ng/mL
* Glucose: 212mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, chronic kidney injury, hypothyroidism, and Sjogren's syndrome. She has a history of sundowning, which was managed with sedatives and restraints.

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued bleeding from the catheter site or hematoma formation.
2. Further compression of the right ureter and possible calyceal rupture.
3. Anemia, which may worsen if bleeding continues.
4. Delirium, which may require further management with sedatives and restraints.
5. Hypertension, which may require further management with medications.
6. Chronic kidney injury, which may worsen if nephrotoxins are not avoided.
7. Hypothyroidism, which may require further management with levothyroxine.
8. Sjogren's syndrome, which may require further management with immunosuppressive therapy.

In conclusion, the patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   TTE
   The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Transmitral Doppler and tissue
   velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
   dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CT abdomen/pelvis
   1. Large hyperdense structure in the right pelvis concerning for a
   large
   extraperitoneal hematoma, tracking along the medial thigh. Unable to
   comment
   on active extravasation due to lack of IV contrast administration.
   2. Compression of the right distal ureter due to large pevic hematoma,
   causing

   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 174**] [**Name (NI) **], MD
   on:[**2111-9-21**] 13:51 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, and Sjogren's syndrome. She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of left main disease and underwent a cardiac catheterization with a drug-eluting stent placement to the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery.

The patient has developed a large extraperitoneal hematoma in the right pelvis, which is compressing the right ureter and causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. The hematoma is also causing lower quadrant pain and tenderness on the right side.

The patient has a history of sundowning and has become anxious and restless, which may be contributing to the development of the hematoma. She has also been experiencing nausea and vomiting, which may be related to the hematoma or other underlying conditions.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 24.2% and a hematocrit level of 27.4%, indicating anemia. Her creatinine level is 2.0 mg/dL, which is elevated. Her potassium level is 5.7 mEq/L, which is elevated.

The patient is being treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin for her coronary artery disease. She is also receiving lasix for her congestive heart failure and is being monitored for her kidney function.

The patient's physical examination is significant for a large hematoma in the right pelvis, which is compressing the right ureter and causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. Her abdomen is soft and bowel sounds are present, but she has tenderness in the lower quadrants on the right side.

Based on the patient's condition, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient's large extraperitoneal hematoma may continue to bleed, leading to hemorrhagic shock.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hematoma may become infected, leading to sepsis.
3. Chronic kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate chronic kidney injury, which can progress to end-stage renal disease.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she continues to experience bleeding or has ongoing blood loss.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if she experiences stress or anxiety.
6. Coronary artery disease: The patient's coronary artery disease may worsen if she experiences ongoing bleeding or has underlying cardiac conditions.

The patient's plan of care includes ongoing monitoring of her hematoma and kidney function, as well as treatment with lasix for her congestive heart failure. She will also be followed up with a nephrologist to monitor her kidney function and receive guidance on managing her anemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   88yo F hx HTN, CKI, hypothyroidism, Sjogrens presented s/p cardiac cath
   with drug eluting stent to left main with extension to LAD.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Anginal equivalent is intrascapular back pain with
   nausea. Precath ECG showed ST elevations in V1-2 and AVR with
   depressions in 2,3,AVL. Left main disease seen on cath and stent placed
   to LMCA extending to LAD. Post-cath ECG essentially unchaged. Post-cath
   Tn 0.02 CK 88.  No anginal equivalent since admission to CCU.
   - Aspirin 325 po qd
   - Plavix 75 po qd
   - Atorvastatin 80 po qd
   .
   # HEMATOMA: Developed as pt began sundowning and became very
   anxious/restless at around 8pm. Ultrasound was negative for hematoma,
   but induration and brusing along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic
   area developed afterwards. CT abd/pelvis showed 10x7cm pelvic fluid
   collection. Hct dropped from 31 two days PTA to 23. 2UPRBC given
 will
   check post transfusion H/H. Hematoma also possibly compressing R ureter
   causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture.
   - Contact vascular re: coiling procedure for involved vessels or
   evacuation -> no intervention indicated
   - Consult urology re: possible calyceal rupture -> recommended
   conservative management at this point
   - Recheck H/H q6 to keep above [**8-24**] -> transfused one unit PRBC
   overnight, will transfuse another unit this AM
   .
   # DELIRIUM: History of sundowning on previous hospital admissions.
   Given benzos last night and mental status deteriorated.  Pulled out
   some IVs and foley catheter. Will continue treating underlying
   conditions. Would stay away from benzos and use Haldol or Seroquel /
   Trazodone qpm. Use restraints as needed.
   - no recurrence overnight
   .
   # HYPERTENSION: On Atenolol at home. Hydralazine 10 IV previously
   required, none overnight.
   - Amlodipine 5 po qd
   - Carvedilol 6.25 po bid
   .
   # PUMP: No previous caths or echos. No history or symptoms of previous
   HF. Pt appears euvolemic.  However, was given volume and has diastolic
   dysfunction
 will stop IV fluids and give lasix prior to next unit
   blood.
   - TTE -> see above, preserved LVEF > 55%
   - On Carvedilol 6.25 po bid
   - Will hold off on ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given rising creatinine as outpatient ->

   .
   # CHRONIC KIDNEY INJURY: Baseline Cr 1yr ago was 1.3. Pt was advised to
   stop Olmesartan this past week over concerns of increased Cr to 2.0 two
   days PTA. Cr 1.7 on admission and 2.0 today with bump likely due to dye
   load. FENa 3.3 so prerenal component is unlikely.  SCr cont to rise
   slowly.  Pt likely had significant CKD at baseline, given small body
   habitus
   - Hold nephrotoxins, given gentle IVF, monitor SCr
   .
   # ANEMIA: Baseline outpatient H/H [**10-31**], MCV 93.
   - follow up pre-admission iron studies, B12, folate
   - Will continue to monitor ongoing blood loss and keep H/H above [**8-24**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: left main disease
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2111-9-19**]: Urology consulted. Post transfusion Hct to 27.4.  Started
   maintenence IVF.  Urology and vascular services recommended
   conservative management.
   Serial Hcts -> 24.2 -> received one more unit PRBC, in addition to
   maintenance IVF
   kayexelate x 1 for K 5.7
   no events overnight, no delirium
   TTE
   The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Transmitral Doppler and tissue
   velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
   dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CT abdomen/pelvis
   1. Large hyperdense structure in the right pelvis concerning for a
   large
   extraperitoneal hematoma, tracking along the medial thigh. Unable to
   comment
   on active extravasation due to lack of IV contrast administration.
   2. Compression of the right distal ureter due to large pevic hematoma,
   causing
   right kidney hydroureteronephrosis, and calyceal rupture at the lower
   pole.
   Atrophic left kidney. Urology consult is recommended.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an 88-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of left main disease and was treated with a drug-eluting stent to the left main coronary artery. The patient has a history of hypertension, chronic kidney injury, hypothyroidism, and Sjogren's syndrome.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 65 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 130/50 mmHg. The patient is receiving maintenance IV fluids and has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells overnight.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 24.2%
* Hematocrit: 27.4%
* White blood cell count: 10.6 K/uL
* Platelet count: 211 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 38 mg/dL
* Potassium: 5.7 mEq/L
* Sodium: 134 mEq/L

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Well-nourished and no acute distress
* No signs of respiratory distress
* Soft and tender abdomen with no rebound or guarding
* Right groin with hematoma, tender, and unchanged in size
* No signs of peripheral edema

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Aspirin 325 mg orally once daily
* Plavix 75 mg orally once daily
* Atorvastatin 80 mg orally once daily
* Amlodipine 5 mg orally once daily
* Carvedilol 6.25 mg orally twice daily
* Levothyroxine 88 mcg orally once daily
* Kayexelate for increased potassium
* Conservative management for possible calyceal rupture
* Urology consult recommended

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued bleeding from the pelvic hematoma
* Compression of the right ureter causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture
* Development of acute kidney injury due to rising creatinine levels
* Hypothyroidism exacerbation
* Anemia exacerbation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-inch-tall individual with a chief complaint of left main disease, admitted to the ICU for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), acute renal failure (ARF), and retroperitoneal bleed (RP bleed) due to a procedure. The patient's condition has remained stable overnight, with no events reported. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 130/50 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal sinus rhythm, with no murmurs or rubs. The patient's abdomen is soft, with bowel sounds present, and no rebound or guarding. The patient's extremities show no edema, and the skin is warm with no rash.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.4 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 24.2%
* Platelet count: 211 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 10.6 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 38 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 2.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.02 ng/mL
* Glucose: 212 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to ARF, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias due to ACS, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and decreased perfusion to vital organs.
3. Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and invasive procedures, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
4. Respiratory complications due to ARF, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to respiratory failure.
5. Hemorrhagic complications due to RP bleed, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and decreased cardiac output.
6. Delirium and confusion due to ARF, which can lead to increased risk of falls and decreased quality of life.

Assessment and plan:

The patient is at risk for multiple complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications. The patient's plan should include continued cardiac monitoring, fluid management, and electrolyte replacement. The patient should also be monitored for signs of infection and respiratory compromise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   TTE
   The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Transmitral Doppler and tissue
   velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
   dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CT abdomen/pelvis
   1. Large hyperdense structure in the right pelvis concerning for a
   large
   extraperitoneal hematoma, tracking along the medial thigh. Unable to
   comment
   on active extravasation due to lack of IV contrast administration.
   2. Compression of the right distal ureter due to large pevic hematoma,
   causing
   right kidney hydroureteronephrosis, and calyceal rupture at the lower
   pole.
   Atrophic left kidney. Urology consult is recommended.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Hematoma expansion: The patient has a large pelvic hematoma, which can compress the right ureter, causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. Close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status and potential interventions such as coiling or evacuation of the hematoma may be necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Kidney injury: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.3, and it has risen to 2.0, indicating chronic kidney injury. The patient's small body habitus and history of hypertension and kidney disease may have contributed to this. Monitoring of the patient's creatinine levels and potential interventions such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics may be necessary to prevent further kidney damage.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have dropped from 31 to 23, indicating anemia. The patient's ongoing blood loss and potential iron deficiency may contribute to this. Monitoring of the patient's hemoglobin levels and potential interventions such as blood transfusions or iron supplements may be necessary to prevent further anemia.
4. Delirium: The patient has a history of sundowning and has experienced delirium in the past. The patient's mental status deteriorated after receiving benzodiazepines, and alternative treatments such as Haldol or Seroquel may be necessary to prevent further episodes of delirium.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and their thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels have been within normal limits. However, the patient's levothyroxine dosage may need to be adjusted based on their changing clinical status.
6. Chronic kidney injury: The patient's chronic kidney injury may be exacerbated by their small body habitus, hypertension, and kidney disease. Monitoring of the patient's creatinine levels and potential interventions such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics may be necessary to prevent further kidney damage.
7. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and their blood pressure has been controlled with medication. However, the patient's blood pressure may need to be closely monitored and adjusted based on their changing clinical status.

In terms of the patient's overall condition, they are currently stable, with a normal heart rate and blood pressure. Their oxygen saturation is 96%, and they are not experiencing any respiratory distress. However, their creatinine levels are rising, and they are at risk for further kidney damage. Close monitoring of the patient's clinical status and potential interventions such as ACE inhibitors or diuretics may be necessary to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   88yo F hx HTN, CKI, hypothyroidism, Sjogrens presented s/p cardiac cath
   with drug eluting stent to left main with extension to LAD.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Anginal equivalent is intrascapular back pain with
   nausea. Precath ECG showed ST elevations in V1-2 and AVR with
   depressions in 2,3,AVL. Left main disease seen on cath and stent placed
   to LMCA extending to LAD. Post-cath ECG essentially unchaged. Post-cath
   Tn 0.02 CK 88.  No anginal equivalent since admission to CCU.
   - Aspirin 325 po qd
   - Plavix 75 po qd
   - Atorvastatin 80 po qd
   .
   # HEMATOMA: Developed as pt began sundowning and became very
   anxious/restless at around 8pm. Ultrasound was negative for hematoma,
   but induration and brusing along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic
   area developed afterwards. CT abd/pelvis showed 10x7cm pelvic fluid
   collection. Hct dropped from 31 two days PTA to 23. 2UPRBC given
 will
   check post transfusion H/H. Hematoma also possibly compressing R ureter
   causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture.
   - Contact vascular re: coiling procedure for involved vessels or
   evacuation -> no intervention indicated
   - Consult urology re: possible calyceal rupture -> recommended
   conservative management at this point
   - Recheck H/H q6 to keep above [**8-24**] -> transfused one unit PRBC
   overnight
   .
   # DELIRIUM: History of sundowning on previous hospital admissions.
   Given benzos last night and mental status deteriorated.  Pulled out
   some IVs and foley catheter. Will continue treating underlying
   conditions. Would stay away from benzos and use Haldol or Seroquel /
   Trazodone qpm. Use restraints as needed.
   - no recurrence overnight
   .
   # HYPERTENSION: On Atenolol at home. Hydralazine 10 IV previously
   required, none overnight.
   - Amlodipine 5 po qd
   - Carvedilol 6.25 po bid
   .
   # PUMP: No previous caths or echos. No history or symptoms of previous
   HF. Pt appears euvolemic.
   - TTE -> see above, preserved LVEF > 55%
   - On Carvedilol 6.25 po bid
   - Will hold off on ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given rising creatinine as outpatient ->
   will start when renal function improves
   .
   # HYPOTHYROIDISM: TSH wnl two days PTA. Continue levothyroxine 88mcg po
   qd.
   .
   # CHRONIC KIDNEY INJURY: Baseline Cr 1yr ago was 1.3. Pt was advised to
   stop Olmesartan this past week over concerns of increased Cr to 2.0 two
   days PTA. Cr 1.7 on admission and 2.0 today with bump likely due to dye
   load. FENa 3.3 so prerenal component is unlikely.  SCr cont to rise
   slowly.  Pt likely had significant CKD at baseline, given small body
   habitus
   - Hold nephrotoxins, given gentle IVF, monitor SCr
   .
   # ANEMIA: Baseline outpatient H/H [**10-31**], MCV 93.
   - follow up pre-admission iron studies, B12, folate
   - Will continue to monitor ongoing blood loss and keep H/H above [**8-24**]
   -> post Tx Hct showed
   .
   FEN: heart healthy low sodium diet. Kayexelate for increased potassium
   given overnight

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   anxious/restless at around 8pm. Ultrasound was negative for hematoma,
   but induration and brusing along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney injury, hypothyroidism, and Sjogren's syndrome. She presented to the hospital with left main disease and was treated with a drug-eluting stent to the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery. She developed a large extraperitoneal hematoma in the right pelvis, which is compressing the right distal ureter and causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. She also has a history of sundowning and was treated with benzodiazepines, which caused her mental status to deteriorate. She was given one unit of packed red blood cells overnight and is being treated with conservative management.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hematoma expansion: The patient's hematoma is large and may continue to expand, causing further compression of the right distal ureter and worsening of her hydronephrosis.
2. Ureteral obstruction: The compression of the right distal ureter by the hematoma may lead to complete obstruction, causing further damage to the kidney and potentially leading to sepsis.
3. Kidney damage: The patient's kidney function is already impaired, and the compression of the right distal ureter may cause further damage to the kidney, potentially leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Sepsis: The patient's hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture may increase her risk of developing sepsis, which could be life-threatening.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's hematoma is large, and there is a risk of bleeding complications, such as further bleeding or bleeding into the peritoneal cavity.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's left main disease and history of hypertension increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or myocardial infarction.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic kidney injury and history of hypertension may increase her risk of developing respiratory complications, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pulmonary edema.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's history of sundowning and benzodiazepine use may increase her risk of developing neurological complications, such as delirium or seizures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   88yo F hx HTN, CKI, hypothyroidism, Sjogrens presented s/p cardiac cath
   with drug eluting stent to left main with extension to LAD.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Anginal equivalent is intrascapular back pain with
   nausea. Precath ECG showed ST elevations in V1-2 and AVR with
   depressions in 2,3,AVL. Left main disease seen on cath and stent placed
   to LMCA extending to LAD. Post-cath ECG essentially unchaged. Post-cath
   Tn 0.02 CK 88.
   - Aspirin 325 po qd
   - Plavix 75 po qd
   - Start Atorvastatin 80 po qd
   .
   # HEMATOMA: Developed as pt began sundowning and became very
   anxious/restless at around 8pm. Ultrasound was negative for hematoma,
   but induration and brusing along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic
   area developed afterwards. CT abd/pelvis showed 10x7cm pelvic fluid
   collection. Hct dropped from 31 two days PTA to 23. 2UPRBC given
 will
   check post transfusion H/H. Hematoma also possibly compressing R ureter
   causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture.
   - Contact vascular re: coiling procedure for involved vessels or
   evacuation
   - Consult urology re: possible calyceal rupture
   - Recheck H/H q6 to keep above [**8-24**]
   .
   # DELIRIUM: History of sundowning on previous hospital admissions.
   Given benzos last night and mental status deteriorated.  Pulled out
   some IVs and foley catheter. Will continue treating underlying
   conditions. Would stay away from benzos and use Haldol or Seroquel /
   Trazodone qpm. Use restraints as needed.
   .
   # HYPERTENSION: On Atenolol at home. Hydralazine 10 IV x1 last night.
   - On Amlodipine 5 po qd
   - On Carvedilol 6.25 po bid
   .
   # PUMP: No previous caths or echos. No history or symptoms of previous
   HF. Pt appears euvolemic.
   - Obtain TTE today
   - On Carvedilol 6.25 po bid
   - Will hold off on ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given rising creatinine as outpatient
   .
   # HYPOTHYROIDISM: TSH wnl two days PTA. Continue levothyroxine 88mcg po
   qd.
   .
   # CHRONIC KIDNEY INJURY: Baseline Cr 1yr ago was 1.3. Pt was advised to
   stop Olmesartan this past week over concerns of increased Cr to 2.0 two
   days PTA. Cr 1.7 on admission and 2.0 today with bump likely due to dye
   load. FENa 3.3 so prerenal component is unlikely.
   - Hold nephrotoxins
   .
   # ANEMIA: Baseline outpatient H/H [**10-31**], MCV 93.
   - follow up pre-admission iron studies, B12, folate
   - Will continue to monitor ongoing blood loss and keep H/H above [**8-24**]

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female who presented with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney injury, hypothyroidism, and Sjogren's syndrome. She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of left main disease and underwent a cardiac catheterization with a drug-eluting stent placed to the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending artery.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.3°C, heart rate 65 bpm, blood pressure 130/50 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is on maintenance IV fluids, and her central venous pressure is not reported.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,047 mL of fluids, with an output of 391 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,656 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is not receiving oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation.
* Physical examination: The patient appears well-nourished and has no acute distress. Her cardiovascular examination is normal, with no murmurs or rubs noted. Her abdominal examination is soft, with bowel sounds present, and her extremities are without edema.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

* Anemia: Her hemoglobin level is 24.2 g/dL, and she has received two units of packed red blood cells.
* Chronic kidney injury: Her creatinine level is 2.0 mg/dL, and she has a history of chronic kidney injury.
* Hypothyroidism: She is receiving levothyroxine 88 mcg per day.
* Hematoma: She has developed a pelvic fluid collection and possible calyceal rupture, which is causing hydronephrosis.
* Delirium: She has a history of sundowning and has been treated with benzodiazepines, which have caused her mental status to deteriorate.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Aspirin 325 mg per day
* Plavix 75 mg per day
* Atorvastatin 80 mg per day
* Contact vascular services for a coiling procedure or evacuation of the pelvic fluid collection
* Consult urology for possible calyceal rupture
* Recheck hemoglobin levels every 6 hours to keep above 8 g/dL
* Obtain a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) today
* Hold off on ACE inhibitors due to rising creatinine levels
* Continue levothyroxine 88 mcg per day
* Hold nephrotoxins
* Follow up pre-admission iron studies, B12, and folate
* Continue to monitor ongoing blood loss and keep hemoglobin levels above 8 g/dL

Overall, the patient is at risk for several complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, bleeding, and kidney injury. She requires close monitoring and management of her medical conditions to prevent these complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   88yo F hx HTN, CKI, hypothyroidism, Sjogrens presented s/p cardiac cath
   with drug eluting stent to left main with extension to LAD now with
   pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Anginal equivalent is intrascapular back pain with
   nausea. Precath ECG showed ST elevations in V1-2 and AVR with
   depressions in 2,3,AVL. Left main disease seen on cath and stent placed
   to LMCA extending to LAD. Post-cath ECG essentially unchaged. Post-cath
   Tn 0.02 CK 88.  No anginal equivalent since admission to CCU.
   - Aspirin 325 po qd
   - Plavix 75 po qd
   - Atorvastatin 80 po qd
   .
   # HEMATOMA: Developed as pt began sundowning and became very
   anxious/restless ~2hrs s/p cath. Ultrasound was negative for hematoma,
   but induration and brusing along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic
   area developed afterwards. CT abd/pelvis showed 10x7cm pelvic fluid
   collection. Hematoma also possibly compressing R ureter causing
   hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. Hct dropped from 31 two
   days PTA to 23.
   - Vascular on board
 no intervention indicated
   - Urology on board
 recommended conservative management at this point
   - Hct stable from last night
 will recheck H/H q12 to keep above [**8-24**]
 4UPRBC so far
   .
   # DELIRIUM: History of sundowning on previous hospital admissions.
   Given benzos last night and mental status deteriorated.  Pulled out
   some IVs and foley catheter. Will continue treating underlying
   conditions. Would stay away from benzos and use Haldol or Seroquel /
   Trazodone qpm. Use restraints as needed.
   - no recurrence overnight
   .
   # HYPERTENSION: On Atenolol at home. Hydralazine 10 IV previously
   required, none overnight.
   - Amlodipine 5 po qd
   - Carvedilol 6.25 po bid
   .
   # PUMP: No previous caths or echos. No history or symptoms of previous
   HF. Pt appears euvolemic. Echo showed mild diastolic dysfunction but
   EF>55%. Will hold off on fluid boluses
 got Lasix 80 prior to PRBC
   yesterday.
   - On Carvedilol 6.25 po bid
   - Will hold off on ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given rising creatinine as outpatient ->
   will start when renal function improves
   .
   # CHRONIC KIDNEY INJURY: Baseline Cr 1yr ago was 1.3. Pt was advised to
   stop Olmesartan this past week over concerns of increased Cr to 2.0 two
   days PTA. Cr 1.7 on admission. GFR likely significantly low at baseline
   given age and small body habitus. FENa 3.3 so prerenal component is
   unlikely. SCr continues to rise slowly post-cath likely [**2-2**] dye load.
   - Hold nephrotoxins
   - Scr stable for past 24hrs
 will continue to monitor
   - Can d/c Foley
   .
   # HYPOTHYROIDISM: TSH wnl two days PTA. Continue levothyroxine 88mcg po
   qd.
   .
   # ANEMIA: Baseline outpatient H/H [**10-31**], MCV 93. Anemia of chronic
   disease on iron studies.
   - Will continue to monitor ongoing blood loss and keep H/H above [**8-24**]

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female who underwent cardiac catheterization with a drug-eluting stent placement in the left main coronary artery with extension to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. She has a history of hypertension, chronic kidney injury, hypothyroidism, and Sjogren's syndrome.

The patient has developed several complications, including:

1. Pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture, which is causing hematuria and hydronephrosis.
2. Mild confusion and agitation, which led to her attempting to pull out her Foley catheter and IV lines.
3. Mild musculoskeletal back pain and lower abdominal pain.
4. Nausea and vomiting.
5. Anemia, which is being managed with blood transfusions and iron supplements.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. Elevated creatinine levels, which are likely due to the dye load from the cardiac catheterization and the underlying chronic kidney injury.
2. Elevated troponin levels, which suggest cardiac injury.
3. Mild diastolic dysfunction on echocardiogram, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

The patient's medication list includes:

1. Aspirin 325 mg orally once daily.
2. Plavix 75 mg orally once daily.
3. Atorvastatin 80 mg orally once daily.
4. Amlodipine 5 mg orally once daily.
5. Carvedilol 6.25 mg orally twice daily.
6. Levothyroxine 88 mcg orally once daily.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Conservative management of the pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture.
2. Aggressive fluid management to maintain euvolemia.
3. Monitoring of creatinine levels and adjustment of medication as needed.
4. Management of anemia with blood transfusions and iron supplements.
5. Treatment of nausea and vomiting with Zofran.
6. Consideration of adding Haldol or Seroquel/Trazodone for delirium management.
7. Continued monitoring of the patient's mental status and adjustment of medication as needed.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Further bleeding or hematoma expansion.
2. Renal failure or worsening of chronic kidney injury.
3. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Infection or sepsis.
5. Delirium or worsening of cognitive function.
6. Anemia or bleeding complications.
7. Hypothyroidism or worsening of hypothyroid symptoms.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting her plan of care as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old female who underwent cardiac catheterization with drug-eluting stent placement to the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. She developed pelvic hematuria and renal caliceal rupture, and was admitted to the ICU. She has been receiving various medications, including aspirin, Plavix, and atorvastatin. She has also developed a pelvic hematoma, which is being managed conservatively. The patient's mental status has been deteriorating, and she has been experiencing confusion, anxiety, and agitation. She has also developed mild back pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and her heart rate has been increasing. This could lead to hemodynamic instability and potential cardiac complications.
2. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine levels have been rising, and she has developed a pelvic hematoma, which could further compromise her renal function.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been decreasing, and she has developed anemia of chronic disease. This could lead to further complications, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased tolerance to medications.
4. Delirium: The patient's mental status has been deteriorating, and she has been experiencing confusion, anxiety, and agitation. This could lead to further complications, such as falls, injury, and increased risk of hospital-acquired infections.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status has been stable, but she has been experiencing mild back pain and nausea, which could be indicative of pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's peripheral vascular examination has revealed diminished pulses in both lower extremities, which could be indicative of DVT.
7. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has developed a pelvic hematoma, which could lead to UTI or other urinary tract complications.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has been experiencing mild back pain and nausea, which could be indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding or other gastrointestinal complications.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify and address any potential complications early on."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   88yo F hx HTN, CKI, hypothyroidism, Sjogrens presented s/p cardiac cath
   with drug eluting stent to left main with extension to LAD now with
   pelvic hematuria and renal caliceal rupture.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Anginal equivalent is intrascapular back pain with
   nausea. Precath ECG showed ST elevations in V1-2 and AVR with
   depressions in 2,3,AVL. Left main disease seen on cath and stent placed
   to LMCA extending to LAD. Post-cath ECG essentially unchaged. Post-cath
   Tn 0.02 CK 88.  No anginal equivalent since admission to CCU.
   - Aspirin 325 po qd
   - Plavix 75 po qd
   - Atorvastatin 80 po qd
   .
   # HEMATOMA: Developed as pt began sundowning and became very
   anxious/restless ~2hrs s/p cath. Ultrasound was negative for hematoma,
   but induration and brusing along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic
   area developed afterwards. CT abd/pelvis showed 10x7cm pelvic fluid
   collection. Hematoma also possibly compressing R ureter causing
   hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. Hct dropped from 31 two
   days PTA to 23.
   - Vascular on board
 no intervention indicated
   - Urology on board
 recommended conservative management at this point
   - Recheck H/H q6 to keep above [**8-24**]
 4UPRBC so far
   .
   # DELIRIUM: History of sundowning on previous hospital admissions.
   Given benzos last night and mental status deteriorated.  Pulled out
   some IVs and foley catheter. Will continue treating underlying
   conditions. Would stay away from benzos and use Haldol or Seroquel /
   Trazodone qpm. Use restraints as needed.
   - no recurrence overnight
   .
   # HYPERTENSION: On Atenolol at home. Hydralazine 10 IV previously
   required, none overnight.

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old female who underwent cardiac catheterization with a drug-eluting stent placement to the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. She presented with pelvic hematuria and renal caliceal rupture. She has a history of hypertension, chronic kidney injury, hypothyroidism, and Sjogren's syndrome. She was given ranitidine and furosemide, and her creatinine trend is increasing. She has developed a pelvic hematoma and fluid collection, which is compressing her right ureter and causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. She has also developed delirium and is being treated with conservative management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hematuria and renal caliceal rupture may lead to chronic kidney disease or even end-stage renal disease.
2. Pelvic hematoma and fluid collection may compress the right ureter, causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture, which can lead to chronic kidney disease or even end-stage renal disease.
3. Delirium may worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of falls, pressure ulcers, and other complications.
4. Rising creatinine levels may indicate acute kidney injury, which can be a sign of worsening chronic kidney disease or even end-stage renal disease.
5. Anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
6. Hypothyroidism may worsen if not properly managed, leading to decreased metabolic rate, fatigue, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
7. Chronic kidney injury may worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of cardiovascular events, anemia, and decreased quality of life.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's creatinine levels and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Continue to manage the patient's delirium with conservative measures and consider adding haloperidol or quetiapine if necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Continue to manage the patient's hypothyroidism with levothyroxine and monitor thyroid function tests.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's chronic kidney injury and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Consider referring the patient to a nephrologist for further management of her chronic kidney disease.
7. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist for further management of her cardiac condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour post-catheterization patient with acute renal failure, acute coronary syndrome, delirium, and retroperitoneal bleed. The patient has been receiving ranitidine and furosemide (Lasix) for fluid management. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, and blood pressure of 119/61 mmHg. Respiratory support is not required, and the patient is receiving oxygen therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.6, hemoglobin of 11.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 116 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level has increased from 2.0 to 3.1 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progression of acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, indicating worsening kidney function. This may lead to further fluid accumulation, electrolyte imbalances, and potential need for dialysis.
2. Coronary ischemia: The patient's acute coronary syndrome may lead to further cardiac complications, including myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen, leading to increased risk of falls, respiratory depression, and other complications.
4. Retroperitoneal bleed: The patient's retroperitoneal bleed may continue to bleed, leading to hypovolemic shock and potential need for surgical intervention.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid management is critical, and excessive fluid administration may lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and other complications.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte imbalances may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
7. Infection: The patient's catheterization and invasive procedures may increase the risk of infection, including sepsis and septic shock.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Adjust fluid management to prevent fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Consider further cardiac evaluation and treatment for the patient's acute coronary syndrome.
4. Continue to manage the patient's delirium and delirium-related complications.
5. Monitor the patient's retroperitoneal bleed and consider further imaging or surgical intervention as necessary.
6. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure and consider dialysis if necessary."

   88yo F hx HTN, CKI, hypothyroidism, Sjogrens presented s/p cardiac cath
   with drug eluting stent to left main with extension to LAD now with
   pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Anginal equivalent is intrascapular back pain with
   nausea. Precath ECG showed ST elevations in V1-2 and AVR with
   depressions in 2,3,AVL. Left main disease seen on cath and stent placed
   to LMCA extending to LAD. Post-cath ECG essentially unchaged. Post-cath
   Tn 0.02 CK 88.  No anginal equivalent since admission to CCU.
   - Aspirin 325 po qd
   - Plavix 75 po qd
   - Atorvastatin 80 po qd
   .
   # HEMATOMA: Developed as pt began sundowning and became very
   anxious/restless ~2hrs s/p cath. Ultrasound was negative for hematoma,
   but induration and brusing along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic
   area developed afterwards. CT abd/pelvis showed 10x7cm pelvic fluid
   collection. Hematoma also possibly compressing R ureter causing
   hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. Hct dropped from 31 two
   days PTA to 23.
   - Vascular on board
 no intervention indicated
   - Urology on board
 recommended conservative management at this point
   - Hct stable from last night
 will recheck H/H q12 to keep above [**8-24**]
 4UPRBC so far
   .
   # DELIRIUM: History of sundowning on previous hospital admissions.
   Given benzos last night and mental status deteriorated.  Pulled out
   some IVs and foley catheter. Will continue treating underlying
   conditions. Would stay away from benzos and use Haldol or Seroquel /
   Trazodone qpm. Use restraints as needed.
   - no recurrence overnight
   .
   # HYPERTENSION: On Atenolol at home. Hydralazine 10 IV previously
   required, none overnight.
   - Amlodipine 5 po qd
   - Carvedilol 6.25 po bid
   .
   # PUMP: No previous caths or echos. No history or symptoms of previous
   HF. Pt appears euvolemic. Echo showed mild diastolic dysfunction but
   EF>55%. Will hold off on fluid boluses
 got Lasix 80 prior to PRBC
   yesterday.
   - On Carvedilol 6.25 po bid
   - Will hold off on ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given rising creatinine as outpatient ->
   will start when renal function improves
   .
   # CHRONIC KIDNEY INJURY: Baseline Cr 1yr ago was 1.3. Pt was advised to
   stop Olmesartan this past week over concerns of increased Cr to 2.0 two
   days PTA. Cr 1.7 on admission. GFR likely significantly low at baseline
   given age and small body habitus. FENa 3.3 so prerenal component is
   unlikely. SCr continues to rise slowly post-cath likely [**2-2**] dye load.
   - Hold nephrotoxins
   - Scr stable for past 24hrs
 will continue to monitor
   - Can d/c Foley
   .
   # HYPOTHYROIDISM: TSH wnl two days PTA. Continue levothyroxine 88mcg po
   qd.
   .
   # ANEMIA: Baseline outpatient H/H [**10-31**], MCV 93. Anemia of chronic
   disease on iron studies.
   - Will continue to monitor ongoing blood loss and keep H/H above [**8-24**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old female who underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting of the left main coronary artery and extension to the left anterior descending artery. She developed a pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture, and was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring. Her condition has been stable overnight, with a stable hematocrit and no worsening of her hemodynamic status. She remains anemic, with a hematocrit of 24.2%. She has mild confusion and is anxious, but is able to follow simple commands. She has mild musculoskeletal back pain, lower abdominal pain, and nausea, but denies other symptoms. Her laboratory results show a rising creatinine level, but it has stabilized over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient's pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture pose a risk of hemorrhagic shock, particularly if the hematoma continues to expand or if there is bleeding into the retroperitoneal space.
2. Renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine level and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) increase her risk of developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
3. Infection: The patient's indwelling urinary catheter and Foley catheter increase her risk of developing urinary tract infections.
4. Delirium: The patient's mild confusion and anxiety pose a risk of delirium, particularly if her underlying conditions are not well-managed.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism and her current treatment with levothyroxine require close monitoring to ensure that her thyroid hormone levels remain within the normal range.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may require further evaluation and treatment to address underlying causes and improve her hemoglobin levels.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and her recent cardiac catheterization pose a risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or cardiac tamponade.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status, hematocrit, and creatinine level.
2. Administer blood products as necessary to maintain the patient's hematocrit above 24%.
3. Continue treatment of the patient's underlying conditions, including her hypertension, chronic kidney injury, and hypothyroidism.
4. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to further evaluate and manage the patient's kidney function.
5. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to further evaluate and manage the patient's cardiovascular status.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and provide supportive care as necessary to manage her delirium.
7. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to further evaluate and manage the patient's nausea and vomiting."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female who underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting of the left main coronary artery and extension to the left anterior descending artery. She developed a pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture, and is currently being treated for these complications.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

* Chronic kidney injury with rising creatinine levels
* Hypertension, managed with multiple medications
* Hypothyroidism, managed with levothyroxine
* Anemia of chronic disease
* Pelvic hematoma with compression of the right ureter and possible calyceal rupture
* Renal caliceal rupture
* Mild diastolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction >55%

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, and blood pressure of 119/61 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 96%, and she is not requiring supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a pelvic hematoma with bruising and induration over the inguinal ligament and suprapubic area, and mild lower abdominal pain and nausea. Her neurological examination is normal, with the patient able to follow simple commands and having a normal mental status.

Laboratory results include:

* Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL
* Hemoglobin: 22.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 88,000/mL
* Troponin-T: 0.02 ng/mL
* White blood cell count: 10.6 x 10^9/L
* Glucose: 212 mg/dL

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Conservative management of the pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture
* Continued treatment of her hypertension and hypothyroidism
* Monitoring of her anemia and kidney function
* Holding off on fluid boluses and ACE inhibitors due to rising creatinine levels
* Consideration of nephrotoxins and discontinuation of Olmesartan

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

* Further worsening of the pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture, leading to worsening kidney function or even acute kidney injury
* Development of acute heart failure due to the patient's mild diastolic dysfunction
* Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's low platelet count
* Worsening of the patient's anemia, potentially leading to further blood transfusions
* Development of electrolyte imbalances due to the patient's chronic kidney injury and hypertension."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female who underwent cardiac catheterization with a drug-eluting stent placement to the left main coronary artery extending to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. She presented with pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T: 36.9°C, HR: 66 bpm, BP: 108/61 mmHg, RR: 22 breaths/min, SpO2: 95%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: No significant changes noted
* Fluid balance: Total in: 330 mL, PO: 330 mL, TF: 0 mL, IVF: 0 mL, Total out: 1,250 mL, Urine: 1,250 mL, NG: 0 mL, Stool: 0 mL, Drains: 0 mL, Balance: -920 mL
* Respiratory support: No oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation
* Physical examination: Well-nourished, no acute distress, anxious; bilateral carotid bruits; 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at LUSB; peripheral edema absent; bruising along right inguinal ligament, inner thigh, and suprapubic area
* Labs: WBC: 10.6-10.7 K/μL, Hct: 32.8%, Plt: 35 K/μL, Cr: 2.9 mg/dL, TropT: 0.02 ng/mL, Glucose: 60 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: Given the patient's pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture, there is a risk of hemorrhagic shock if the bleeding is not controlled.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.3 mg/dL, and it has increased to 2.9 mg/dL since admission. This suggests a possible acute kidney injury, which may be exacerbated by the patient's underlying chronic kidney disease.
3. Delirium: The patient has a history of sundowning, and she has developed delirium since admission. This may be related to the patient's underlying medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism, or may be a result of medication side effects.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 31 g/dL two days post-admission to 32.8% currently. This may be related to ongoing blood loss or underlying anemia of chronic disease.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is 108/61 mmHg, which is slightly elevated. This may be related to her underlying hypertension or may be a result of the patient's cardiac condition.
6. Heart failure: The patient has a history of heart failure, and her ejection fraction is greater than 55%. There is a risk of heart failure exacerbation if the patient's cardiac condition is not managed appropriately.
7. Pulmonary embolism: Given the patient's pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture, there is a risk of pulmonary embolism if the patient's clotting cascade is not managed appropriately.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including hemorrhagic shock, acute kidney injury, delirium, anemia, hypertension, heart failure, and pulmonary embolism. Close monitoring and management of these conditions are essential to prevent further complications and ensure the patient's safety."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   88yo F hx HTN, CKI, hypothyroidism, Sjogrens presented s/p cardiac cath
   with drug eluting stent to left main with extension to LAD now with
   pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Anginal equivalent is intrascapular back pain with
   nausea. Precath ECG showed 1mm ST elevations in V1-2 and AVR with
   depressions in 2,3,AVL. Left main disease seen on cath and stent placed
   to LMCA extending to LAD. Post-cath ECG essentially unchaged. Post-cath
   Tn 0.02 CK 88.  No anginal equivalent since admission to CCU.
   - Aspirin 325 po qd
   - Plavix 75 po qd
   - Atorvastatin 80 po qd
   .
   # HEMATOMA: Developed as pt began sundowning and became very
   anxious/restless ~2hrs s/p cath. Ultrasound was negative for hematoma,
   but induration and brusing along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic
   area developed afterwards. CT abd/pelvis showed 10x7cm pelvic fluid
   collection. Hematoma also possibly compressing R ureter causing
   hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture. Hct dropped from 31 two
   days PTA to 23.  Pt received 4uPRBC and Hct has increased and
   stabilized.
   - Vascular on board
 no intervention indicated
   - Urology on board
 recommended MAG3 Renal scan to evaluate function
   of non-obstructed kidney
   - Hct stable

   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC KIDNEY INJURY: Baseline Cr 1yr ago was 1.3. Pt was
   advised to stop Olmesartan this past week over concerns of increased Cr
   to 2.0 two days PTA. Cr 1.7 on admission. FENa 3.3 so prerenal
   component is unlikely. Cr increased since admission likely [**2-2**]
   obstruction of right kidney & dye load. Cr currently trending down.
   - Hold nephrotoxins
   .
   # DELIRIUM: History of sundowning on previous hospital admissions.
   Given benzos on day of admission and mental status deteriorated.
   Pulled out some IVs and foley catheter. Will continue treating
   underlying conditions. Would stay away from benzos and use Haldol or
   Seroquel / Trazodone qpm. Use restraints as needed.
   - No recurrence overnight
   .
   # PUMP: No previous caths or echos. No history or symptoms of previous
   HF. Pt appears euvolemic. Echo showed mild diastolic dysfunction but
   EF>55%. Will hold off on fluid boluses and give Lasix prior to future
   PRBC.
   - On Carvedilol 6.25 po bid
   - Will hold off on ACE/[**Last Name (un) **] given rising creatinine as outpatient

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female who underwent cardiac catheterization with a drug-eluting stent placement in the left main coronary artery with extension to the left anterior descending artery. She developed a pelvic hematoma and renal calyceal rupture post-procedure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, and blood pressure of 108/61 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 95% on room air, and she is not experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath, or lightheadedness.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a pelvic hematoma with bruising and induration along the inguinal ligament and suprapubic area. She has a diminished radial pulse on the right side and a diminished pedal pulse on both sides. Her abdomen is soft and nontender, with mild tenderness to deep palpation in the right lower quadrant.

Laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL and a hematocrit of 32.8%. The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.7 mg/dL on admission to 2.9 mg/dL, and her potassium level is 4.0 mEq/L.

The patient's medications include aspirin, Plavix, and atorvastatin for her coronary artery disease, and carvedilol for heart failure. She is also taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism and amlodipine for hypertension.

The patient's plan includes continued monitoring of her hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, as well as her creatinine and potassium levels. She will receive 4 units of packed red blood cells to help increase her hemoglobin level. The patient will also undergo a MAG3 renal scan to evaluate the function of her non-obstructed kidney.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Hemorrhagic shock: The patient's pelvic hematoma and renal calyceal rupture may lead to significant blood loss, which could result in hemorrhagic shock.
2. Renal failure: The patient's increased creatinine level and decreased hematocrit may indicate kidney damage, which could lead to renal failure.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she experiences ongoing blood loss or has difficulty with blood transfusions.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if she experiences blood loss or has difficulty with blood transfusions.
5. Heart failure: The patient's heart failure may worsen if she experiences blood loss or has difficulty with blood transfusions.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's pelvic hematoma and renal calyceal rupture may increase her risk of developing a pulmonary embolism.
7. Infection: The patient's pelvic hematoma and renal calyceal rupture may increase her risk of developing an infection.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her hemodynamic status, electrolyte levels, and blood loss to prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour post-catheterization (s/p cath) patient in the ICU. The patient was called out to another ward but no bed was available, so the foley was discontinued, and PT and social work consults were ordered. The patient was out of bed in a chair.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 37.4°C (99.4°F), Tcurrent of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 66 bpm (60-73 bpm), blood pressure of 108/61 mmHg (71-148/74-85 mmHg), respiratory rate of 22 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with no acute distress, well-nourished, and anxious. The patient's cardiovascular examination reveals a normal S1 and S2, with no murmurs or rubs. The patient's peripheral vascular examination shows diminished radial and digital pulses on both sides.

Laboratory results show:

The patient's diagnosis includes renal failure, acute coronary syndrome, delirium/confusion, and retroperitoneal bleed (procedure-related).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening renal failure, potentially leading to dialysis dependence.
2. Cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or heart failure.
3. Delirium/confusion, potentially leading to falls, aspiration, or other complications.
4. Retroperitoneal bleed, potentially leading to hemorrhagic shock or other complications.
5. Infection, potentially leading to sepsis or other complications.

It is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to detect any changes or complications early and intervene promptly to prevent adverse outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old female who underwent cardiac catheterization with placement of a drug-eluting stent to the left main coronary artery with extension to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. She developed a pelvic hematoma and renal caliceal rupture. She has a history of hypertension, chronic kidney injury, hypothyroidism, and Sjogren's syndrome.

The patient has been experiencing no anginal equivalent symptoms since admission to the ICU. She has been receiving aspirin, Plavix, and atorvastatin as part of her cardiac medication regimen.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb): 32.8 g/dL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 33.5%
* Platelet count: 35 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 10.6 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 28 mEq/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 2.9 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.02
* Glucose: 60 mg/dL

The patient has also undergone imaging studies, including a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which showed a 10x7cm pelvic fluid collection and hydronephrosis.

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Right lower extremity edema: Absent
* Left lower extremity edema: Absent
* Bruising along the right inguinal ligament, inner thigh, and suprapubic area
* 1 focus of induration over the femoral artery

Potential medical complications:

1. Hematoma: The patient has developed a pelvic hematoma, which is a potential complication of cardiac catheterization. The hematoma may compress the right ureter, causing hydronephrosis and possible calyceal rupture.
2. Acute on chronic kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels have increased since admission, which may be related to the pelvic hematoma and dye load from the cardiac catheterization. The patient's kidney function may continue to deteriorate if the hematoma is not managed properly.
3. Delirium: The patient has a history of sundowning, which may be related to her underlying medical conditions. She may be at risk for further episodes of delirium if not managed properly.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic disease, which may be exacerbated by ongoing blood loss. Her hemoglobin and hematocrit levels will need to be closely monitored to prevent further anemia.
5. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may need to be managed aggressively to prevent further complications.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which may need to be managed with thyroid hormone replacement therapy.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of cardiac disease, which may be exacerbated by her current condition. She may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hematoma and kidney function.
2. Manage the patient's delirium with non-pharmacological interventions, such as reorientation and relaxation techniques.
3. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and consider transfusion if necessary.
4. Manage the patient's hypertension with medication and lifestyle modifications.
5. Continue thyroid hormone replacement therapy for hypothyroidism.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and consider further interventions if necessary.
7. Consider a MAG3 renal scan to evaluate the function of the non-obstructed kidney."
