 EKG - At [**2119-4-6**] 04:38 AM
   - started warming at 5pm
   - EEG: burst suppression, no seizure activity
   - UOP decreasing and hypotensive in setting of medications below
   - 1 am paralytics weaned and the patient started seizing with myclonic

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
     GCS 3. Spinal relexes 3+ now, mute plantar, without brainstem
   reflexes. However, appropriate respiratory drive given pH and CO2,
   suggesting brainstem respiratory circuitry largely intact. EEG still
   quite isoelectric with some beta with benzodiazepines. Return of burst
   suppression pattern when Versed and fentanyl were held this morning.
   Also some generalized myoclonic jerks. Altogether some recovery seen
   (spinal reflexes and only minimal ataxic breathing at presentation),
   but little and prognosis likely still bad. Neurology are following and
   will help prognosticate/manage. Family aware of these thoughts,
   broadly.
   - EEG overnight or 48 hours
   - Appreciate Neurology input with respect to EEG
   - Continue cooling for 12 - 24 hours, per protocol, then re-evaluate
   neurologic status as rewarmed, sedation and paralysis weaned.
   - Stop dilantin, per later recs from Neurlogy team.
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)
   .
   GERD
     Given some possible UGIB:
   - Hold omeprazole
   - Give IV pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   Inattentiveness
   - Hold methylphenidate 20 mg for now
   .
   BPH
   - Hold finasteride 5 mg for now
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
     GCS 3. Spinal relexes 3+ now, mute plantar, without brainstem
   reflexes. However, appropriate respiratory drive given pH and CO2,
   suggesting brainstem respiratory circuitry largely intact. EEG still
   quite isoelectric with some beta with benzodiazepines. Return of burst
   suppression pattern when Versed and fentanyl were held this morning.
   Also some generalized myoclonic jerks. Altogether some recovery seen
   (spinal reflexes and only minimal ataxic breathing at presentation),
   but little and prognosis likely still bad. Neurology are following and
   will help prognosticate/manage. Family aware of these thoughts,
   broadly.
   - EEG overnight or 48 hours
   - Appreciate Neurology input with respect to EEG
   - Continue cooling for 12 - 24 hours, per protocol, then re-evaluate
   neurologic status as rewarmed, sedation and paralysis weaned.
   - Stop dilantin, per later recs from Neurlogy team.
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)
   .
   GERD
     Given some possible UGIB:
   - Hold omeprazole
   - Give IV pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old man who was brought to the emergency department after a witnessed cardiac arrest at home. He was in cardiac arrest when EMS arrived and was rapidly cooled. He remains comatose with myoclonic jerks and has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3. His brainstem reflexes are absent, but his respiratory drive is intact. His electroencephalogram (EEG) shows burst suppression, and his blood work shows elevated liver enzymes and troponin levels.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes, and was taking medications for these conditions. He also takes anti-arrhythmic medications, including digoxin, diltiazem, and atenolol. His family history is significant for cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's current condition is concerning for severe hypoxic injury, and his prognosis is likely poor. His management includes cooling for 12-24 hours, sedation and paralysis weaning, and close monitoring of his neurological status. He will also require telemetry monitoring and potentially further cardiac workup.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis. Blood and urine cultures are pending.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and hypoxia may lead to respiratory failure if not adequately managed.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac arrhythmias and his current condition may lead to further arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and his current condition may lead to further bleeding.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest the possibility of infection. Close monitoring of his temperature and blood cultures is necessary.
6. Organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and troponin levels suggest the possibility of organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of his liver and kidney function is necessary.
7. Neurological deterioration: The patient's current neurological status is concerning, and further deterioration may occur. Close monitoring of his neurological status is necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue cooling for 12-24 hours and monitor the patient's neurological status closely.
2. Wean sedation and paralysis and monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
3. Continue telemetry monitoring and consider further cardiac workup.
4. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels closely and adjust his insulin infusion as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's liver and kidney function closely and adjust his medications as necessary.
6. Consider further gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis and monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely.
7. Monitor the patient's temperature and blood cultures closely and consider further antibiotic therapy if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-inch tall individual with a weight not specified, admitted to the ICU with a likely VF arrest of unknown cause. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* The patient is sedated and encephalopathic, unresponsive to stimuli.
* The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a heart rate of 73 bpm and a blood pressure of 81/42 mmHg.
* The patient is receiving multiple medications, including propofol, fosphenytoin, and midazolam for seizure control.
* The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 80% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
* The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose, and abnormal liver function tests.
* The patient's imaging studies show periventricular hypodensity on CT head, possibly chronic, but cannot exclude hypoperfusion injury.
* The patient's microbiology results are pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal liver function tests.
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to the patient's diabetes mellitus and insulin infusion.
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to the patient's atrial fibrillation and VF arrest.
* Respiratory failure or respiratory distress due to the patient's mechanical ventilation and hypoxia.
* Neurological complications such as cerebral edema or brain herniation due to the patient's head injury and elevated intracranial pressure.
* Infections such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections due to the patient's mechanical ventilation and indwelling catheters.
* Thrombocytopenia or bleeding due to the patient's elevated blood glucose and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's current condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications."

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report.
   - Further history from daughter, who was present when he collapsed
   - CTA (done and wet read negative) - f/u final read
   - F/u Urine and serum toxicology
   - Telemetry
   - Initiate therapeutic hypothermia with goal temp 34.5 C. HOB > 30
   degrees, goal pCO2 35-40. Page with questions - [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1580**] [**Numeric Identifier 5172**]
   - Add to VF arrest hypothermia study and randomize to receive
   hydrocortisone 100 q8h IV for 7 days post-arrest.
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID
   - Defer digoxin until a.m.
   - Diltiazem 30 mg PO q6h
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Warfarin 5 mg PO QD
   .
   Coma
     Likely hypoxic injury given non-responsiveness and myoclonus.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report.
   - Further history from daughter, who was present when he collapsed
   - CTA (done and wet read negative) - f/u final read
   - F/u Urine and serum toxicology
   - Telemetry

   degrees, goal pCO2 35-40. Page with questions - [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1580**] [**Numeric Identifier 5172**]
   - Add to VF arrest hypothermia study and randomize to receive
   hydrocortisone 100 q8h IV for 7 days post-arrest.
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID
   - Defer digoxin until a.m.
   - Diltiazem 30 mg PO q6h
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Warfarin 5 mg PO QD
   .
   Coma
     Likely hypoxic injury given non-responsiveness and myoclonus.
   Difficult to determine outcome at present, particularly given sedation,
   cooling, paralysis, other medications. Nonetheless, neurologic
   examination shows no reflex activity whatever. Myoclonus can sometimes
   represent post-hypoxic myoclonic epilepsy. EEG at present shows
   near-isoelectric potentials interupted by bursts of slow activity with

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old man who was brought to the ICU after a witnessed cardiac arrest at home. He was found to be in ventricular fibrillation (VF) and was rapidly cooled. He remains unresponsive and has been diagnosed with severe hypoxic injury. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, and is taking multiple medications, including anti-arrhythmics. He has also been diagnosed with pneumonia and has a fever.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular Fibrillation (VF): The patient's VF arrest may be due to a variety of factors, including coronary artery disease, electrolyte imbalances, or medication toxicity. The patient's VF may persist or recur, requiring continued treatment with anti-arrhythmics and cardioversion.
2. Hypoxic Brain Injury: The patient's prolonged hypoxia may have caused irreversible brain damage, leading to long-term cognitive and functional impairment.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
4. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia may lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ failure and death.
5. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest may recur, requiring continued treatment with anti-arrhythmics and cardioversion.
6. Renal Failure: The patient's hypotension and hypoxia may cause acute kidney injury, leading to renal failure.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's pneumonia and hypoxia may cause respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's hypoxic brain injury may cause neurological complications, such as seizures, coma, or brain death.
9. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Infection: The patient's indwelling catheters and central lines may increase the risk of infection.

Treatment Plan:

1. Continue therapeutic hypothermia to a target temperature of 33°C.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and treat any arrhythmias that occur.
3. Continue anti-arrhythmics and cardioversion as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's neurological status and treat any neurological complications that occur.
5. Continue mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and treat any acute kidney injury that occurs.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and treat any respiratory failure that occurs.
8. Continue anticoagulation therapy and monitor the patient's coagulation status.

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
     GCS 3. Spinal relexes 3+ now, mute plantar, without brainstem
   reflexes. However, appropriate respiratory drive given pH and CO2,
   suggesting brainstem respiratory circuitry largely intact. EEG still
   quite isoelectric with some beta with benzodiazepines. Return of burst
   suppression pattern when Versed and fentanyl were held this morning.
   Also some generalized myoclonic jerks. Altogether some recovery seen
   (spinal reflexes and only minimal ataxic breathing at presentation),
   but little and prognosis likely still bad. Neurology are following and
   will help prognosticate/manage. Family aware of these thoughts,
   broadly.
   - EEG overnight or 48 hours
   - Appreciate Neurology input with respect to EEG
   - Continue cooling for 12 - 24 hours, per protocol, then re-evaluate
   neurologic status as rewarmed, sedation and paralysis weaned.
   - Stop dilantin, per later recs from Neurlogy team.
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)
   .
   GERD
     Given some possible UGIB:
   - Hold omeprazole
   - Give IV pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   Inattentiveness
   - Hold methylphenidate 20 mg for now
   .
   BPH
   - Hold finasteride 5 mg for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
     GCS 3. Spinal relexes 3+ now, mute plantar, without brainstem
   reflexes. However, appropriate respiratory drive given pH and CO2,
   suggesting brainstem respiratory circuitry largely intact. EEG still
   quite isoelectric with some beta with benzodiazepines. Return of burst
   suppression pattern when Versed and fentanyl were held this morning.
   Also some generalized myoclonic jerks. Altogether some recovery seen
   (spinal reflexes and only minimal ataxic breathing at presentation),
   but little and prognosis likely still bad. Neurology are following and
   will help prognosticate/manage. Family aware of these thoughts,
   broadly.
   - EEG overnight or 48 hours
   - Appreciate Neurology input with respect to EEG
   - Continue cooling for 12 - 24 hours, per protocol, then re-evaluate
   neurologic status as rewarmed, sedation and paralysis weaned.
   - Stop dilantin, per later recs from Neurlogy team.
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)
   .
   GERD
     Given some possible UGIB:
   - Hold omeprazole

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 10742**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3876**], MD

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old man who was brought to the ICU after a witnessed cardiac arrest at home. He was in atrial fibrillation and had a pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF) arrest. He was rapidly cooled, but his neurological status remains poor, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3 and myoclonus every 10-20 seconds. His laboratory results show elevated troponin and CK-MB levels, suggesting possible cardiac ischemia or infarction. His imaging studies, including a CT head, show periventricular hypodensity, possibly chronic, but cannot exclude hypoperfusion injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is likely related to VF, but the exact cause is unclear. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Cardiac ischemia or infarction: The patient's elevated troponin and CK-MB levels suggest possible cardiac ischemia or infarction, which may have contributed to his cardiac arrest.
3. Hypoxic brain injury: The patient's poor neurological status and myoclonus may be related to hypoxic brain injury, which can occur due to prolonged cardiac arrest or hypoperfusion.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and possible infection (as evidenced by the presence of bacteria in his blood and urine cultures) may indicate sepsis.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's low suspicion of gastrointestinal bleeding is based on his lack of bleeding and stable hematocrit.
6. Diabetes: The patient's hyperglycemia on arrival may indicate undiagnosed diabetes, which can increase his risk of complications.
7. Liver enzyme abnormalities: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver damage or dysfunction, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including shock, medication, or underlying liver disease.
8. Acidosis: The patient's respiratory acidosis and lactic acidosis may be related to his hypoxia and hypoperfusion.
9. Gastrointestinal motility disorders: The patient's gastroparesis may be related to his hypoperfusion and hypoxia.
10. Infections: The patient's presence of bacteria in his blood and urine cultures may indicate underlying infections, which can contribute to his poor prognosis.

Plan:

1. Continue cooling for 12-24 hours, per protocol, then re-evaluate neurological status as rewarmed.
2. Wean sedation and paralysis as tolerated.
3. Monitor for signs of cardiac ischemia or infarction, such as changes in cardiac rhythm or signs of heart failure.
4. Continue antibiotics for possible infection.
5. Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or other gastrointestinal complications.
6. Manage diabetes with insulin infusion and convert to sliding scale as tolerated.
7. Monitor liver enzyme abnormalities and adjust medication as needed.
8. Monitor acidosis and adjust ventilation as needed.
9. Consider gastrointestinal motility disorders and manage accordingly.
10. Monitor for signs of infections and adjust antibiotic therapy as needed."

   24 Hour Events:
   - 5:30P developed bigemeny for 15 mins, lytes okay, resolved
   spontaneously
   - dilantin stopped
   - ET tube changed from 6 to 8 (received paralytic for this)
   - ET tube advanced, still seems 6.6cm above, need to f/u final read
   - CXR demonstrates right lower lobe and partial right middle lobe
   collapse
   - increasing FiO2 and PEEP requirements over course of day; adjusted
   vent settings without significant improvement. Added fentanyl to
   increase sedation, not effective. Re-paralysed.
   - He was desynchronous with the ventilator, so re-paralysed.
   Unfortunately, Neurology came by when ETT was being changed, and
   paralytics had been started more by protocol than by necessity, it
   would seem. Neurology ask that we hold paralysis and then sedation
   before they come in the morning, so that they can evaluate more
   usefully.
   - discussed with IP; suggest no major changes, consider pulm consult
   tomorrow
   - pt spiked fever to 104, started to develop brown sputum purulent
   appaering, despite lack of infiltrate we started emperic
   vanc/zosyn/levo given profound hypoxia
   - now sputum growing GNRs 4+ in a good sample, good thing we started

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   spontaneously
   - dilantin stopped
   - ET tube changed from 6 to 8 (received paralytic for this)
   - ET tube advanced, still seems 6.6cm above, need to f/u final read
   - CXR demonstrates right lower lobe and partial right middle lobe
   collapse
   - increasing FiO2 and PEEP requirements over course of day; adjusted
   vent settings without significant improvement. Added fentanyl to
   increase sedation, not effective. Re-paralysed.
   - He was desynchronous with the ventilator, so re-paralysed.
   Unfortunately, Neurology came by when ETT was being changed, and
   paralytics had been started more by protocol than by necessity, it
   would seem. Neurology ask that we hold paralysis and then sedation
   before they come in the morning, so that they can evaluate more
   usefully.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 70-inch tall individual who was admitted with a chief complaint of VF arrest. Over the past 24 hours, the patient has experienced several significant events.

The patient's respiratory status has deteriorated, with increasing FiO2 and PEEP requirements. Despite adjusting ventilator settings, there has been no significant improvement. The patient has developed brown, purulent sputum, and a CXR demonstrates right lower lobe and partial right middle lobe collapse. Empiric antibiotics were started, and the patient's sputum grew GNRs 4+ in a good sample.

The patient's neurological status is concerning, with desynchronization with the ventilator and the need for repeated paralysis. Neurology has requested that paralysis and sedation be held until morning to allow for a more useful evaluation.

The patient's cardiovascular status is also concerning, with a history of cardiac arrest and ongoing hypoxia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 16.5
* Hct: 35.0
* Plt: 238
* Cr: 2.0
* TropT: 0.09
* TCO2: 22
* Glucose: 135
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 39.6/38.9/4.1, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 561/8/0.09, ALT / AST: 29/89, Alk Phos / T Bili: 60/0.4, Differential-Neuts: 79.9 %, Lymph: 16.7 %, Mono: 2.3 %, Eos: 0.4 %, Lactic Acid: 1.2 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.3 g/dL, LDH: 344 IU/L, Ca++: 7.8 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 4.4 mg/dL

The patient's fluid analysis and other labs are normal.

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CXR demonstrates right lower lobe and partial right middle lobe collapse
* No new CXR since yesterday

The patient's microbiology results show:

* GNRs in sputum - covered

The patient's ECG shows no new findings today.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS)
* SEIZURE, WITH STATUS EPILEPTICUS
* DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE I
* CARDIAC ARREST

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure and further deterioration in oxygenation
* Sepsis and septic shock due to GNRs in sputum
* Cardiac arrhythmias and further cardiac arrest
* Neurological deterioration and potential permanent brain damage
* Diabetes ketoacidosis and hyperglycemia
* Hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia
* Renal failure and acute kidney injury

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent further deterioration."

   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
     GCS 3. Spinal relexes 3+ now, mute plantar, without brainstem
   reflexes. However, appropriate respiratory drive given pH and CO2,
   suggesting brainstem respiratory circuitry largely intact. EEG still
   quite isoelectric with some beta with benzodiazepines. Return of burst
   suppression pattern when Versed and fentanyl were held this morning.
   Also some generalized myoclonic jerks. Altogether some recovery seen
   (spinal reflexes and only minimal ataxic breathing at presentation),
   but little and prognosis likely still bad. Neurology are following and
   will help prognosticate/manage. Family aware of these thoughts,
   broadly.
   - EEG overnight or 48 hours
   - Appreciate Neurology input with respect to EEG
   - Continue cooling for 12 - 24 hours, per protocol, then re-evaluate
   neurologic status as rewarmed, sedation and paralysis weaned.
   - Stop dilantin, per later recs from Neurlogy team.
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2

   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: VF arrest.
   24 Hour Events:
   - 5:30P developed bigemeny for 15 mins, lytes okay, resolved
   spontaneously
   - dilantin stopped
   - ET tube changed from 6 to 8 (received paralytic for this)
   - ET tube advanced, still seems 6.6cm above, need to f/u final read
   - CXR demonstrates right lower lobe and partial right middle lobe
   collapse
   - increasing FiO2 and PEEP requirements over course of day; adjusted
   vent settings without significant improvement. Added fentanyl to
   increase sedation, not effective. Re-paralysed.
   - He was desynchronous with the ventilator, so re-paralysed.
   Unfortunately, Neurology came by when ETT was being changed, and
   paralytics had been started more by protocol than by necessity, it
   would seem. Neurology ask that we hold paralysis and then sedation
   before they come in the morning, so that they can evaluate more
   usefully.
   - discussed with IP; suggest no major changes, consider pulm consult
   tomorrow
   - pt spiked fever to 104, started to develop brown sputum purulent
   appaering, despite lack of infiltrate we started emperic
   vanc/zosyn/levo given profound hypoxia
   - now sputum growing GNRs 4+ in a good sample, good thing we started

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
      Neurology have been very helpful in understanding deficits and
   prognosis. He has at least some preserved medullary function, as
   evidenced by breathing well on pressure support. He had a sluggish
   response to caloric stimulation, but is otherwise without other
   evidence of pontine/midbrain function. No evidence of cortical
   function. Per Neurology, good outcome can not be expected
 please see
   their note.
   - Discuss with family
   - Appreciate Neurology input as above
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)
   .
   GERD
     Given some possible UGIB:
   - Hold omeprazole
   - Give IV pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   Inattentiveness
   - Hold methylphenidate 20 mg for now
   .
   BPH
   - Hold finasteride 5 mg for now
   .

   ASSESSMENT
   .
   This 70-year-old man has had a witnessed cardiac arrest at home with
   CRP by his daughter at the scene. VF was noted in EMS. He was rapidly
   cooled, but his neurologic unresponsiveness and myoclonus is concerning
   for severe hypoxic injury. The etiology of this presentation is
   unclear.
   .
   PLAN
   .
   Coma
      Neurology have been very helpful in understanding deficits and
   prognosis. He has at least some preserved medullary function, as
   evidenced by breathing well on pressure support. He had a sluggish
   response to caloric stimulation, but is otherwise without other
   evidence of pontine/midbrain function. No evidence of cortical
   function. Per Neurology, good outcome can not be expected
 please see
   their note.
   - Discuss with family
   - Appreciate Neurology input as above
   .
   Cardiorespiratory (VF?) Arrest
     Differential diagnosis includes arhythmia, pulmonary embolism,
   myocardial ischemia, perhaps resulting in arhythmia, toxic. CTA was
   negative on wet read, ischemia appears not to be profound, given
   enzymes and EKG, toxicity is possible. Arhythmia is possible,
   particularly if digoxin was being taken incorrectly, if too much
   methylphenidate was being taken (he was recorded as taking 20 mg).
   Given low level of digoxin (0.7) and history of non-compliance with
   glipizide dosing (per PCP), medication non-compliance or error is also
   possible. He takes three anti-arhythmic medications (atenolol,
   diltiazem and digoxin). Was likely VF arrest based on EMS report. Given
   that he struck his head, likely arrhythmia (sudden LOC).
   - Telemetry
   - Was on diltiazem 300 mg/d and atenolol 100 mg/d, so may need to add
   some block back
   - metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   .
   Arhythmia, Ventricular ectopy
     Substantial ventricular ectopy, short runs of VT. Patient takes
   diltiazem, atenolol, digoxin at home. Given frequent ectopy will add
   back small doses, given cooling.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q4h
   - Hold digoxin, diltiazem
   - Telemetry
   - EKG in a.m.
   - Hold warfarin - supratherapeutic
   .
   Gastroparesis
     In context of arrest, possible hypoperfusion, then paralysis
   - Try pro-cholinergics if desire to give PO meds or tube feeds
 hold
   off for now
   .
   Fluid status
     No Pos given above and now quite negative by Is&Os.
   - Maintenance 1/2NSD5W at 125 cc/hr for 1 L then reevaluate
   .
   Hypotension (and hypertension)
     Improved with some fluid and brief phenylephrine. Was transient after
   catheterization, sedation, cooling. Now improved, but only relative
   given that we are hold antihypertensive meds.
   - Fluids and pressors to support pressure (phenylephrine)
   - Hold antihypertensives (enalapril, atenolol, diltiazem)
   .
   Coronary Artery Disease
     Active disease that is not thought to be sufficiently flow-limiting
   to produce symptomatic disease. Troponin/enzyme leak not surprising
   given DC cardioversion x 2 or 3 (unclear) and chest compressions, along
   with hypotension, hypoxia.
   - Telemetry
   - Continue rosuvastatin 20 mg
   - ASA 325 mg
   .
   Question of Gastrointestinal Bleeding
     Low suspicion now. Will not impact management at present. Some likely
   clot as cast within OG tube and then removed retaining shape. No other
   blood or concerning output. Could not suction stomach - think may be
   against wall. Low suspicion at present and Hct stable.
   - Continue ASA 325 given CAD
   - Follow hematocrit
   .
   Diabetes
     Insulin IV for now, given hyperglycemia on arrival.
   - Convert to sliding scale
   - Hold metformin and glipizide while inpatient
   .
   Critical Care and Ventilator
   CMV on Arctic Sun. Now PSV and hypoxia despite good pH and CO2,
   suggestive of exchange limit
 likely secretions.
   - Intubation - change endotracheal tube for larger size in a.m. if any
   difficulties suctioning (only a 6)
   - Continue PSV, increase PEEP and try to wean FiO2
   .
   Head Injury
     Head CT clears for bleed and facture. Neck CT/spine CT not performed.
   - Keep in [**Location (un) 408**] J collar for now
   .
   Liver Enzyme Abnormalities
     Likely early shock liver, but may be medication induced or other.
   Will rise rapidly if shock liver.
   - Follow in a.m.
   .
   Acidosis
     Lactic acidosis, along with respiratory acidosis. Has gap that is
   closing and tracking lactate. Will check blood and urine cultures also,
   but likely secondary to hypoxia. Trending down.
   - Follow blood gas
   .
   Depression
   - Hold fluoxetine (t1/2 4 - 6 days)
   .
   GERD
     Given some possible UGIB:
   - Hold omeprazole
   - Give IV pantoprazole 40 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   Inattentiveness
   - Hold methylphenidate 20 mg for now
   .
   BPH
   - Hold finasteride 5 mg for now
   .

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old man who suffered a witnessed cardiac arrest at home and was resuscitated by emergency medical services (EMS). He was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes, and takes multiple medications, including anti-arrhythmics.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with increasing FiO2 and PEEP requirements, and a recent spike in fever to 104°F. He has developed brown sputum and purulent appearing, despite lack of infiltrate, and was started on empirical antibiotics. The patient's sputum grew GNRs 4+ in a good sample, which is a good thing he was started on antibiotics.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin and creatine kinase levels, indicating possible cardiac injury. His liver enzymes are elevated, and he has a lactic acidosis. He is also hypotensive and has a history of hypertension.

The patient's neurological status is concerning, with myoclonus every 10-20 seconds involving limbs, primarily, and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3. He is comatose and has no puposive movements. His brainstem reflexes are absent, and his spinal reflexes are present.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and purulent sputum suggest possible sepsis.
2. ARDS: The patient's hypoxia, despite increased FiO2 and PEEP, and his radiographic findings of bilateral air-space disease suggest possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest, elevated troponin, and creatine kinase levels suggest possible cardiac injury, and he may be at risk for further cardiac complications.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's myoclonus, coma, and absent brainstem reflexes suggest possible neurological injury, and he may be at risk for further neurological complications.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of diabetes and gastroparesis, and his current use of metoclopramide, suggest possible gastrointestinal complications.
6. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypotension, hypoxia, and history of hypertension suggest possible fluid and electrolyte imbalance.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and antifungals as directed.
2. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider further imaging studies to evaluate for possible neurological injury.
3. Consider further cardiac evaluation, including echocardiogram and stress test, to evaluate for possible cardiac injury.
4. Monitor the patient's fluid and electrolyte balance closely and adjust as necessary.
5. Consider further gastrointestinal evaluation, including endoscopy and manometry, to evaluate for possible gastrointestinal complications.
6. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels closely and adjust insulin therapy as necessary.
7. Consider further respiratory evaluation, including bronchoscopy and lung biopsy, to evaluate for possible respiratory complications."
