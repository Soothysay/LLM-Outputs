   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 151**] is a 35 yo woman with peripheral T-cell lymphoma C1D10 CHOP
   here with febrile neutropenia and associated hypotension.  Documented
   SBP in OMR is generally 100-110 at baseline so this is only slightly
   off her normal.
   .
   # Febrile neutropenia: No infiltrate on CXR.  No skin lesions.  Has
   some mild mucositis and mild abd pain.  Suspect likely pathogens such
   as pseudomonas, ecoli, staph.  Less likely would be cdiff (although
   possible given abd pain).
   - will rx empirically w cefepime and vanco for now
   - neupogen 480 daily per d/w onc
   - f/u pan-cultures
   - check cdiff if stools
   - BP support with IVF for now.  Goal SBP>90
   .
   # Hypotension: as above.  Suspect part of this is simply dehydration as
   pt admits to poor PO intake.  Plus has unmeasurable losses with
   tachycardia and fever.  Will not continue stress dose steroids.
   - ivf bolus for SBP<90.  consider maintenance IVF o/n.
   - rx w abx as above.
   - maintain current IV access for now
   .
   # Heme/onc: d10 s/p CHOP.  Neupogen as above.  Goal HCT>25.
   - continue allopurinol
   - apprec heme/onc recs
   .
   # LFT abnl: likely from lymphoma.  generally improving.  Trend prn
   .
   # abd pain: diffuse and mild.  Pt endorses constipation.  Rx with bowel
   regimen for now.  If has spiking fevers and worsening pain, consider
   typhlitis and make pt NPO.  Continue diet fow now.
   .
   # Prophylaxis - Bowel regimen, Boots, PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old woman with newly diagnosed T-cell lymphoma who is day 10 post-CHOP chemotherapy and admitted for febrile neutropenia. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 102°F (39°C) with a Tmax of 36.9°C (98.4°F) and a current temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F)
* Heart rate: 119 beats per minute (bpm) with a normal sinus rhythm
* Blood pressure: 111/69 mmHg, which is slightly off her normal range of 100-110 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute (bpm) with an SpO2 of 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving intravenous fluids (IVF) and has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to a hemoglobin level of 20.

The patient has a history of allergies to codeine, sulfonamides, and has experienced hives in the past. She has received antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefipime, and has a pending blood culture.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 1.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.4 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 151 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 111 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.8/31.0/1.3, lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L, calcium: 7.5 mg/dL, magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL, phosphate: 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show a normal chest X-ray (CXR). The patient's microbiology results are pending.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Febrile neutropenia: The patient is being empirically treated with cefepime and vancomycin for suspected pathogens such as Pseudomonas, E. coli, and Staphylococcus. The patient will also receive Neupogen 480 daily per day with oncology follow-up.
* Hypotension: The patient is being treated with IVF and will receive a bolus dose of IVF for a systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mmHg. The patient's blood pressure will be monitored closely, and consideration will be given to maintenance IVF if necessary.
* Heme/onc: The patient is being treated with chemotherapy and will receive Neupogen 480 daily per day with oncology follow-up. The patient's goal is to have a hemoglobin level >25%.
* LFT abnormality: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are likely related to the lymphoma and are generally improving.
* Abd pain: The patient's abdominal pain is mild and diffuse, and she is being treated with a bowel regimen. If the patient's pain worsens or she develops spiking fevers, consideration will be given to typhlitis and making her NPO.

The patient's code status is full, and she has consented to blood and ICU care. The patient's access lines are 18 and 20 gauge, and she is being considered for transfer to the floor in the morning if her blood pressure is stable."

   Mrs. [**Known lastname 151**] is a 35 yo woman with peripheral T-cell lymphoma C1D10 CHOP
   here with febrile neutropenia and associated hypotension.  Documented
   SBP in OMR is generally 100-110 at baseline so this is only slightly
   off her normal.

   # Febrile neutropenia: No infiltrate on CXR.  No skin lesions.  Has
   some mild mucositis and mild abd pain.  Suspect likely pathogens such
   as pseudomonas, ecoli, staph.  Less likely would be cdiff (although
   possible given abd pain).
   - will rx empirically w cefepime and vanco for now

   - check cdiff if stools
   - BP support with IVF for now.  Goal SBP>90
   .
   # Hypotension: as above.  Suspect part of this is simply dehydration as
   pt admits to poor PO intake.  Plus has immeasurable losses with
   tachycardia and fever.  Will not continue stress dose steroids.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old woman with newly diagnosed T-cell lymphoma, admitted to the ICU for febrile neutropenia and associated hypotension. She has been treated with CHOP chemotherapy and is currently receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefipime. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 102.1°F, heart rate of 119 bpm, and blood pressure of 111/69 mmHg. She is receiving IV fluids and has received 2 units of packed red blood cells. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 1.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 151 K/uL. She has a mild oral lesion on her upper lip mucosal membrane and mild abdominal pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's febrile neutropenia and hypotension suggest a high risk of infection. Pseudomonas, E. coli, and Staphylococcus are likely pathogens, and the patient is receiving empirical antibiotics.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, and she is receiving IV fluids to support her blood pressure. If her blood pressure does not improve, she may require further treatment, such as vasopressors.
3. Cardiac Silhouette Abnormality: The patient's CXR shows a concern for an abnormal cardiac silhouette, which may be due to increased fluid in the lungs or patient rotation. An echocardiogram is planned to further evaluate.
4. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation, which may worsen her abdominal pain. A bowel regimen has been started, and she will be monitored for further improvement.
5. Mucositis: The patient has mild mucositis, which may be due to her chemotherapy treatment. Acyclovir has been started to treat a presumed oral HSV infection.
6. Typhlitis: The patient's abdominal pain may worsen, and she may develop typhlitis, a life-threatening complication of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.
7. C. difficile Colitis: The patient's abdominal pain and constipation may be due to C. difficile colitis, which requires prompt treatment with antibiotics.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for complications related to her underlying disease and treatment. Close monitoring and prompt treatment of any complications are essential to ensure her safe and effective care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 151**] is a 35 yo woman with peripheral T-cell lymphoma C1D10 CHOP
   here with febrile neutropenia and associated hypotension.  Documented
   SBP in OMR is generally 100-110 at baseline so this is only slightly
   off her normal.
   .
   # Febrile neutropenia: No infiltrate on CXR.  No skin lesions.  Has
   some mild mucositis and mild abd pain.  Suspect likely pathogens such
   as pseudomonas, ecoli, staph.  Less likely would be cdiff (although
   possible given abd pain).
   - will rx empirically w cefepime and vanco for now
   - neupogen decreased to 300 x1 per onc request
   - f/u pan-cultures  --
   - will reculture now given fevers and rigors
   - check cdiff if stools
   - BP support with IVF for now.  Goal SBP>90
   - Hct holding above 25 (goal )
   .
   # Hypotension: as above.  Suspect part of this is simply dehydration as
   pt admits to poor PO intake.  Plus has immeasurable losses with
   tachycardia and fever.  Will not continue stress dose steroids.
   - ivf bolus for SBP<90.  consider maintenance IVF o/n.
   - rx w abx as above.
   -will check PM Hct and lytes.  Transfuse to keep Hct >25
   - maintain current IV access for now
   .
   # CXR
 concern for abnormal cardiac silhouette based on CXR.
   Radiology feels it may be due to increased fluid in lungs vs. rotation
   of patient.  Will obtain Echo to further eval.
   .
   # Heme/onc: d10 s/p CHOP.  Neupogen as above.  Goal HCT>25.
   - low uric acid so d/c allopurinol per onc rec.
   - apprec heme/onc recs
   .
   # LFT abnl: likely from lymphoma.  generally improving.  Trend prn
   # abd pain: diffuse and mild and improved with BM.   Pt endorses
   constipation.  Rx with bowel regimen for now.  If has spiking fevers
   and worsening pain, consider typhlitis and make pt NPO.  Continue diet

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old woman with peripheral T-cell lymphoma who is currently admitted to the ICU due to febrile neutropenia and associated hypotension. She has been experiencing fevers throughout the day and night, with a temperature spike to 104.3°F earlier in the day. Her blood cultures are pending, and she has received antibiotics, including cefepime and vancomycin. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 122 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 106/49 mmHg. She has received IV fluids and is being monitored closely for signs of dehydration.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's febrile neutropenia and hypotension increase her risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and even death.
2. Infection: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she has received antibiotics, but the risk of infection remains high. Pseudomonas, E. coli, and Staphylococcus aureus are potential pathogens that could cause infection.
3. Dehydration: The patient's poor oral intake and tachycardia increase her risk of dehydration, which can lead to hypotension and organ dysfunction.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, and she is at risk of developing hypotension, which can lead to organ dysfunction and even death.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac silhouette on the CXR is concerning, and an echocardiogram has been ordered to further evaluate her cardiac function.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and she is at risk of developing respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by her underlying lymphoma and chemotherapy.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal pain and constipation increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
8. Mucositis: The patient's mucositis is a potential complication of chemotherapy, and she is at risk of developing oral and gastrointestinal mucositis.
9. Catheter-related complications: The patient has IV lines in place, and she is at risk of developing catheter-related complications, such as infection or bleeding.
10. Transfusion reactions: The patient's need for transfusions increases her risk of developing transfusion reactions, which can be life-threatening.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and she requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 151**] is a 35 yo woman with peripheral T-cell lymphoma C1D10 CHOP
   here with febrile neutropenia and associated hypotension.  Documented
   SBP in OMR is generally 100-110 at baseline so this is only slightly
   off her normal.
   .
   # Febrile neutropenia: No localizing infection.  No infiltrate on CXR.
   No skin lesions.  Has some mild mucositis and mild abd pain.  Suspect
   likely pathogens such as pseudomonas, ecoli, staph.
   - will rx empirically w cefepime and vanco for now
   - neupogen decreased to 300 x1 per onc request
 fup re: neupogen
   - f/u pan-cultures
   - will reculture Q 24 hrs if continues to spike fevers.  given fevers
   and rigors
   .
   # Hypotension:  Suspect part of this is simply dehydration as pt admits
   to poor PO intake.  Plus has immeasurable losses with tachycardia and
   fever.  Will not continue stress dose steroids.
   - Patient on maintenance NS @ 125.
   - rx w abx as above.
   - Transfuse to keep Hct >25
   - maintain current IV access for now
   .
   # CXR
 concern for abnormal cardiac silhouette based on CXR.
   Radiology feels it may be due to increased fluid in lungs vs. rotation
   of patient.  Will obtain Echo to further eval.
   .
   # Heme/onc: d10 s/p CHOP.  Neupogen as above.  Goal HCT>25.
   - low uric acid so discontinued allopurinol per onc rec.
   - apprec heme/onc recs

   # LFT abnl: likely from lymphoma.  generally improving.  Trend prn
   .
   # abd pain: diffuse and mild and improved with BM.   Pt endorses
   constipation.  Rx with bowel regimen for now.  If has spiking fevers
   and worsening pain, consider typhlitis and make pt NPO.  Continue diet
   fow now.
   .
   # REN -- repleting lytes as necessary

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 35-year-old woman with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, is currently in the ICU with febrile neutropenia and associated hypotension. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 103.3°C (104.3°F) with spikes throughout the day and night
* Heart rate: 122 bpm (normal range: 99-132 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 106/49 mmHg (normal range: 84/19-112/70 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 33 inspirations per minute (normal range: 18-34 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 92% (room air)

The patient's physical examination reveals a small, shallow ulceration on the inside of her upper lip, white plaques consistent with thrush on her buccal mucosa, and no erythema or thrush visualized at the back of her throat. Her lungs are clear, and her abdomen is soft with no masses.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 1.7 K/uL (normal range: 4.5-11.0 K/uL)
* Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL (normal range: 12.0-16.0 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 151 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 20 mEq/L (normal range: 7-20 mEq/L)
* Glucose: 111 mg/dL (normal range: 70-110 mg/dL)

The patient is being treated for febrile neutropenia with empiric antibiotics, including cefepime and vancomycin. She is also receiving antifungal treatment for presumed oral herpes simplex virus (HSV) and thrush.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's febrile neutropenia and associated hypotension increase her risk of developing sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to an infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and decreased oxygen saturation may indicate respiratory failure, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's abnormal cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray may indicate cardiac involvement, which could lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's mild abdominal pain, constipation, and mucositis increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal complications such as typhlitis, bowel obstruction, or perforation.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels may indicate renal failure, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
6. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases her risk of developing hemorrhagic complications such as petechiae, ecchymoses, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 35-year-old woman with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, is being treated for febrile neutropenia and associated hypotension. She has been experiencing fever spikes throughout the day and night, with a temperature of 104.3°F. She reports a mild sore throat, mild abdominal pain, and difficulty breathing when febrile. Her vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 122 bpm and blood pressure of 106/49 mmHg. She has been prescribed antibiotics, including cefepime and vancomycin, and is being treated with cooling blankets, Tylenol, and ibuprofen for fever control.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension are consistent with sepsis, a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment.
2. Infection: The patient's neutropenia and febrile neutropenia increase her risk of infection, particularly with opportunistic pathogens such as pseudomonas, ecoli, and staph.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's abnormal cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray may indicate cardiac dysfunction or increased fluid in the lungs, which requires further evaluation with an echocardiogram.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and decreased oxygen saturation may indicate respiratory failure, which requires close monitoring and possible intubation.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's mild abdominal pain and constipation may indicate gastrointestinal complications, such as typhlitis, which requires prompt recognition and treatment.
6. Mucositis: The patient's oral mucositis may increase her risk of infection and require treatment with antiviral medication and lidocaine swish.
7. Thrush: The patient's white plaques on the buccal mucosa may indicate thrush, which requires treatment with nystatin swish and swallow.
8. Dehydration: The patient's poor oral intake and immeasurable losses with tachycardia and fever may indicate dehydration, which requires close monitoring and possible fluid replacement.
9. Renal dysfunction: The patient's abnormal renal function may indicate renal dysfunction, which requires close monitoring and possible dialysis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy with cefepime and vancomycin to cover possible pathogens.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely, including temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure.
3. Perform regular blood cultures and urine cultures to monitor for infection.
4. Consider adding an antifungal medication if the patient's fevers persist despite antibiotic therapy.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status with an echocardiogram and consider intubation if respiratory failure occurs.
6. Manage the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms with a bowel regimen and consider typhlitis if symptoms worsen.
7. Treat the patient's mucositis with antiviral medication and lidocaine swish.
8. Treat the patient's thrush with nystatin swish and swallow.
9. Monitor the patient's fluid status closely and consider fluid replacement if dehydration occurs.
10. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider dialysis if renal dysfunction occurs."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of sepsis. She has a history of immunocompromised status and has been experiencing fever, rigors, and sore throat. Her laboratory results show neutropenia, hypotension, and constipation. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and her granulocyte count is pending. She has also developed thrush and is being treated with Nystatin.

Assessment:

The patient is at risk for several medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: Given her history of immunocompromised status and the presence of sepsis, the patient is at risk for developing sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
2. Neutropenia: The patient's neutropenia may increase her risk for developing infections, particularly bacterial and fungal infections.
3. Constipation: The patient's constipation may lead to bowel obstruction, abdominal distension, and decreased mobility.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to sepsis or dehydration, and may require treatment with vasopressors and fluid resuscitation.
5. Thrush: The patient's thrush may be a sign of immunocompromise and may increase her risk for developing fungal infections.

Plan:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics pending the results of the patient's granulocyte count.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure, and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
3. Provide supportive care, including hydration, nutrition, and pain management.
4. Monitor the patient's constipation and provide treatment as necessary.
5. Consider transferring the patient to a higher-level care unit, such as an intensive care unit, if her condition worsens or if she requires more intensive treatment.
6. Monitor the patient's thrush and provide treatment as necessary."
