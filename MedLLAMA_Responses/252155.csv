   ECHO
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %)
   secondary to extensive akinesis involving the apex and anterior septum;
   there is severe hypkinesis of the anterior free wall, inferior septum,
   and inferior free wall. The basal half of the posterior and lateral
   walls contracts normally. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. A bileaflet aortic
   valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
   seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
   acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct of unknown
   acuity; inferior hypokinesis; findings consistent with multivessel
   obstructive coronary [**Last Name (un) **] disease
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea prior
   to presentation. Nevertheless no evidence of hypoxia on initial
   presentation. Alternatively, the evidence of systolic failure and
   hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent ischemic event (but no q
   waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination of these two. Less likely
   tamponade, acidosis, PE.
   - needed pressor support overnight, with effective weaning.
   - cte ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - try to ween propofol to better assess brain/seizure activity and f/u
   neuro recs today
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin for AVR and
   PTT 60-90.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Overnight with decreased u/o.
   Most likely decreased forward flow in the setting of poor EF. No
   evidence of crackles on exam or LE edema, but exam is limited. If blood
   pressure normalizes then may try furosemide to improve forward flow and
   increase renal perfusion. Ionotropic support was briefly necessary.
   Alternative etiology is decreased volume but PCWP is elevated on ECHO.
   BUN/Cre is too high to suggest intrinsic renal cause such as ATN, but
   given his HypoTN this is a possibility.
   # Possible Cardiogenic shock: Has edema and uop now down to almost zero
   - BPs stable and appearts fluid overloaded on exam so will try lasix
   today to increase uop (bolus X 1) follow UOP today
   #
twitching
 movements noted with weaning sedation: concern for
   seizure, but no coordinated movements were noted. His neuro exam was
   unchanged, i.e. fixed/dialated pupils, no doll
s eye.  EEG was
   recording so it should provide clear information. Resolved with
   restarting of sedation. Propofol was chosen for its shorter
 life in
   case need to wean again.
   - F/u neurology recs and wean down propofol prior to their exam to
   allow them to assess seizures.
   # Anemia: HCT this am at 27 down from 31 on admission. VS stable. Will
   monitor, if continues to decrease may need scan for bleeding.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c
d as placed in the ED but
   will reassess for PIVs prior to d/c
ing.. Add PiVs for more access.
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin ggt
   # CODE: Full. Had long discussion with daughters regarding [**Name2 (NI) **]
   prognosis. They are actively consulting their rabbi [**First Name (Titles) 1986**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6677**] of
   care. Family may not want to increase care but may not be comfortable
   withdrawing care.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 6668**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health care proxy. Above discussed
   with primary care physician: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 6684**]. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). CCU taem.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Doing poorly, with seizures off sedation by EEG, few reflexes.
   Plan:
   1. Neurology consult for seizure meds
   2. Diuresis given CXR findings, oliguria
   3. Continue close contact with the family - poor prognosis explained to
   them today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea prior
   to presentation. Nevertheless no evidence of hypoxia on initial
   presentation. Alternatively, the evidence of systolic failure and
   hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent ischemic event (but no q
   waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination of these two. Less likely
   tamponade, acidosis, PE.
   - needed pressor support overnight, with effective weaning.
   - cte ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - try to ween propofol to better assess brain/seizure activity and f/u
   neuro recs today
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin for AVR and
   PTT 60-90.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Overnight with decreased u/o.
   Most likely decreased forward flow in the setting of poor EF. No
   evidence of crackles on exam or LE edema, but exam is limited. If blood
   pressure normalizes then may try furosemide to improve forward flow and
   increase renal perfusion. Ionotropic support was briefly necessary.
   Alternative etiology is decreased volume but PCWP is elevated on ECHO.
   BUN/Cre is too high to suggest intrinsic renal cause such as ATN, but
   given his HypoTN this is a possibility.
   # Possible Cardiogenic shock: Has edema and uop now down to almost zero
   - BPs stable and appearts fluid overloaded on exam so will try lasix
   today to increase uop (bolus X 1) follow UOP today
   #
twitching
 movements noted with weaning sedation: concern for
   seizure, but no coordinated movements were noted. His neuro exam was
   unchanged, i.e. fixed/dialated pupils, no doll
s eye.  EEG was
   recording so it should provide clear information. Resolved with
   restarting of sedation. Propofol was chosen for its shorter
 life in
   case need to wean again.
   - F/u neurology recs and wean down propofol prior to their exam to
   allow them to assess seizures.
   # Anemia: HCT this am at 27 down from 31 on admission. VS stable. Will
   monitor, if continues to decrease may need scan for bleeding.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c
d as placed in the ED but
   will reassess for PIVs prior to d/c
ing.. Add PiVs for more access.
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin ggt
   # CODE: Full. Had long discussion with daughters regarding [**Name2 (NI) **]
   prognosis. They are actively consulting their rabbi [**First Name (Titles) 1986**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6677**] of
   care. Family may not want to increase care but may not be comfortable
   withdrawing care.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 6668**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health care proxy. Above discussed
   with primary care physician: [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 6684**]. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). CCU taem.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Doing poorly, with seizures off sedation by EEG, few reflexes.
   Plan:
   1. Neurology consult for seizure meds
   2. Diuresis given CXR findings, oliguria
   3. Continue close contact with the family - poor prognosis explained to
   them today

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), peripheral artery disease (PAD), and a recent cardiac arrest. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple medical conditions.

The patient's recent events include:

* Hypothermia, which was treated with fluids and warming measures
* Cardiac arrest, which was likely caused by respiratory arrest and systolic failure
* Electrolyte imbalance, which was treated with correction of potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels
* Coagulopathy, which was treated with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K
* Acute kidney injury (AKI), which is likely caused by decreased forward flow and elevated left ventricular filling pressure
* Cardiogenic shock, which is characterized by hypotension, oliguria, and edema

The patient's current medications include:

* Heparin for atrial fibrillation and prophylaxis
* Propofol for sedation and seizure prophylaxis
* Insulin sliding scale for glycemic control
* Lasix for diuresis

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels
* Low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels
* Elevated troponin-T levels
* Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs)

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct on echocardiogram
* Mild mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation on echocardiogram

The patient's clinical condition is complicated by:

* Seizure activity, which is being treated with propofol and anticonvulsant medication
* Cardiogenic shock, which is being treated with diuresis and vasopressor support
* AKI, which is being treated with fluid management and hemodynamic support
* Coagulopathy, which is being treated with correction of electrolyte imbalances and anticoagulant therapy

The patient's prognosis is poor, and the family is actively consulting with a rabbi regarding their options for end-of-life care. The patient's code status is full code, and the family is being counseled regarding the potential for further interventions.

Based on this information, potential medical complications that could arise include:

* Further cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest
* Worsening of cardiogenic shock or AKI
* Development of sepsis or multi-organ failure
* Bleeding complications due to coagulopathy
* Worsening of seizure activity or development of status epilepticus
* Development of respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Asystolic arrest: Likely etiology is respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest. Unlikely [**1-2**] PE given profound coagulopathy. He was
   hyperkalemic, but this may very well have been secondary to the arrest
   as opposed to the cause of it. There is no evidence of ST-segment
   deviation on ECG nor were there any regional WMAs to suggest acute MI.
   There was no tamponade on echocardiogram. Now on norepinephrine for BP
   support. Initially on therapeutic hypothermia protocol, but given
   profound coagulopathy, this was discontinued. Neuro exam concerning. On
   light sedation, pt is nonrepsonsive with fixed pupils and no corneal
   reflex bilaterally.
   - attempt to wean norepi
   - attempt to wean mechanical ventilation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC.
   - Vitamin K 10 IV x1
   - 4 units FFP
   - monitor INR as he has mechanical aortic valve
   .
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Unlikely to be [**1-2**] arrest
   alone. No evidence of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, although he has had
   decreased PO intake [**1-2**] some swallowing dysfunction. has already
   received 2.5L IVF.
   - monitor Cr
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   .
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, likely needs to be re-sited once coagulopathy
   has resolved
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS: no indication for heparin given coagulopathy
   .
   # CODE: Full. Had long discussion with daughters regarding [**Name2 (NI) **]
   prognosis. They are actively consulting their rabbi [**First Name (Titles) 1986**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6677**] of
   care.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Asystolic arrest: Likely etiology is respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest. Unlikely [**1-2**] PE given profound coagulopathy. He was
   hyperkalemic, but this may very well have been secondary to the arrest
   as opposed to the cause of it. There is no evidence of ST-segment
   deviation on ECG nor were there any regional WMAs to suggest acute MI.
   There was no tamponade on echocardiogram. Now on norepinephrine for BP
   support. Initially on therapeutic hypothermia protocol, but given
   profound coagulopathy, this was discontinued. Neuro exam concerning. On
   light sedation, pt is nonrepsonsive with fixed pupils and no corneal
   reflex bilaterally.
   - attempt to wean norepi
   - attempt to wean mechanical ventilation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC.
   - Vitamin K 10 IV x1
   - 4 units FFP
   - monitor INR as he has mechanical aortic valve
   .
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Unlikely to be [**1-2**] arrest
   alone. No evidence of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, although he has had
   decreased PO intake [**1-2**] some swallowing dysfunction. has already
   received 2.5L IVF.
   - monitor Cr
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   .
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, likely needs to be re-sited once coagulopathy
   has resolved
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS: no indication for heparin given coagulopathy
   .
   # CODE: Full. Had long discussion with daughters regarding [**Name2 (NI) **]
   prognosis. They are actively consulting their rabbi [**First Name (Titles) 1986**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6677**] of

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral artery disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated and intubated. His initial assessment revealed a profound coagulopathy, likely caused by a combination of warfarin and antibiotic use. He was treated with vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, and heparin. His cardiac function is compromised, with an ejection fraction of 20% and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. He is on norepinephrine for blood pressure support and mechanical ventilation for respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications due to coagulopathy: The patient's INR is 2.2, which is still elevated, and he is at risk for bleeding complications, particularly if his coagulopathy is not adequately managed.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is at risk for further kidney damage due to his underlying medical conditions and potential for hypovolemia.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a history of antibiotic use, and his white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and he is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's neurologic exam is concerning, with fixed pupils and no corneal reflexes, which may indicate a severe neurological injury.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and he is at risk for respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or respiratory failure.
7. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised, and he is at risk for infection, particularly with the use of antibiotics and other medications.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of diabetes and peripheral artery disease, which may increase his risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea or constipation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulopathy and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his fluid management and medication dosing accordingly.
3. Consider further evaluation for underlying infections, such as blood cultures or imaging studies.
4. Continue to optimize the patient's cardiac function, including adjusting his medication regimen and monitoring his cardiac rhythm.
5. Consider further evaluation of the patient's neurological status, including imaging studies or electrophysiological testing.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as necessary.
7. Consider prophylactic antibiotics for the patient's respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts.
8. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust his insulin regimen as necessary to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia."

   ECHO
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %)
   secondary to extensive akinesis involving the apex and anterior septum;
   there is severe hypkinesis of the anterior free wall, inferior septum,
   and inferior free wall. The basal half of the posterior and lateral
   walls contracts normally. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. A bileaflet aortic
   valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
   seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
   acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct of unknown
   acuity; inferior hypokinesis; findings consistent with multivessel
   obstructive coronary [**Last Name (un) **] disease
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea prior
   to presentation. Nevertheless no evidence of hypoxia on initial
   presentation. Alternatively, the evidence of systolic failure and
   hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent ischemic event (but no q
   waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination of these two. Less likely
   tamponade, acidosis, PE.
   - needed pressor support overnight, with effective weaning.
   .
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin for AVR and
   PTT 60-90.
   .
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Overnight with decreased u/o.
   Most likely decreased forward flow in the setting of poor EF. No
   evidence of crackles on exam or LE edema, but exam is limited. If blood
   pressure normalizes then may try furosemide to improve forward flow and
   increase renal perfusion. Ionotropic support may be necessary.
   Alternative etiology is decreased volume but PCWP is elevated on ECHO.
   BUN/Cre is too high to suggest intrinsic renal cause such as ATN, but
   given his HypoTN this is a possibility.
   - sediment and u/lytes

twitching
 movements noted with weaning sedation: concern for
   seizure, but no coordinated movements were noted. His neuro exam was
   unchanged, i.e. fixed/dialated pupils, no doll

   recording so it should provide clear information. Resolved with
   restarting of sedation. Propofol was chosen for its shorter
 life in
   case need to wean again.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %)
   secondary to extensive akinesis involving the apex and anterior septum;
   there is severe hypkinesis of the anterior free wall, inferior septum,
   and inferior free wall. The basal half of the posterior and lateral
   walls contracts normally. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. A bileaflet aortic
   valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
   seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
   acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea prior
   to presentation. Nevertheless no evidence of hypoxia on initial
   presentation. Alternatively, the evidence of systolic failure and
   hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent ischemic event (but no q
   waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination of these two. Less likely
   tamponade, acidosis, PE.
   - needed pressor support overnight, with effective weaning.
   .
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin for AVR and
   PTT 60-90.
   .
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Overnight with decreased u/o.
   Most likely decreased forward flow in the setting of poor EF. No
   evidence of crackles on exam or LE edema, but exam is limited. If blood
   pressure normalizes then may try furosemide to improve forward flow and
   increase renal perfusion. Ionotropic support may be necessary.
   Alternative etiology is decreased volume but PCWP is elevated on ECHO.
   BUN/Cre is too high to suggest intrinsic renal cause such as ATN, but
   given his HypoTN this is a possibility.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral artery disease, and a history of cardiac arrest. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of hypothermia, coagulopathy, and acute kidney injury. He received FFP and vitamin K, and his international normalized ratio (INR) improved from 22 to 2.2. He was also started on heparin and propofol for sedation. His cardiac status is complicated, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%, and evidence of extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct and multivessel obstructive coronary disease. He has a bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis and mild mitral regurgitation.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Continued cardiac failure and hypotension
	* Increased risk of arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation
	* Potential for further myocardial infarction or worsening of existing damage
2. Renal complications:
	* Continued acute kidney injury and potential for further deterioration
	* Increased risk of chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease
3. Coagulopathy:
	* Risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage
	* Potential for further coagulopathy if heparin is discontinued
4. Respiratory complications:
	* Risk of respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation
	* Potential for pneumonia or other respiratory infections
5. Neurological complications:
	* Risk of seizure activity or status epilepticus
	* Potential for further neurological deterioration, including stroke or encephalopathy
6. Infection:
	* Risk of sepsis or septic shock
	* Potential for further infection, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or bloodstream infection
7. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
	* Potential for further gastrointestinal complications, including nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
8. Hemodynamic instability:
	* Risk of hypotension or hypertension
	* Potential for further hemodynamic instability, including cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   ECHO
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %)
   secondary to extensive akinesis involving the apex and anterior septum;
   there is severe hypkinesis of the anterior free wall, inferior septum,
   and inferior free wall. The basal half of the posterior and lateral
   walls contracts normally. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. A bileaflet aortic
   valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
   seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
   acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct of unknown
   acuity; inferior hypokinesis; findings consistent with multivessel
   obstructive coronary [**Last Name (un) **] disease
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea prior
   to presentation. Nevertheless no evidence of hypoxia on initial
   presentation. Alternatively, the evidence of systolic failure and
   hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent ischemic event (but no q
   waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination of these two. Less likely
   tamponade, acidosis, PE.
   - needed pressor support overnight, with effective weaning.
   - cte ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - try to ween propofol to better assess brain/seizure activity and f/u
   neuro recs today
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin for AVR and
   PTT 60-90.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Overnight with decreased u/o.
   Most likely decreased forward flow in the setting of poor EF. No
   evidence of crackles on exam or LE edema, but exam is limited. If blood
   pressure normalizes then may try furosemide to improve forward flow and
   increase renal perfusion. Ionotropic support was briefly necessary.
   Alternative etiology is decreased volume but PCWP is elevated on ECHO.
   BUN/Cre is too high to suggest intrinsic renal cause such as ATN, but
   given his HypoTN this is a possibility.
   # Possible Cardiogenic shock: Has edema and uop now down to almost zero
   - BPs stable and appearts fluid overloaded on exam so will try lasix
   today to increase uop (bolus X 1) follow UOP today
   #
twitching
 movements noted with weaning sedation: concern for
   seizure, but no coordinated movements were noted. His neuro exam was
   unchanged, i.e. fixed/dialated pupils, no doll
s eye.  EEG was
   recording so it should provide clear information. Resolved with
   restarting of sedation. Propofol was chosen for its shorter
 life in
   case need to wean again.
   - F/u neurology recs and wean down propofol prior to their exam to
   allow them to assess seizures.
   # Anemia: HCT this am at 27 down from 31 on admission. VS stable. Will
   monitor, if continues to decrease may need scan for bleeding.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c
d as placed in the ED but
   will reassess for PIVs prior to d/c
ing.. Add PiVs for more access.
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin ggt

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Cardiovascular Status:**

* The patient has extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct of unknown acuity, with inferior hypokinesis and multivessel obstructive coronary disease.
* Left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %) with extensive akinesis involving the apex and anterior septum.
* The patient has a bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis with trace aortic regurgitation and mild (1+) mitral regurgitation.
* The patient is at risk for cardiogenic shock due to poor left ventricular function and elevated left ventricular filling pressure.

**Coagulopathy:**

* The patient has a coagulopathy likely caused by a combination of warfarin and antibiotic use, which has resolved with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K.
* The patient is currently on heparin for atrioventricular valve replacement and prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 60-90 seconds.

**Renal Status:**

* The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL from 1.0 mg/dL on admission.
* The patient's blood pressure is stable, but urine output is decreased, and he has edema, which may indicate cardiogenic shock or decreased forward flow.
* The patient's BUN/Cr ratio is too high to suggest intrinsic renal cause such as acute tubular necrosis, but given his hypotension, this is a possibility.

**Neurological Status:**

* The patient has fixed and dilated pupils, no doll's eye reflex, and no coordinated movements were noted, which raises concern for seizure activity.
* The patient's EEG was recorded, and the results are pending.

**Other Complications:**

* The patient has anemia with a hematocrit level of 27% down from 31% on admission.
* The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and is at risk for hypoglycemia.
* The patient has a femoral line, which may need to be discontinued and replaced with peripheral intravenous lines (PiVs) for more access.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Cardiogenic shock due to poor left ventricular function and elevated left ventricular filling pressure.
* Seizure activity due to the patient's neurological status.
* Renal failure due to acute kidney injury or decreased forward flow.
* Hypotension due to cardiogenic shock or coagulopathy.
* Infection due to stress ulcer or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and coagulopathy.

**Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust therapy as needed.
* Wean the patient off propofol and assess seizure activity.
* Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust therapy as needed.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust therapy as needed.
* Consider adding PiVs for more access and discontinuing the femoral line.
* Continue to monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust therapy as needed.
* Consider holding PO hypoglycemics and starting insulin sliding scale."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ECHO
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF= 20-30 %)
   secondary to extensive akinesis involving the apex and anterior septum;
   there is severe hypkinesis of the anterior free wall, inferior septum,
   and inferior free wall. The basal half of the posterior and lateral
   walls contracts normally. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size is normal. with depressed free wall contractility. The
   aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. A bileaflet aortic
   valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well
   seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to
   acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be
   significantly UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Impression: extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct of unknown
   acuity; inferior hypokinesis; findings consistent with multivessel
   obstructive coronary [**Last Name (un) **] disease
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea prior
   to presentation. Nevertheless no evidence of hypoxia on initial
   presentation. Alternatively, the evidence of systolic failure and
   hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent ischemic event (but no q
   waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination of these two. Less likely
   tamponade, acidosis, PE.
   - needed pressor support overnight, with effective weaning.
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin for AVR and
   PTT 60-90.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Overnight with decreased u/o.
   Most likely decreased forward flow in the setting of poor EF. No
   evidence of crackles on exam or LE edema, but exam is limited. If blood
   pressure normalizes then may try furosemide to improve forward flow and
   increase renal perfusion. Ionotropic support may be necessary.
   Alternative etiology is decreased volume but PCWP is elevated on ECHO.
   BUN/Cre is too high to suggest intrinsic renal cause such as ATN, but
   given his HypoTN this is a possibility.
   - sediment and u/lytes
   #
twitching
 movements noted with weaning sedation: concern for
   seizure, but no coordinated movements were noted. His neuro exam was
   unchanged, i.e. fixed/dialated pupils, no doll
s eye.  EEG was
   recording so it should provide clear information. Resolved with
   restarting of sedation. Propofol was chosen for its shorter
 life in
   case need to wean again.
   # Anemia: HCT this am at 27 down from 31 on admission. VS stable. Will
   monitor, if continues to decrease may need scan for bleeding.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an elderly man with DM2 and PAD, presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He was intubated and received pressor support overnight, with effective weaning. He developed hypothermia, which was treated with FFP and vitamin K. His coagulopathy was resolved with FFP and vitamin K, and he is now on heparin for AVR and PTT 60-90.

The patient's cardiac condition is characterized by extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarct of unknown acuity, inferior hypokinesis, and findings consistent with multivessel obstructive coronary disease. His ECHO showed a severely depressed left ventricular systolic function with an LVEF of 20-30%. He also has a bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis with trace aortic regurgitation and mild (1+) mitral regurgitation.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a HCT of 27, down from 31 on admission. His glucose levels are stable, and he is on insulin sliding scale. His electrolyte levels are normal, except for a slightly elevated BUN/Cr ratio.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a pH of 7.4, pCO2 of 39, and SpO2 of 100%. He is on ventilator support with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate of 16, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's neurological status is stable, with fixed and dilated pupils, no doll's eye reflex, and no evidence of seizure activity. His EEG was recorded and is pending.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been on antibiotics for an unknown duration, and his WBC count is elevated.
2. ARF: The patient's Cr level is elevated, and he has decreased urine output.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of AFib and is at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Bleeding: The patient has a coagulopathy and is at risk for bleeding.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is on ventilator support and is at risk for respiratory failure.
6. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of seizures and is at risk for further neurological complications.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Pressor support as needed.
2. Heparin for AVR and PTT 60-90.
3. Insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.
4. Monitoring of electrolyte levels and acid-base status.
5. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and neurological function.
6. Consideration of further diagnostic tests, such as an echocardiogram or cardiac catheterization, to evaluate the patient's cardiac condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated, and received fluid resuscitation, pressor support, and antibiotics.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of coagulopathy, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.2 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 42.0 seconds. He was treated with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K, and is now on heparin for atrial fibrillation (AFib) and aortic valve replacement (AVR).

The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 106 mg/dL. He has decreased urine output and is at risk for acute kidney injury (AKI).

The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows evidence of extensive anteroseptal-apical myocardial infarction (MI) with inferior hypokinesis, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20-30%. He has a bileaflet aortic valve prosthesis and mild mitral regurgitation.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a tidal volume (TV) of 550 mL and a respiratory rate (RR) of 16 breaths per minute. He is receiving oxygen therapy via an endotracheal tube.

The patient's neurologic status is stable, with fixed and dilated pupils and no doll's eye movement. He has no evidence of seizure activity, but did have twitching movements noted with weaning of sedation.

The patient's medication list includes:

* Heparin sodium
* Propofol
* Insulin sliding scale
* Furosemide (if blood pressure normalizes)

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to decreased urine output and elevated BUN and creatinine levels
* Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or worsening of cardiac function
* Respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or worsening of oxygenation
* Neurologic complications such as seizures, increased intracranial pressure, or worsening of neurologic status
* Infection complications such as sepsis, urinary tract infection, or pneumonia
* Bleeding complications due to coagulopathy and heparin therapy

The patient's care plan includes:

* Continuing pressor support and monitoring of blood pressure
* Monitoring of renal function and urine output
* Continuing antibiotic therapy and monitoring for signs of infection
* Continuing cardiac monitoring and management of cardiac function
* Monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation
* Monitoring of neurologic status and seizure activity
* Continuing heparin therapy and monitoring for bleeding complications"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - BP continues to be stable w/o pressors
   - continue ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - Will continue to attempt to diurese (-1Lt) however patient has had
   decreased UOP, but responded to lasix yesterday.
   - Multidisciplinary meeting
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam per Neurology and continue to wean off
   propophol.
   - Continue EEG.
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Most likely related to CHF.
   Urine output improved with furosemide. Will continue to diurese (-1Lt).
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable at 26. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Also possible is hypoxic brain injury affecting the
   pituitary.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c
d as placed in the ED but
   will reassess for PIVs prior to d/c
ing.. Add PiVs for more access.
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin ggt
   # CODE: Full. Had long discussion with daughters regarding [**Name2 (NI) **]
   prognosis. They are actively consulting their rabbi [**First Name (Titles) 1986**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6677**] of
   care. Family may not want to increase care but may not be comfortable
   withdrawing care.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 5077**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health care proxy. I have discussed
   this plan with Dr(s).
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   More seizures today on EEG, despite Keppra load.  Oliguric.  No
   meaningful response to stimulation.  Some brainstem activity with
   occasional spontaneous breaths and a sluggish right corneal reflex.
   Plan:
   1. Palliative care consultation
   2. Family meeting today at 3 pm
   3. Mechanical ventilation, hemodynamic support for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:

   - Neuro consult regarding brain activity, recommended starting Keppra
   1500mg loading dose, 500mg following.
   - Gave 20mg IV lasix as poor UOP, not much increased, only 20cc/hr,
   gave an additional 40mg IV lasix at 3:00pm, improved UOP to 30cc/hr,
   however Crn increased to 2.3
   - Had 7 beat run of NSVT at 6pm, checked electrolytes, LFTs, lactate,
   essentially normal
   - BG decreased to 60's during the afternoon, gave two amps of D50,
   improved

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a need for mechanical ventilation and a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of asystolic cardiac arrest and is at risk for further cardiac arrests due to his underlying cardiac conditions.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate level suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential renal failure, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia, which could lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level is low, indicating hypoglycemia, which could lead to seizures, confusion, and even death if not treated promptly.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated, indicating coagulopathy, which could lead to bleeding complications.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's EEG shows generalized periodic epileptiform activity, which could indicate severe brain anoxia and poor outcomes.
9. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate level suggest the possibility of infection, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
10. Multi-organ failure: The patient's underlying conditions and complications could lead to multi-organ failure, which would be a poor prognosis.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - BP continues to be stable w/o pressors
   - continue ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - Will continue to attempt to diurese (-1Lt) however patient has had
   decreased UOP, but responded to lasix yesterday.
   - Multidisciplinary meeting
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam per Neurology and continue to wean off
   propophol.
   - Continue EEG.
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Most likely related to CHF.
   Urine output improved with furosemide. Will continue to diurese (-1Lt).
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable at 26. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Also possible is hypoxic brain injury affecting the
   pituitary.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c
d as placed in the ED but
   will reassess for PIVs prior to d/c
ing.. Add PiVs for more access.
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin ggt
   # CODE: Full. Had long discussion with daughters regarding [**Name2 (NI) **]
   prognosis. They are actively consulting their rabbi [**First Name (Titles) 1986**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6677**] of
   care. Family may not want to increase care but may not be comfortable
   withdrawing care.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of DM2, PAD, and CHF, who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He has been admitted to the ICU for ongoing management.

Key findings and concerns:

1. Respiratory support: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His SpO2 is 99%, and his ABG results indicate a pH of 7.48, PaO2 of 36, and PaCO2 of 120.
2. Cardiovascular status: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is paroxysmal in nature and remains rate-controlled. His BP is stable, but his Cr is elevated at 2.3.
3. Neurological status: The patient has generalized periodic epileptiform activity on EEG, indicating severe brain anoxia and poor outcomes. He is receiving Keppra and propofol, and his sedation is being weaned.
4. Renal function: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), with a Cr of 2.3. His urine output has improved with furosemide, but he is still producing less than 1 L of urine per day.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, likely related to warfarin and antibiotic use. He has received FFP and VitK, and is now on heparin for AVR and PTT 60-90.
6. Anemia: The patient's HCT is stable at 26, and his VS are stable.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient has had two episodes of hypoglycemia, with a glucose level of 15 at 1 am. He is receiving D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
8. DM2: The patient's DM2 is being managed with insulin sliding scale and holding PO hypoglycemics.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated Cr and decreased urine output suggest possible sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he may be at risk for respiratory failure if his FiO2 is decreased or if he experiences further respiratory compromise.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's atrial fibrillation and elevated Cr suggest possible cardiac arrest, which could lead to further cardiovascular complications.
4. Neurological decline: The patient's generalized periodic epileptiform activity on EEG indicates severe brain anoxia and poor outcomes, which could lead to further neurological decline.
5. Renal failure: The patient's ARF is likely to continue, and he may require further interventions to improve his renal function.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy could lead to further bleeding complications, particularly if he experiences further trauma or surgical procedures.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia could lead to further cardiovascular complications, particularly if his HCT falls below 20.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for a range of medical complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, neurological decline, renal failure, coagulopathy, and anemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - BP continues to be stable w/o pressors
   - continue ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - Will continue to attempt to diurese (-1Lt) however patient has had
   decreased UOP, but responded to lasix yesterday.
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam per Neurology and continue to wean off
   propophol.
   - Continue EEG.
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Most likely related to CHF.
   Urine output improved with furosemide. Will continue to diurese (-1Lt).
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable at 26. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c
d as placed in the ED but
   will reassess for PIVs prior to d/c
ing.. Add PiVs for more access.
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin ggt
   # CODE: Full. Had long discussion with daughters regarding [**Name2 (NI) **]
   prognosis. They are actively consulting their rabbi [**First Name (Titles) 1986**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6677**] of
   care. Family may not want to increase care but may not be comfortable
   withdrawing care.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on a ventilator, but the ABG results show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 300, indicating respiratory failure. The patient's lung sounds are normal, but the ventilator settings indicate that the patient may be at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and the patient has had a history of cardiac arrest. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but the patient's cardiac function is compromised.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 2.3, indicating renal failure. The patient's urine output has improved with furosemide, but the patient is still at risk for further kidney damage.
4. Seizure activity: The patient has had generalized periodic epileptiform activity on EEG, which is associated with poor outcomes. The patient is being treated with levetiracetam, but the patient's seizure activity may continue to be a concern.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient has had multiple episodes of hypoglycemia, and the etiology is unclear. The patient is being treated with D50 infusions and D5 KVO, but the patient may be at risk for further hypoglycemic episodes.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which is likely related to warfarin and antibiotic use. The patient is being treated with heparin, but the patient may be at risk for further bleeding complications.
7. Anemia: The patient has a stable hematocrit, but the patient may be at risk for further blood loss due to the patient's coagulopathy and renal failure.
8. Sepsis: The patient has had multiple episodes of hypoglycemia and hypotension, which may indicate sepsis. The patient's labs show elevated lactate levels and a high white blood cell count, which may indicate sepsis.
9. Multi-organ dysfunction: The patient has multi-organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiac, renal, and hepatic dysfunction. The patient's prognosis is poor, and the patient may be at risk for further organ dysfunction.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue ventilation and wean the patient off the ventilator as able.
2. Continue to diurese the patient and monitor the patient's urine output.
3. Continue to treat the patient's seizure activity with levetiracetam and monitor the patient's EEG.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust the patient's insulin sliding scale as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulopathy and bleeding risk and adjust the patient's anticoagulation therapy as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and bleeding risk and transfuse the patient as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's sepsis and adjust the patient's antibiotic therapy as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's multi-organ dysfunction and adjust the patient's care plan as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of  respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - BP stable wo pressors
   - cte ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - Will continue to diurese (-1Lt).
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability). Will continue Levitiracetam and continue to wean off
   propophol. Continue EEG.
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Most likely related to CHF.
   Urine output improved with furosemide. Will continue to diurese (-1Lt).
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable at 26. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c
d as placed in the ED but
   will reassess for PIVs prior to d/c
ing.. Add PiVs for more access.
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin ggt
   # CODE: Full. Had long discussion with daughters regarding [**Name2 (NI) **]
   prognosis. They are actively consulting their rabbi [**First Name (Titles) 1986**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6677**] of
   care. Family may not want to increase care but may not be comfortable
   withdrawing care.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly man with a complex medical history, including DM2, PAD, and CHF. He presented with asystolic cardiac arrest and has been in the ICU for several days.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 135/56 mmHg, heart rate of 99 bpm, and respiratory rate of 19 inspirations per minute. His oxygen saturation is 99% on a ventilator with a FiO2 of 40%. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is currently rate-controlled.

The patient has a significant neurological component, with a history of seizure activity and an EEG that suggests severe brain anoxia. He is currently receiving anticonvulsant therapy and will continue to be monitored for seizure activity.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL. He has been receiving diuretic therapy and has shown some improvement in urine output.

The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with a range of 40-84 mg/dL. He is receiving D50 infusions and D5 KVO to maintain euglycemia.

The patient has a coagulopathy, which is likely related to warfarin and antibiotic use. He has received FFP and vitamin K, and his PTT is currently within the normal range.

The patient's anemia is likely related to his underlying medical conditions, and his hemoglobin level is stable at 26.6 g/dL.

The patient's code status is full code, and his family is actively consulting with a rabbi regarding his prognosis and end-of-life care.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is receiving antibiotics, which may increase his risk of developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which may be complicated by respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of asystolic cardiac arrest and may be at risk for further cardiac arrests.
4. Neurological deterioration: The patient has a history of seizure activity and may be at risk for further neurological deterioration.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and he may be at risk for further renal failure.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, and he may be at risk for further hypoglycemic episodes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), cardiac arrest, coma, and impaired skin integrity. They were started on Keppra for brain activity and received a loading dose of 1500mg followed by 500mg every 8 hours. The patient had a run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and was given IV lasix to improve urine output, which increased to 30cc/hr. However, creatinine (Cr) levels increased to 2.3. Blood glucose levels decreased to 60's during the afternoon and 15 at 1am, requiring two amps of D50. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 99bpm, and blood pressure of 135/56mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, and has an arterial line and multi-lumen line in place.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and current atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of cardiac arrest.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine (Cr) levels have increased to 2.3, indicating potential kidney damage.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have decreased to 15, requiring urgent treatment to prevent further complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, with mechanical ventilation in place. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging.
5. Skin integrity issues: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of skin breakdown and infection.
6. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and should receive prophylactic anticoagulation.
7. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient's critical illness and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of stress ulcers, requiring prophylactic medication.
8. VAP prophylaxis: The patient's endotracheal tube increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), requiring prophylactic antibiotics and proper tube care.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor blood glucose levels closely and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
2. Continue Keppra therapy as prescribed.
3. Monitor creatinine levels and adjust diuretic therapy as needed.
4. Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor respiratory status closely.
5. Implement DVT prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis as prescribed.
6. Monitor for signs of skin breakdown and infection.
7. Consider weaning from the ventilator when clinically stable.
8. Continue to monitor for signs of cardiac arrest and atrial fibrillation."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea prior
   to presentation. Nevertheless no evidence of hypoxia on initial
   presentation. Alternatively, the evidence of systolic failure and
   hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent ischemic event (but no q
   waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination of these two. Less likely
   tamponade, acidosis, PE.
   - needed pressor support overnight, with effective weaning.
   - cte ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - try to ween propofol to better assess brain/seizure activity and f/u
   neuro recs today
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin for AVR and
   PTT 60-90.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Overnight with decreased u/o.
   Most likely decreased forward flow in the setting of poor EF. No
   evidence of crackles on exam or LE edema, but exam is limited. If blood
   pressure normalizes then may try furosemide to improve forward flow and
   increase renal perfusion. Ionotropic support was briefly necessary.
   Alternative etiology is decreased volume but PCWP is elevated on ECHO.
   BUN/Cre is too high to suggest intrinsic renal cause such as ATN, but
   given his HypoTN this is a possibility.
   # Possible Cardiogenic shock: Has edema and uop now down to almost zero
   - BPs stable and appearts fluid overloaded on exam so will try lasix
   today to increase uop (bolus X 1) follow UOP today
   #
twitching
 movements noted with weaning sedation: concern for
   seizure, but no coordinated movements were noted. His neuro exam was
   unchanged, i.e. fixed/dialated pupils, no doll
s eye.  EEG was
   recording so it should provide clear information. Resolved with
   restarting of sedation. Propofol was chosen for its shorter
 life in
   case need to wean again.
   - F/u neurology recs and wean down propofol prior to their exam to
   allow them to assess seizures.
   # Anemia: HCT this am at 27 down from 31 on admission. VS stable. Will
   monitor, if continues to decrease may need scan for bleeding.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c
d as placed in the ED but
   will reassess for PIVs prior to d/c
ing.. Add PiVs for more access.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and recent cardiac arrest. He was found in asystolic cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. He has been in the ICU for several days, requiring pressor support, mechanical ventilation, and sedation. He has developed atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled, and has a coagulopathy likely due to warfarin and antibiotic use. He has acute kidney injury, which is suspected to be due to decreased forward flow in the setting of poor left ventricular function. He also has anemia, which is being monitored.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Complications:**
	* Cardiogenic shock due to poor left ventricular function and decreased forward flow.
	* Arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, which may progress to ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia.
	* Myocardial infarction or ischemia due to decreased coronary perfusion.
2. **Renal Complications:**
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to decreased forward flow and poor left ventricular function, which may progress to chronic kidney disease.
	* Fluid overload due to increased capillary permeability and decreased renal function.
3. **Neurological Complications:**
	* Seizures due to possible hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, or medication side effects.
	* Neurological damage due to prolonged hypoperfusion or hypoxia.
4. **Coagulation Complications:**
	* Bleeding due to coagulopathy and potential platelet dysfunction.
	* Thrombosis or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to decreased mobility and anticoagulation therapy.
5. **Infectious Complications:**
	* Sepsis or septic shock due to underlying infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
6. **Gastrointestinal Complications:**
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulceration or coagulopathy.
	* Nutritional deficiencies due to decreased oral intake and possible malabsorption.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including cardiac, renal, neurological, coagulation, infectious, and gastrointestinal complications. Close monitoring and management are essential to prevent or minimize these complications and improve the patient's outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - back on pressors
   - Full code per family
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam and ativan.
   - Continue EEG monitoring.
   # Afib: RVR overnight after levo started. Down titrated levo. Responded
   to metoprolol IV x1.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. Will monitor U/O in the
   setting of pressor support. Careful diuresis as needed.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Also very likely is hypoxic brain injury affecting the
   pituitary.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # Complicated UTI: Ceftriaxone x 10 days

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - back on pressors
   - Full code per family
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam and ativan.
   - Continue EEG monitoring.
   # Afib: RVR overnight after levo started. Down titrated levo. Responded
   to metoprolol IV x1.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. Will monitor U/O in the
   setting of pressor support. Careful diuresis as needed.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Also very likely is hypoxic brain injury affecting the
   pituitary.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # Complicated UTI: Ceftriaxone x 10 days

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

* The patient is an elderly man with DM2 and PAD who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest.
* He has been experiencing respiratory arrest, which led to cardiac arrest, and may also have had a recent ischemic event.
* He has been treated with pressors and has been intubated.
* He has had seizures, which are indicative of severe brain anoxia and are associated with poor outcomes.
* He has developed atrial fibrillation (AF) and has been treated with metoprolol.
* He has acute kidney injury (ARF) and is being monitored for urine output.
* He has a coagulopathy, which has been treated with FFP and vitamin K.
* He has anemia, which is being monitored.
* He has had hypoglycemia, which may be due to poor elimination of insulin, poor glucose metabolism, or hypoxic brain injury.
* He has a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) and has been treated with ceftriaxone.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is already compromised, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory failure.
* Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac status is already compromised, and further deterioration could lead to cardiac failure.
* Seizure activity: The patient has already had seizures, and further seizure activity could lead to poor outcomes.
* Infection: The patient has a complicated UTI, and further infection could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
* Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy could lead to bleeding complications.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia could lead to further compromise of his respiratory and cardiac status.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia could lead to further compromise of his neurological and cardiovascular status.
* ARF: The patient's ARF could lead to further compromise of his renal function and overall health.
* DVT: The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to his immobility and the presence of central lines.
* Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for developing stress ulcer due to his critical illness and the presence of central lines.
* VAP: The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to his intubation and the presence of central lines.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - back on pressors, on norepi today
   - Full code per family
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam and ativan.
   - Continue EEG monitoring.
   # Afib: RVR overnight after levo started. Down titrated levo. Responded
   to metoprolol IV x1.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. Will monitor U/O in the
   setting of pressor support. Careful diuresis as needed.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Also very likely is hypoxic brain injury affecting the
   pituitary.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # Complicated UTI: Ceftriaxone x 10 days

Based on the progress note, the patient is an elderly man with a history of DM2, PAD, and CHF who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He was intubated and started on pressors, including norepinephrine, to support his blood pressure. He also developed atrial fibrillation, which responded to metoprolol IV.

The patient's urine output trended down to 15 mL/hr after lasix, but improved with another dose of lasix. However, his blood pressure trended down into the 70s, and he was restarted on levophed to support his blood pressure.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a Hct of 24.7%. His WBC count is 11.5, and his platelet count is 253. His creatinine is 2.2 mg/dL, and his glucose is 76 mg/dL.

The patient's EEG showed generalized periodic epileptiform activity, indicating severe brain anoxia and associated with poor outcomes.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Asystolic cardiac arrest: likely related to respiratory arrest and CHF.
2. Seizure activity: generalized periodic epileptiform activity on EEG, indicating severe brain anoxia and poor outcomes.
3. Atrial fibrillation: responded to metoprolol IV.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): likely related to CHF and pressor support.
5. Coagulopathy: likely related to warfarin and antibiotic use, resolved with FFP/VitK.
6. Anemia: Hct stable, VS stable.
7. Hypoglycemia: unclear etiology, possibly related to poor elimination of insulin or poor GNG.
8. Complicated UTI: treated with ceftriaxone.
9. Respiratory failure: intubated and on ventilator support.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of cardiac function: continued pressor support may worsen cardiac function.
2. Increased risk of bleeding: coagulopathy and pressor support may increase the risk of bleeding.
3. Further respiratory compromise: continued respiratory failure may worsen respiratory function.
4. Increased risk of infection: complicated UTI and pressor support may increase the risk of infection.
5. Further neurologic compromise: continued seizure activity and hypoglycemia may worsen neurologic function.
6. Increased risk of kidney injury: continued ARF may worsen kidney function.
7. Further metabolic complications: hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may worsen metabolic function.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - back on pressors
   - Full code per family
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam and ativan.
   - Continue EEG monitoring.
   # Afib: RVR overnight after levo started. Down titrated levo. Responded
   to metoprolol IV x1.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. Will monitor U/O in the
   setting of pressor support. Careful diuresis as needed.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable at 26. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Also very likely is hypoxic brain injury affecting the
   pituitary.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: NPO
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c
d as placed in the ED but
   will reassess for PIVs prior to d/c
ing.. Add PiVs for more access.
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin ggt
   # CODE: Full. Had long discussion with daughters regarding [**Name2 (NI) **]
   prognosis. They are actively consulting their rabbi [**First Name (Titles) 1986**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6677**] of
   care. Family may not want to increase care but may not be comfortable
   withdrawing care.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of DM2, PAD, and CHF who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various interventions, including pressor support, antibiotics, and anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a Vt of 500 mL and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. His SpO2 is 96%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and his blood pressure is 110/44 mmHg. He is receiving pressor support with norepinephrine and has a heart rate of 102 bpm.
* Neurological status: The patient has been experiencing seizures, and an EEG has confirmed generalized periodic epileptiform activity. He is receiving anticonvulsant therapy with leviracetam and ativan.
* Renal status: The patient has acute kidney injury, and his creatinine level is 2.2 mg/dL. He is receiving diuretic therapy with furosemide.
* Hematological status: The patient has a coagulopathy, likely related to warfarin and antibiotic use. He has been treated with FFP and vitamin K.
* Endocrine status: The patient has DM2 and is receiving insulin sliding scale therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may require further interventions to improve his oxygenation and ventilation.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and he may require further adjustments to his pressor support therapy.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient's seizures may indicate severe brain anoxia, which can lead to poor outcomes.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to further complications.
* Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
* Infection: The patient's antibiotic therapy may not be adequate, leading to the development of a new infection.

The patient's family is actively involved in his care and has discussed his prognosis with his rabbi. They may not want to increase his care but may not be comfortable withdrawing care. The patient's code status is full code, and his family has expressed a desire for eventual tracheostomy and peg feeding if he is unable to be weaned off the ventilator within 7-10 days."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - BP continues to be stable w/o pressors
   - continue ventilation, decrease FiO2 as able
   - Will continue to attempt to diurese (-1Lt) however patient has had
   decreased UOP, but responded to lasix yesterday.
   - Multidisciplinary meeting
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam per Neurology and continue to wean off
   propophol.
   - Continue EEG.
   # Afib: paroxysmal in nature, remained rate controlled overnight. Not
   on any medications at this time.
   # ARF: Cr up to 2.1 from 1.0 in [**Month (only) 25**]. Most likely related to CHF.
   Urine output improved with furosemide. Will continue to diurese (-1Lt).
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable at 26. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Also possible is hypoxic brain injury affecting the
   pituitary.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # FEN: NPO overnight
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c
d as placed in the ED but
   will reassess for PIVs prior to d/c
ing.. Add PiVs for more access.
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin ggt
   # CODE: Full. Had long discussion with daughters regarding [**Name2 (NI) **]
   prognosis. They are actively consulting their rabbi [**First Name (Titles) 1986**] [**Last Name (Titles) 6677**] of
   care. Family may not want to increase care but may not be comfortable
   withdrawing care.

   24 Hour Events:
   - Family meeting. Family wants full code. If seems like futile can stop
   code. Wants eventual trach/peg if 7-10days from now can't be weaned off
   vent. Wants pressors if necessary.
   - A-line d/c'd because of dusky extremities
   - hypoglycemia to 50s-> 1amp D50 given
   - Neurology saw more seizures on EEG so started ativan 2mg Q4H
   - U/A positive so started CTX (h/o proteus and enterococcus in urine
   sensitive to CTX - not cipro)
   - UOP trended down to 15mL/hr after lasix in am wore off. Gave another
   40mg IV lasix with good urine output however, BPs then trended down
   into 70s. Gave 500mL then re-started levophed with pressures into 110s
   and HR 100.
   - On levophed patient developed rapid AF (HR 120s-140s) and BPs
   110s/50s. Gave 5mg IV lopressor and turned down levo as much as BP
   would tolerate.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - back on pressors, on norepi today
   - Full code per family
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam and ativan.
   - Continue EEG monitoring.
   # Afib: RVR overnight after levo started. Down titrated levo. Responded
   to metoprolol IV x1.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. Will monitor U/O in the
   setting of pressor support. Careful diuresis as needed.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Also very likely is hypoxic brain injury affecting the
   pituitary.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # Complicated UTI: Ceftriaxone x 10 days

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Family meeting. Family wants full code. If seems like futile can stop
   code. Wants eventual trach/peg if 7-10days from now can't be weaned off
   vent. Wants pressors if necessary.
   - A-line d/c'd because of dusky extremities
   - hypoglycemia to 50s-> 1amp D50 given
   - Neurology saw more seizures on EEG so started ativan 2mg Q4H
   - U/A positive so started CTX (h/o proteus and enterococcus in urine
   sensitive to CTX - not cipro)
   - UOP trended down to 15mL/hr after lasix in am wore off. Gave another
   40mg IV lasix with good urine output however, BPs then trended down
   into 70s. Gave 500mL then re-started levophed with pressures into 110s
   and HR 100.
   - On levophed patient developed rapid AF (HR 120s-140s) and BPs
   110s/50s. Gave 5mg IV lopressor and turned down levo as much as BP
   would tolerate.

   - back on pressors, on norepi today
   - Full code per family
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam and ativan.
   - Continue EEG monitoring.
   # Afib: RVR overnight after levo started. Down titrated levo. Responded
   to metoprolol IV x1.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. Will monitor U/O in the
   setting of pressor support. Careful diuresis as needed.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Also very likely is hypoxic brain injury affecting the
   pituitary.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and a history of cardiac arrest. He was admitted to the ICU with asystolic cardiac arrest and has been receiving pressor support. He has developed atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. He has also had seizures and is at risk for further neurological damage. His electrolyte levels are abnormal, and he has a coagulopathy. He has been treated with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and blood pressure medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and acute kidney injury may lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress or failure.
3. Neurological Complications: The patient's seizures and risk of further neurological damage may lead to permanent brain damage or death.
4. Coagulopathy Complications: The patient's coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications, such as hemorrhage or hematuria.
5. Infection Complications: The patient's complicated urinary tract infection may lead to sepsis or septic shock.
6. Hypoglycemia Complications: The patient's hypoglycemia may lead to further neurological damage or death if not treated promptly.
7. Anemia Complications: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to further complications, such as heart failure or respiratory distress.
8. Diabetic Complications: The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 may lead to further complications, such as ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment. The plan is to continue pressor support, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants. The patient's electrolyte levels will be closely monitored, and his coagulopathy will be managed with blood products and heparin. The patient's hypoglycemia will be treated with D50 infusions and D5 KVO. The patient's anemia will be monitored, and his diabetes mellitus type 2 will be managed with insulin sliding scale. The patient's complicated urinary tract infection will be treated with antibiotics, and his respiratory failure will be managed with mechanical ventilation. The patient's atrial fibrillation will be managed with anticoagulation therapy and rate control medications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Family meeting. Family wants full code. If seems like futile can stop
   code. Wants eventual trach/peg if 7-10days from now can't be weaned off
   vent. Wants pressors if necessary.
   - A-line d/c'd because of dusky extremities
   - hypoglycemia to 50s-> 1amp D50 given
   - Neurology saw more seizures on EEG so started ativan 2mg Q4H
   - U/A positive so started CTX (h/o proteus and enterococcus in urine
   sensitive to CTX - not cipro)
   - UOP trended down to 15mL/hr after lasix in am wore off. Gave another
   40mg IV lasix with good urine output however, BPs then trended down
   into 70s. Gave 500mL then re-started levophed with pressures into 110s
   and HR 100.
   - On levophed patient developed rapid AF (HR 120s-140s) and BPs
   110s/50s. Gave 5mg IV lopressor and turned down levo as much as BP
   would tolerate.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - back on pressors
   - Full code per family
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam and ativan.
   - Continue EEG monitoring.
   # Afib: RVR overnight after levo started. Down titrated levo. Responded
   to metoprolol IV x1.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. Will monitor U/O in the
   setting of pressor support. Careful diuresis as needed.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable at 26. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Also very likely is hypoxic brain injury affecting the
   pituitary.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # Complicated UTI: Ceftriaxone x 10 days
   # FEN: NPO
   # ACCESS: L femoral line, may need to be d/c
d as placed in the ED but
   will reassess for PIVs prior to d/c
ing.. Add PiVs for more access.
   # PROPHYLAXIS: heparin ggt
   # CODE: Full. Had long discussion with daughters regarding [**Name2 (NI) **]

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of DM2, PAD, and CHF who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He has been in the ICU for several days and has had multiple complications, including hypoglycemia, seizures, atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, and coagulopathy. He is currently on pressors, ventilator support, and IV fluids. His family has requested full code status and is considering tracheostomy and peg tube placement if he is unable to be weaned off the ventilator in 7-10 days.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is dependent on the ventilator. He may be at risk for further respiratory deterioration, including respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury, which may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
4. Neurological complications: The patient has had seizures and may be at risk for further neurological complications, such as stroke or brain death.
5. Infection: The patient has a complicated UTI, which may lead to sepsis or septic shock.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which may lead to bleeding complications.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient has had hypoglycemia and may be at risk for further episodes.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has CHF, which may lead to further cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
9. Metabolic complications: The patient has DM2, which may lead to further metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia or ketoacidosis.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications and requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these complications."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Most likely respiratory arrest.
   - Not requiring pressors
   - Full code per family, family meeting tomorrow or Monday
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   - Trach/Peg next week
   # Seizure activity: Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia
   and are associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe
   neurologic disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam.
   - Continue EEG monitoring.
   # Afib: rate less than 100 overnight.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. U/O improved with
   pressors. Cre mildly elevated vs admission.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Improving with TF
   - Will continue D50 infusions as needed.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # Complicated UTI: Ceftriaxone x 10 days

Summary:

The patient is a 90+ year old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral artery disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%. He has atrial fibrillation with a heart rate less than 100 beats per minute and is receiving heparin infusion. His laboratory results show anemia, coagulopathy, and acute kidney injury, but his creatinine levels are stable. He has a complicated urinary tract infection and is being treated with ceftriaxone for 10 days. His neurological status is unchanged, and he is being monitored for seizure activity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and his plateau pressure is 17 cmH2O, which may indicate respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a complicated urinary tract infection and is receiving antibiotics, which may increase his risk of sepsis.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels are stable, but his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are elevated, which may indicate acute kidney injury.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy likely caused by warfarin and antibiotic use, which may increase his risk of bleeding.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, which may indicate anemia and increase his risk of bleeding.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are low, which may indicate hypoglycemia and increase his risk of neurologic damage.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, which may indicate cardiovascular instability and increase his risk of cardiac arrest.
8. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is unchanged, and he is at risk of further deterioration due to his age and underlying medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 90+ year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral artery disease, and atrial fibrillation who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He was intubated and placed on pressors. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 101/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He has a history of seizure activity, atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, anemia, hypoglycemia, and complicated urinary tract infection. He is receiving various medications, including heparin, antibiotics, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is dependent on mechanical ventilation. Prolonged mechanical ventilation can lead to respiratory failure, and the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia is high.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of complicated urinary tract infection and is receiving antibiotics. Sepsis can occur due to the infection, and the patient's immune system may be compromised.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation and may be at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of seizure activity and may be at risk for further neurological complications such as brain herniation, cerebral edema, and seizures.
5. Bleeding Complications: The patient has a coagulopathy and is receiving anticoagulant therapy. Bleeding complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and hematuria are possible.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of complicated urinary tract infection and is at risk for further infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-associated bloodstream infection, and catheter-associated urinary tract infection.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient is receiving antibiotics and may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as Clostridioides difficile infection, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Endocrine Complications: The patient has diabetes mellitus type 2 and is at risk for endocrine complications such as hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and adrenal insufficiency.
9. Renal Complications: The patient has acute kidney injury and is at risk for further renal complications such as chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, and electrolyte imbalances.
10. Nutritional Complications: The patient is malnourished and may be at risk for nutritional complications such as protein-calorie malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired wound healing."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - back on pressors, on norepi today
   - Full code per family
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam and ativan.
   - Continue EEG monitoring.
   # Afib: RVR overnight after levo started. Down titrated levo. Responded
   to metoprolol IV x1.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. Will monitor U/O in the
   setting of pressor support. Careful diuresis as needed.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Also very likely is hypoxic brain injury affecting the
   pituitary.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # Complicated UTI: Ceftriaxone x 10 days

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Etiology includes respiratory arrest leading to
   cardiac arrest, especially since had been complaining of dyspnea and
   chocking sensation prior to presentation. Alternatively, the evidence
   of systolic failure and hypokinetic areas in LV may represent a recent
   ischemic event (but no q waves on ECG).  Most likely is a combination
   of respiratory arrest in setting of CHF.
   - back on pressors, on norepi today
   - Full code per family
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   # Seizure activity: EEG c/w generalized periodic epileptiform
   activity.  Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia and are
   associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic
   disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam and ativan.
   - Continue EEG monitoring.
   # Afib: RVR overnight after levo started. Down titrated levo. Responded
   to metoprolol IV x1.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. Will monitor U/O in the
   setting of pressor support. Careful diuresis as needed.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin ggt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.
   # Anemia: HCT stable. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Unclear etiology. Possibilities include poor
   elimination of insulin in the setting of ARF or poor GNG in the setting
   of arrest. Also very likely is hypoxic brain injury affecting the
   pituitary.
   - Will continue D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # Complicated UTI: Ceftriaxone x 10 days

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly man who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest, likely due to a combination of respiratory arrest and systolic failure. He has a history of DM2, PAD, and is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/43 mmHg. He is receiving pressors, including norepinephrine, and is being monitored for fluid balance and electrolyte levels.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Atrial fibrillation, which was treated with metoprolol and is being monitored.
2. Acute kidney injury, which is likely related to cardiac failure and is being managed with careful diuresis.
3. Coagulopathy, which was treated with FFP and VitK, and is now being managed with heparin.
4. Anemia, which is stable and being monitored.
5. Hypoglycemia, which is unclear in etiology and is being managed with D50 infusions and D5 KVO.
6. Complicated urinary tract infection, which is being treated with ceftriaxone.
7. Seizure activity, which is being managed with leviracetam and ativan, and is being monitored with EEG.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 267 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 58 mg/dL
* Calcium: 7.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.5 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.9 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing pressor support and monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results.
* Managing his cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
* Monitoring for and managing complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, and bleeding.
* Continuing his antibiotic therapy and monitoring for signs of infection.
* Managing his electrolyte levels and acid-base balance.
* Monitoring his neurological status and managing any further seizure activity.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Most likely respiratory arrest.
   - Not requiring pressors
   - Full code per family, family meeting today or Monday
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   - Trach/Peg next week
   # Seizure activity: Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia
   and are associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe
   neurologic disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam.
   - Continue EEG monitoring.
   # Afib: rate less than 100 overnight.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. U/O improved with
   pressors. Cre mildly elevated vs admission.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin gtt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.  Can likely discontinue heparin gtt today.
   # Anemia: HCT stable. VS stable. Will continue to monitor.
   # Hypoglycemia: Improving with TF

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of DM2, PAD, and asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently in the ICU, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has severe ulcers on his right foot, consistent with prior documentation by vascular surgery, and is at risk for infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2°F, heart rate of 85 bpm, and blood pressure of 124/50 mmHg. His respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute and an SpO2 of 100%. His cardiac status is complicated by atrial fibrillation, and he has a history of CHF.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 267 K/uL. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 25 mEq/L, and his creatinine is 2.8 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are normal, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's medical conditions include DM2, PAD, CHF, and atrial fibrillation. He has a history of seizures and is currently being treated with leviracetam. He also has a coagulopathy, which is likely related to warfarin and antibiotic use, and is being treated with heparin.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Infection: The patient has severe ulcers on his right foot, which are at risk for infection. He is also at risk for developing a complicated UTI.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases his risk of developing respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CHF and atrial fibrillation, which increases his risk of developing cardiac complications.
4. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and is currently being treated with leviracetam. He is at risk for developing further seizures.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which increases his risk of bleeding.
6. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, which increases his risk of developing further anemia.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of hypoglycemia, which increases his risk of developing further hypoglycemia.
8. DM2: The patient has a history of DM2, which increases his risk of developing further complications.

In conclusion, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a complex medical history and multiple medical conditions. He is at risk for developing various medical complications, including infection, respiratory failure, cardiac complications, seizures, coagulopathy, anemia, hypoglycemia, and DM2. He requires close monitoring and management of his medical conditions to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral artery disease, and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) following asystolic cardiac arrest. He has a severe anoxic brain injury, atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, and coagulopathy. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. His blood glucose levels are unstable, and he has a history of hypoglycemia. He is also receiving antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's complicated urinary tract infection and coagulopathy increase his risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increase his risk of developing respiratory failure, which could lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased risk of complications.
3. Neurological damage: The patient's severe anoxic brain injury and atrial fibrillation increase his risk of developing neurological damage, including seizures, stroke, and cognitive impairment.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of asystolic cardiac arrest increase his risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and history of anticoagulant use increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hemorrhagic shock and death.
6. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease increase his risk of developing renal failure, which could lead to end-stage renal disease and increased risk of complications.
7. Infection: The patient's complicated urinary tract infection and coagulopathy increase his risk of developing other infections, including pneumonia, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.

Overall, the patient is at high risk of developing multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Most likely respiratory arrest.
   - Not requiring pressors
   - Full code per family, family meeting Monday
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   - Trach/Peg next week
   # Seizure activity: Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia
   and are associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe
   neurologic disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam.
   - Neuro to d/c EEG monitoring today as poor prognosis
   # Afib: rate less than 100 overnight.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. U/O improved with
   pressors. Cre mildly elevated vs admission.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin gtt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.  Continue heparin drip for AVR.
   # Hypoglycemia: Improving with TF
   - Will continue D50 infusions as needed.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # Complicated UTI: Ceftriaxone x 10 days

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is an elderly man, aged over 90, with diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), peripheral artery disease (PAD), and a history of cardiac arrest. He is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's condition has remained stable, with no significant changes in vital signs or lab results. His blood pressure is still elevated, and his creatinine level is stable. His INR is therapeutic, and he is receiving heparin drip for anticoagulation.

The patient has severe ulcers on his right foot, which are consistent with prior documentation by vascular surgery. He also has a history of epilepsy, with ongoing epileptiform discharges on continuous EEG monitoring.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.25, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 25 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 107 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 267 K/uL. His liver enzymes are elevated, with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 47 IU/L and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 55 IU/L. His lactate level is 1.0 mmol/L.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Asystolic cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is likely related to respiratory arrest.
2. Seizure activity: The patient's seizure activity indicates severe brain anoxia and is associated with poor outcomes.
3. Atrial fibrillation (Afib): The patient's Afib is stable, with a rate less than 100 beats per minute.
4. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient's ARF is likely related to chronic heart failure (CHF).
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy is likely related to warfarin and antibiotic use.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia is improving with total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
7. Complicated urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a history of UTI, which is being treated with ceftriaxone.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further decline in cardiac function, leading to cardiac arrest or death.
2. Progression of ARF, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
3. Development of sepsis or septic shock, leading to multi-organ failure.
4. Recurrence of seizures, leading to further brain damage or death.
5. Development of respiratory failure, leading to mechanical ventilation or death.
6. Further decline in liver function, leading to liver failure or death.
7. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), leading to pulmonary hypertension or death.

Based on the patient's condition and medical complications, it is recommended that he continue to receive aggressive medical management, including mechanical ventilation, sedation, and antibiotics. The patient's family should be informed of his condition and the potential risks and benefits of further treatment. A family meeting should be scheduled to discuss the patient's long-term care options."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with multiple comorbidities. The patient's condition is complex, and several potential medical complications are noted.

The patient's severe ulcers on the right foot, consistent with prior documented tendons exposed, may lead to further complications such as infection, gangrene, or amputation.

The patient's epilepsy, with only some epileptiform discharges noted, and the poor prognosis, may lead to further seizures or status epilepticus.

The patient's atrial fibrillation, which is not well-controlled, may lead to further cardiac complications such as cardiac arrest.

The patient's hypoglycemia, which has been treated, may lead to further episodes of hypoglycemia if not properly managed.

The patient's impaired skin integrity, with severe ulcers on the right foot, may lead to further complications such as infection or gangrene.

The patient's altered mental status, with coma, may lead to further complications such as pressure ulcers, aspiration, or other respiratory complications.

The patient's respiratory support, with mechanical ventilation, may lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory results, including elevated lactate levels, may indicate tissue hypoperfusion or sepsis, which can lead to further complications such as organ failure or death.

The patient's medication regimen, including heparin, pantoprazole, and dextrose, may lead to further complications such as bleeding, acidosis, or hypoglycemia.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition and multiple comorbidities make them at high risk for further complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or mitigate these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Most likely respiratory arrest.
   - Not requiring pressors
   - Full code per family, family meeting Monday
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   - Trach/Peg next week
   # Seizure activity: Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia
   and are associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe
   neurologic disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam.
   - Neuro to d/c EEG monitoring today as poor prognosis
   # Afib: rate less than 100 overnight.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. U/O improved with
   pressors. Cre mildly elevated vs admission.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin gtt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.  Continue heparin drip for AVR.
   # Hypoglycemia: Improving with TF
   - Will continue D50 infusions as needed.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # Complicated UTI: Ceftriaxone x 10 days

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Most likely respiratory arrest.
   - Not requiring pressors
   - Full code per family, family meeting Monday
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   - Trach/Peg next week
   # Seizure activity: Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia
   and are associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe
   neurologic disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam.
   - Neuro to d/c EEG monitoring today as poor prognosis
   # Afib: rate less than 100 overnight.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. U/O improved with
   pressors. Cre mildly elevated vs admission.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin gtt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.  Continue heparin drip for AVR.
   # Hypoglycemia: Improving with TF
   - Will continue D50 infusions as needed.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale
   # Complicated UTI: Ceftriaxone x 10 days

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral artery disease, and a history of cardiac arrest. He is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2°F, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 124/50 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 100% on a FiO2 of 40%.

The patient has severe ulcers on his right foot, consistent with prior documentation by vascular surgery. His epilepsy neurologist reports that his epileptiform discharges are stable, but his prognosis remains poor.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 267 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 101 mg/dL
* Sodium: 140 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.1 mmol/L
* Chloride: 107 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.4 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Asystolic cardiac arrest
* Respiratory arrest
* Seizure activity
* Atrial fibrillation
* Acute kidney injury (likely related to congestive heart failure)
* Coagulopathy (likely related to warfarin and antibiotic use)
* Hypoglycemia
* Complicated urinary tract infection

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing Levitiracetam for seizure activity
* Discontinuing EEG monitoring due to poor prognosis
* Monitoring atrial fibrillation
* Continuing heparin drip for anticoagulation
* Managing hypoglycemia with D50 infusions as needed
* Holding PO hypoglycemics and using insulin sliding scale
* Completing 10 days of ceftriaxone for complicated urinary tract infection

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to complicated urinary tract infection
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to atrial fibrillation
* Respiratory failure due to respiratory arrest or acute kidney injury
* Neurological decline or death due to severe brain anoxia and poor prognosis
* Bleeding or hemorrhage due to coagulopathy
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to insulin sliding scale and PO hypoglycemics."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old man with DM2, PAD, who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest and was intubated. He is currently sedated and on mechanical ventilation. His neurological exam is limited by sedation, but the neurologist notes that the patient has some basic brainstem function, although he is still ventilator-dependent. The patient's family has been informed and has agreed to continue maximum treatment, including tracheostomy and peg tube placement.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is still ventilator-dependent. He may require continued mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the ventilator is discontinued.
2. Neurological complications: The patient has suffered a hypoxic brain injury, which is associated with poor outcomes. He may experience further neurological decline, including seizures, and may require continued anticonvulsant therapy.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient is on heparin therapy for anticoagulation, which increases the risk of bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Infection: The patient has a complicated UTI, which may require continued antibiotic therapy. There is also a risk of secondary infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is critical, and he may require continued cardiac monitoring and therapy to manage his arrhythmias.
6. Nutritional complications: The patient is at risk of malnutrition due to his critical illness and may require continued nutritional support.
7. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels are critical, and he may require continued insulin therapy to manage his hyperglycemia.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and he requires continued intensive care to manage his multiple medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral arterial disease, and a history of cardiac arrest. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The note highlights several key issues:

1. Hypoxic brain injury: The patient's EEG shows seizure activity, indicating severe brain anoxia, which is associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe neurologic disability).
2. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy likely caused by warfarin and antibiotic use, which has been resolved with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and vitamin K. The patient is currently receiving heparin drips for atrial fibrillation and to maintain a PTT of 60-90.
3. Complicated UTI: The patient has a complicated UTI, which was treated with ceftriaxone for 10 days, with the last dose administered on [**2108-3-4**].
4. Respiratory support: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
5. Cardiovascular status: The patient has atrial fibrillation, a systolic murmur, and a JVP of 8 cm.
6. Neurological status: The patient has a minimally responsive exam, with pupils that are reactive to pain, and no corneal reflex.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and systolic murmur suggest cardiac compromise, which could worsen with further cardiac decompensation.
3. Neurological decline: The patient's hypoxic brain injury and seizure activity on EEG indicate a high risk of neurological decline, which could lead to severe disability or death.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy could worsen, leading to bleeding complications or increased risk of thrombotic events.
5. Infection: The patient's complicated UTI could progress, leading to sepsis or other systemic infections.
6. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is critical, and further fluid shifts could lead to worsening respiratory or cardiac status.

Based on this assessment, it is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and neurological function. The patient's family should be kept informed of the patient's condition, and a family meeting should be scheduled to discuss the patient's code status and potential outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90+ year-old man with a history of DM2, PAD, who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently in the ICU and is being treated for various medical conditions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/40 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2. He is receiving heparin sodium infusion for atrial fibrillation and is being monitored for coagulopathy.

The patient's neurological status is grave, with minimal responsiveness to pain and pupils that are more reactive. His EEG is consistent with severe brain anoxia, and he has had seizure activity. His prognosis is poor, with a high risk of mortality or severe neurologic disability.

The patient is also being treated for acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 2.6 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L.

The patient has a complicated UTI, which is being treated with ceftriaxone. He is also being treated for hypoglycemia with dextrose infusions and is on an insulin sliding scale.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's complicated UTI and coagulopathy make him at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require increased ventilatory support.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of asystolic cardiac arrest and atrial fibrillation make him at risk for future cardiac arrests.
4. Neurological deterioration: The patient's poor neurological status and seizure activity make him at risk for further neurological deterioration.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to renal failure.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are slightly elevated, which may lead to further imbalances.
7. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of UTI make him at risk for developing further infections.

Overall, the patient's condition is grave, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is an elderly man who suffered an asystolic cardiac arrest, likely due to respiratory arrest. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. His blood pressure is 116/40 mmHg, and his heart rate is 85 beats per minute. He is receiving heparin infusion for anticoagulation and has a platelet count of 267 K/uL.

The patient's neurological exam is limited by sedation, but the neurologist notes that his exam is slightly improved compared to yesterday, with minimal responsiveness to pain and more reactive pupils. However, his EEG shows seizure activity, indicating severe brain anoxia, which is associated with poor outcomes.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated lactate levels, and elevated liver enzymes. His glucose levels have been fluctuating between 49 and 104 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may require further adjustments to his ventilator settings or consideration for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Sepsis: The patient has a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) and is at risk for developing sepsis, which could exacerbate his underlying condition.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving heparin infusion for anticoagulation, which increases his risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological exam is limited by sedation, and his EEG shows seizure activity, indicating severe brain anoxia. He may continue to deteriorate neurologically, which could impact his overall prognosis.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing further infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which could worsen his underlying condition.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with a grave prognosis, and his care requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Most likely respiratory arrest.
   - Not requiring pressors
   - Full code per family, family meeting Monday
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   - Trach/Peg next week
   # Seizure activity: Per Neurology these indicate severe brain anoxia
   and are associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe
   neurologic disability).
   - Will continue Levitiracetam.
   - Neuro to d/c EEG monitoring today as poor prognosis
   # Afib: rate less than 100 overnight.
   - continue to monitor
   # ARF: Cr stable. Most likely related to CHF. U/O improved with
   pressors. Cre mildly elevated vs admission.
   # Coagulopathy: Likely [**1-2**] combination of warfarin and antibiotic use.
   No evidence of DIC. Resolved with FFP/VitK. Now on heparin gtt for AVR
   and PTT 60-90.  Continue heparin drip for AVR.
   # Hypoglycemia: Improving with TF
   - Will continue D50 infusions as needed.
   # DM2: hold PO hypoglycemics
   - insulin sliding scale

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Called family to see if could come in for family meeting. They
   thought since nothing had changed they would not like to come in. Will
   consent over the phone for trach/peg
   - RN's wondering why we need heparin as no real consequence of a CVA at
   this point
   - Neuro came by - thought exam better than yesterday - minimally
   responsive to pain and pupils more reactive. EEG consistent with this.
   Prognosis still very grave. Will continue EEG monitoring, get repeat CT
   head.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2, peripheral artery disease, who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for various medical conditions. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 116/40 mmHg. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is being monitored. He also has acute kidney injury (AKI) and is receiving dialysis. His coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), but no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). He is receiving heparin therapy to prevent thrombosis.

The patient has a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being treated with ceftriaxone. He also has hypoglycemia and is being treated with insulin and dextrose infusions.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is high, and his oxygen saturation is 100%. He may be at risk for respiratory failure, especially if his underlying lung disease worsens.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest was likely related to respiratory arrest. He may be at risk for another cardiac arrest if his respiratory status deteriorates.
3. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and coagulopathy may be contributing to his septic state. He may be at risk for sepsis-related organ dysfunction.
4. Renal failure: The patient's AKI is likely related to his underlying medical conditions. He may be at risk for worsening renal failure if his blood pressure and cardiac output are not optimized.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's brain anoxia may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures, coma, or brain death. He may be at risk for these complications if his oxygenation and perfusion are not optimized.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's hypoglycemia may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. He may be at risk for these complications if his glucose levels are not well-controlled.
7. Infection: The patient's UTI may be a source of infection. He may be at risk for developing other infections, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections, if his immune system is compromised.
8. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications, such as epistaxis, hematuria, or gastrointestinal bleeding. He may be at risk for these complications if his coagulation profile is not well-controlled."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 90+ year old man with a history of DM2, PAD, who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has a trach/peg in place and is scheduled to have a PICC line inserted. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 130/54 mmHg. His respiratory status is being monitored, with a RSBI of 118 and a SpO2 of 97%.

Physical examination reveals a sedated and intubated patient with a II/VI systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border. His lungs are clear, with no wheeze or rales anteriorly. His abdomen is soft, and his extremities are without calf tenderness, femoral bruits, or skin lesions.

Laboratory results show a WBC count of 10.9 K/uL, Hct of 26.0%, and a platelet count of 267 K/uL. His electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L. His liver enzymes are mildly elevated, with an ALT of 47 and AST of 55. His troponin-T level is 0.07 ng/mL, indicating possible cardiac injury.

The patient has a complicated UTI, for which he is receiving ceftriaxone. He is also at risk for hypoxic brain injury due to his severe anoxia, and is being treated with levitiracetam to prevent seizures. He has a history of asystolic cardiac arrest, which is likely related to his respiratory arrest.

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to his prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a complicated UTI, which may lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
3. Hypoxic brain injury: The patient's severe anoxia may lead to permanent brain damage or death.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and hypoxic brain injury may lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Bloodstream infections: The patient's PICC line and trach/peg may increase his risk of developing bloodstream infections.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and sedation may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration pneumonia or gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly man who is intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently experiencing respiratory failure, acute, not ARDS. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 88 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 130/54 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.9 K/uL, a decreased hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.3 g/dL, and an elevated creatinine (Cr) level of 2.6 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 55 IU/L and an alkaline phosphatase (ALK) level of 98 IU/L.

The patient's respiratory support includes a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, with a tidal volume (Vt) set at 500 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 22 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 97%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a slight bilateral ronchi and no wheeze or rales anteriorly. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, and the patient has no signs of skin stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, acute, constipation, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's medications include antibiotics, and the patient has a PICC line inserted.

The patient's code status is full code, and the patient's disposition is pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further complications such as pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
2. Constipation: The patient's constipation can worsen, leading to complications such as bowel obstruction, bowel perforation, or fecal impaction.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can worsen, leading to complications such as stroke, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia can worsen, leading to complications such as seizures, coma, or even death.
5. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest can worsen, leading to complications such as cardiac shock, multi-organ failure, or even death.
6. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity can worsen, leading to complications such as skin breakdown, infection, or even sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral artery disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 130/54 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (2.6 mg/dL), potassium (4.3 mEq/L), and lactate (1.0 mmol/L), indicating possible kidney and liver dysfunction. His troponin-T level is elevated at 226 ng/mL, suggesting possible myocardial damage. His platelet count is low at 267 K/uL, and his international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated at 1.7, indicating possible bleeding risk.

The patient has a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being treated with ceftriaxone. He is also at risk for atrial fibrillation and has a history of seizure activity on EEG, indicating possible hypoxic brain injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of asystolic cardiac arrest and elevated troponin-T level suggest a possible cardiac cause for the arrest, and he may be at risk for another cardiac event.
3. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and possible liver dysfunction may indicate kidney injury, which can lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and elevated INR may indicate a risk for bleeding, which can be exacerbated by his history of atrial fibrillation.
5. Seizure activity: The patient's history of seizure activity on EEG suggests possible hypoxic brain injury, which can lead to further neurological decline.
6. Infection: The patient's complicated UTI and possible atrial fibrillation may increase his risk for infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiac, and neurological status to prevent further complications and improve his outcome."

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old man with DM2, PAD, and a history of asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 130/54 mmHg. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is receiving heparin for anticoagulation. His laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating possible cardiac injury. He has a complicated UTI and is receiving ceftriaxone for treatment.

The patient's neurological status is concerning, with seizure activity on EEG indicating severe brain anoxia and a high risk of poor outcome or severe neurologic disability. He is being treated with levetiracetam and will have his EEG reassessed today.

The patient's plan is to transition to vent rehabilitation this week and to have a tracheostomy and PEG tube placed today, either at the bedside or in the operating room. He will also have a PICC line placed by IR today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is already compromised, and there is a risk of further decline, especially if he develops respiratory acidosis or hypoxia.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is already compromised, and there is a risk of further cardiac injury or arrhythmias, especially if he develops respiratory acidosis or hypoxia.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is already compromised, and there is a risk of further decline, especially if he develops seizures or increased intracranial pressure.
4. Infection: The patient has a complicated UTI and is at risk of developing further infections, especially if his immune system is compromised.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving heparin and is at risk of bleeding complications, especially if his platelet count is low or if he develops thrombocytopenia.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, especially if he develops nausea, vomiting, or constipation.
7. Nutritional complications: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and there is a risk of malnutrition or dehydration if he does not receive adequate nutrition and hydration."

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral artery disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 130/54 mmHg. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is receiving anticoagulation therapy. His respiratory support includes a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O. He has a tracheostomy planned for today and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line to be placed by interventional radiology.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is closely monitored due to his history of atrial fibrillation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but he has a history of atrial fibrillation and is receiving anticoagulation therapy.
3. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of hypoxic brain injury and seizure activity on EEG, which indicates severe brain anoxia and poor outcomes.
4. Infection: The patient has a complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) and is receiving ceftriaxone for 10 days.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy and has a history of atrial fibrillation, which increases his risk of bleeding complications.
6. Nutritional complications: The patient's nutrition is being managed through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to his tracheostomy.
7. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels are being closely monitored due to his history of diabetes mellitus type 2.
8. Line-related complications: The patient has multiple lines in place, including a multi-lumen catheter and a PICC line, which increases his risk of line-related complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is an elderly man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral artery disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 130/54 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 97%.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently receiving heparin therapy for atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation for ventricular arrhythmia. He has a complicated urinary tract infection and is receiving ceftriaxone for 10 days. His laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, anemia, and elevated lactate levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals a sedated and intubated patient with a slightly bilateral ronchi on lung examination. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, and his extremities are without any palpable pulses.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Asystolic cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is likely related to respiratory arrest, and he is not requiring pressors. He is receiving full code resuscitation and has a tracheostomy and peg tube planned.
2. Hypoxic brain injury: The patient has severe brain anoxia and is at risk of poor outcomes, including mortality or severe neurologic disability. He is receiving anticonvulsant therapy and will have his EEG reassessed today.
3. Complicated urinary tract infection: The patient is receiving ceftriaxone for 10 days and has a history of UTI.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is receiving heparin therapy for atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation for ventricular arrhythmia.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Tracheostomy and peg tube placement: The patient will have a tracheostomy and peg tube placed today, either at the bedside or in the operating room.
2. PICC line placement: The patient will have a PICC line placed today by the interventional radiology department.
3. Transition to vent rehab: The patient will be transitioned to vent rehab this week.
4. Neurological evaluation: The patient will have his neurological status reassessed today.
5. Anticonvulsant therapy: The patient will continue to receive anticonvulsant therapy for his seizure activity.
6. Antibiotic therapy: The patient will continue to receive ceftriaxone for 10 days for his complicated urinary tract infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of DM2, PAD, and a recent asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and peg feeding tube in place.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 135/51 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on a FiO2 of 40%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a sedated and intubated individual with a II/VI systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border. His lung exam shows slight bilateral rhonchi, and his abdomen is soft with no masses or tenderness.

Laboratory results show:

* WBC: 10.9 K/uL
* Hct: 26.0%
* Plt: 267 K/uL
* Cr: 2.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 85 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.8/28.7/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 226/13/0.07, ALT/AST: 47/55, Alk Phos/T Bili: 98/0.3, Lactic Acid: 1.0 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.6 g/dL, LDH: 359 IU/L, Ca++: 7.6 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.7 mg/dL, PO4: 4.1 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Asystolic arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is likely related to respiratory arrest, and he is not requiring pressors. He is full code per family.
* Hypoxic brain injury: The patient has severe brain anoxia, and his seizure activity on EEG indicates a poor outcome (>90% mortality or severe neurologic disability).
* Anticoagulation and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis: The patient is receiving heparin drip for anticoagulation and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis.
* Complicated urinary tract infection: The patient is receiving ceftriaxone for 10 days.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is already compromised, and he may require continued mechanical ventilation.
* Neurological deficits: The patient's hypoxic brain injury may result in severe neurological deficits or death.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as bleeding or cardiac arrhythmias.
* Infection: The patient's complicated urinary tract infection and prolonged hospitalization may increase his risk of developing additional infections.
* Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's peg feeding tube may not be providing adequate nutrition, and he may require further evaluation and management of his nutritional status.
* Skin breakdown: The patient's prolonged immobility and compromised circulation may increase his risk of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral artery disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 135/51 mmHg. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on heparin and coumadin for anticoagulation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (2.8 mg/dL) and potassium (4.3 mEq/L), as well as an elevated lactate level (1.0 mmol/L). His white blood cell count is 10.9 K/uL, and his platelet count is 267 K/uL.

The patient's medical history includes a complicated urinary tract infection, which was treated with ceftriaxone. He also has a history of hypoxic brain injury, which is associated with poor outcomes.

Potential medical complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation increase his risk of developing VAP.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying respiratory disease and hypoxic brain injury may increase his risk of respiratory failure.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of asystolic cardiac arrest may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
4. Infection: The patient's history of complicated urinary tract infection and prolonged hospitalization increase his risk of developing other infections, such as sepsis or pneumonia.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat or drink may lead to nutritional deficiencies, such as malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient's prolonged immobility and poor circulation may increase his risk of developing pressure ulcers.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and prolonged hospitalization increase his risk of developing DVT.
8. Seizures: The patient's history of hypoxic brain injury and seizure activity on EEG may increase his risk of developing seizures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral artery disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is intubated with a tracheostomy tube. He has a history of complicated urinary tract infection and is being treated with ceftriaxone. His blood glucose levels have been low, and he is being monitored closely for hypoglycemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 135/51 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation. His respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, ventilator mode, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, platelets, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). His electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's physical examination is stable, with no signs of respiratory distress or cardiac tamponade. His skin is warm and dry, with no signs of stasis dermatitis or ulcers.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk of developing respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and hypoxic brain injury increase his risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock.
3. Infection: The patient's complicated urinary tract infection and prolonged ICU stay increase his risk of developing secondary infections.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's hypoxic brain injury and seizure activity on EEG indicate severe brain anoxia and are associated with poor outcomes.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and use of antacids and proton pump inhibitors increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding and constipation.
6. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's risk of developing venous thromboembolism is increased due to his prolonged immobility and use of heparin.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient's prolonged immobility and use of pressure-reducing devices increase his risk of developing pressure ulcers.
8. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection: The patient's use of urinary catheters increases his risk of developing catheter-associated urinary tract infection.

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination closely to identify any potential medical complications early and intervene promptly to prevent adverse outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a [**Age over 90 **] yo man with DM2, PAD presents with asystolic cardiac
   arrest.
   # Asystolic arrest:  Most likely respiratory arrest.
   - Not requiring pressors
   - Full code per family
   - AC with no spontaneous BR despite being off sedation.
   - failed risbi
   - Trach/Peg today possible at bedside otherwise in OR
   - PICC line to be placed by IR today
   - transition to vent rehab this week
   # Hypoxic brain injury: Despite slightly improved exam over last few
   days, per Neurology seizure activity on EEG indicates severe brain
   anoxia and are associated with poor outcomes (>90% mortality or severe
   neurologic disability)
   - Appreciate neuro recs
   - Cont  Levitiracetam
   - Neuro to reassess today.
   -Consider d/c EEG
   # AVR: Now on heparin gtt for AVR and PTT 60-90.  Continue heparin drip
   for AVRafter trach/peg placed. Holding coumadin for Trach/peg. Will
   need hep bridge for INR less than 2.5.
   # Complicated UTI: Ceftriaxone x 10 days
 last dose [**2108-3-11**]

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral artery disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently intubated and sedated, with a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placed today. He is also receiving antibiotics for a complicated urinary tract infection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 81 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 135/51 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on a tracheostomy tube with a FiO2 of 40%.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a II/VI systolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, and slight bilateral rhonchi on lung examination. His abdomen is soft, and his extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 267 K/uL. His creatinine is 2.8 mg/dL, and his glucose is 85 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Asystolic arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is likely due to respiratory arrest, and he is not requiring pressors. He has a full code status, and his family has been informed.
2. Hypoxic brain injury: The patient has a severe brain anoxia, as indicated by seizure activity on EEG, which is associated with a poor outcome (>90% mortality or severe neurologic disability).
3. Anticoagulation: The patient is receiving heparin for atrial fibrillation, and his partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is 60-90 seconds. He is holding coumadin until his tracheostomy and PEG are placed, and he will require a heparin bridge for an INR less than 2.5.
4. Complicated UTI: The patient is receiving ceftriaxone for 10 days for a complicated urinary tract infection.
5. ICU care: The patient's nutrition is being managed with total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and his glycemic control is being monitored. He has a multi-lumen central venous catheter and a PICC line, which may need to be replaced by interventional radiology (IR) today.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may require continued mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a complicated urinary tract infection, which may lead to sepsis.
3. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase his risk of bleeding.
4. Neurological deficits: The patient's severe brain anoxia may lead to long-term neurological deficits.
5. Infection: The patient has a tracheostomy and PEG, which may increase his risk of infection.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as bleeding or stroke."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a complex medical history. Recent events include percutaneous tracheostomy and PEG insertion. The patient is currently on ventilator support, with a tracheostomy tube and is receiving fentanyl and vecuronium infusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 135/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has atrial fibrillation and is at risk for cardiac arrest.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and they are dependent on mechanical ventilation. Weaning from the ventilator may be challenging, and the risk of respiratory failure is high.
2. Seizure activity: The patient has a history of seizures, and the use of Keppra may not be sufficient to control them. The risk of seizure activity is high, especially during the weaning process.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are fluctuating, and the risk of hypoglycemia is high. Close monitoring of glucose levels is necessary to prevent hypoglycemic episodes.
4. Constipation: The patient is at risk for constipation due to their medication regimen and decreased mobility. This may lead to impaction and further complications.
5. Skin integrity: The patient is at risk for impaired skin integrity due to their prolonged stay in the ICU. This may lead to pressure ulcers and other skin complications.
6. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is critical, and the risk of cardiac arrest is high. Close monitoring of cardiac rhythm and function is necessary to prevent cardiac arrest.
7. Anoxic brain damage: The patient has a history of anoxic brain damage, and the risk of further brain damage is high. Close monitoring of neurological status is necessary to detect any changes.
8. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to their prolonged immobility. Prophylactic measures should be implemented to prevent DVT.
9. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to their prolonged stay in the ICU. Close monitoring of respiratory status and implementation of VAP prevention measures are necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Heart rate: 82 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 117/46 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on heparin sodium infusion for anticoagulation. He has a central venous catheter (CVC) and a peripheral intravenous catheter (PICC) in place. The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 12.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 325 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 10.9 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 28 mEq/L
* Creatinine: 2.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 172 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 139 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, and chloride 106 mEq/L

The patient has a complicated UTI and is being treated with ceftriaxone for 10 days. He has a history of hypoxic brain injury and is currently being managed with leviracetam and is awaiting further neurology recommendations.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if the ventilation settings are not optimal or if there is a respiratory infection.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias if the anticoagulation therapy is not optimal.
* Bleeding: The patient is on heparin sodium infusion, and there is a risk of bleeding if the anticoagulation therapy is not optimal.
* Infection: The patient has a complicated UTI, and there is a risk of developing other infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
* Neurological complications: The patient has a history of hypoxic brain injury, and there is a risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and there is a risk of further bleeding if the anticoagulation therapy is not optimal.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and peripheral artery disease who presented with asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for atrial fibrillation, complicated urinary tract infection, and hypoxic brain injury.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 117/46 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 99%. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.9 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 26.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 325 x 10^9/L. His blood glucose level is 172 mg/dL, and his creatinine level is 2.8 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, complicated urinary tract infection, and hypoxic brain injury. He is receiving treatment for these conditions, including antibiotics for the urinary tract infection and heparin for atrial fibrillation. He is also receiving mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place.

The patient's potential medical complications include respiratory failure, sepsis, and bleeding due to his atrial fibrillation and complicated urinary tract infection. He is at risk for further neurological damage due to his hypoxic brain injury, and may require ongoing treatment and rehabilitation to manage his condition.

In conclusion, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a complex medical condition who is being treated in the ICU for atrial fibrillation, complicated urinary tract infection, and hypoxic brain injury. He is at risk for various medical complications and will require ongoing monitoring and treatment to manage his condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of DM2, PAD, and asystolic cardiac arrest. He is currently in the ICU with a tracheostomy tube and a peg tube. He has been on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 99%. His heart rate is 82 beats per minute, and his blood pressure is 117/46 mmHg. He has a central venous line (CVL) and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. He has been receiving heparin infusions for anticoagulation and has a platelet count of 325,000/uL.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 10.9
* Hct: 26.0
* Plt: 325,000/uL
* Cr: 2.8
* Glucose: 172 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.8/86.9/1.4, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 226/13/0.07, ALT/AST: 47/55, Alk Phos/T Bili: 98/0.3, Lactic Acid: 1.0 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.6 g/dL, LDH: 359 IU/L, Ca++: 7.6 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.7 mg/dL, PO4: 4.1 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and he is on mechanical ventilation. He may require further respiratory support or consideration for extubation.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is 117/46 mmHg, and he has a history of asystolic cardiac arrest. He may require further cardiovascular support or consideration for cardiology consultation.
3. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of hypoxic brain injury and seizure activity on EEG. He may require further neurological consultation or consideration for rehabilitation.
4. Infection: The patient has a complicated UTI and may require further antibiotic therapy or consideration for infectious disease consultation.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient is on heparin infusions for anticoagulation and has a platelet count of 325,000/uL. He may require further bleeding risk assessment or consideration for platelet transfusion.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving enteral nutrition, but his laboratory results show a low albumin level. He may require further nutritional support or consideration for parenteral nutrition.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and may require further gastrointestinal support or consideration for gastroenterology consultation.
8. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. He may require further electrolyte management or consideration for endocrinology consultation.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."
