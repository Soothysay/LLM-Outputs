You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, HTN, and sCHF, experienced a VF arrest and was resuscitated. She is currently intubated and sedated, with a rhythm of sinus. The patient has a history of AFib, tachy-brady syndrome, and pacemaker placement. She is on multiple medications, including ASA, Plavix, and statin, and is receiving IV fluids and dopamine. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and acute on chronic kidney disease.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, and VF arrest, there is a risk of further cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, or cardiac rupture.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, pneumothorax, or respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications: The patient's acute on chronic kidney disease and history of GI bleeding increase the risk of renal complications, including acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease progression, or electrolyte imbalances.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's history of tachy-brady syndrome and pacemaker placement increase the risk of neurological complications, including stroke, seizures, or cognitive impairment.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and dirty urine culture increase the risk of infection, including UTI, sepsis, or other infections.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's history of GI bleeding and use of anticoagulants increase the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, or other bleeding events.
7. Fluid overload: The patient's IV fluids and dopamine therapy increase the risk of fluid overload, which can lead to cardiac failure, pulmonary edema, or other complications.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of GI bleeding and use of anticoagulants increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.

It is essential to monitor the patient closely and adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64.6 kg, 62-inch individual who suffered a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and is currently being treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 113/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The patient is receiving dopamine and fentanyl infusions for hemodynamic support and pain management, respectively. The patient's cardiac rhythm is a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Prolonged ICU stay: The patient's prolonged cardiac arrest and subsequent ICU stay increase the risk of complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, and prolonged immobility.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's mechanical ventilation and PEEP may increase the risk of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's first-degree AV block and prolonged cardiac arrest increase the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, and cardiogenic shock.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's prolonged cardiac arrest and subsequent hypoperfusion may increase the risk of neurological complications such as stroke, seizures, and cognitive impairment.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and lack of oral intake increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as aspiration, nausea, and vomiting.
6. Infection: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines and devices increase the risk of infection, particularly central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI).
7. Delirium: The patient's prolonged ICU stay, sedation, and pain management may increase the risk of delirium, which can worsen outcomes and prolong recovery.
8. Family and caregiver burden: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and critical illness may place a significant burden on family and caregivers, potentially affecting their mental and emotional well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, patient is currently re-warming. TTE
   performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of the
   LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium.
   - Complete Artic sun protocol
   - Wean sedation as tolerates
   - CT head w/o contrast today per Neurology recs
   - EP will see today, likely ICD placement on this admission
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off dopamine
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, now improved with gentle IVF
s & on
   Dopamine.
   - Infectious work up as below
   - IVF
   - Wean pressors as tolerated with target MAP >60
   .
   #. Leukocytosis
 Stable at 17.3 today from 18.0 on [**2131-12-29**]. Pt w/
   grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload, diarrhea at rehab
   though none here.  Cardiac arrest itself could also cause leukocytosis.
   - F/U Ucx
   - F/U BC
   - Levofloxacin given CXR and UA for 5 days
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic kidney disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5,
   admitted with Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone and dirty U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal
   etiology. Received gentle IVF
s on [**2131-12-29**] with good UOP. U/A grossly
   positive, receiving Levofloxacin, day 2. Cr improved to 2.5 this AM.
   - Hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   - Continue Levaquin 500mg IV q24H, day [**2-1**]
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2.
   - B12 & Folate pending
   - Can consider transfusion if mixed central venous O2 is low
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, patient is currently re-warming. TTE
   performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of the
   LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium.
   - Complete Artic sun protocol
   - Wean sedation as tolerates
   - CT head w/o contrast today per Neurology recs
   - EP will see today, likely ICD placement on this admission
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off dopamine
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, now improved with gentle IVF
s & on
   Dopamine.
   - Infectious work up as below
   - IVF
   - Wean pressors as tolerated with target MAP >60
   .
   #. Leukocytosis
 Stable at 17.3 today from 18.0 on [**2131-12-29**]. Pt w/
   grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload, diarrhea at rehab
   though none here.  Cardiac arrest itself could also cause leukocytosis.
   - F/U Ucx
   - F/U BC
   - Levofloxacin given CXR and UA for 5 days
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic kidney disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5,
   admitted with Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone and dirty U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal
   etiology. Received gentle IVF
s on [**2131-12-29**] with good UOP. U/A grossly
   positive, receiving Levofloxacin, day 2. Cr improved to 2.5 this AM.
   - Hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   - Continue Levaquin 500mg IV q24H, day [**2-1**]
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2.
   - B12 & Folate pending
   - Can consider transfusion if mixed central venous O2 is low
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications.

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU and identify potential medical complications that can arise.

**Summary:**

The patient is a 76-year-old woman who had a ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest secondary to ischemia after a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She was resuscitated and intubated. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25-30%. She is currently in the ICU receiving mechanical ventilation and sedation.

**Physical Examination:**

The patient is intubated and has no spontaneous movement. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 113/47 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her lungs are clear to auscultation, and her abdomen is soft and non-distended.

**Laboratory Results:**

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated troponin T levels (0.08-0.11 ng/mL) indicating cardiac damage
* Elevated creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB levels, suggesting myocardial damage
* Elevated lactic acid level (1.6 mmol/L), indicating metabolic acidosis
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels, indicating kidney dysfunction
* Anemia with a normocytic normochromic anemia and high RDW
* Elevated ferritin level (1249 ng/mL) and low iron level (30 μg/dL), indicating iron deficiency

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, and VF arrest increase her risk of developing cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
2. **Kidney Dysfunction:** The patient's elevated BUN and Cr levels indicate kidney dysfunction, which can worsen if not managed properly.
3. **Infection:** The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and positive urine culture (UA) suggest a possible infection, which needs to be treated promptly.
4. **Iron Deficiency:** The patient's low iron level and elevated ferritin level indicate iron deficiency, which can worsen anemia and increase the risk of bleeding.
5. **Hypotension:** The patient's hypotension, which is likely secondary to her cardiac condition and mechanical ventilation, needs to be managed carefully to prevent further complications.
6. **Pneumonia:** The patient's mechanical ventilation and sedation increase her risk of developing pneumonia, which needs to be monitored closely.
7. **Sepsis:** The patient's elevated WBC and positive UA suggest a possible sepsis, which needs to be treated promptly and aggressively.

**Plan:**

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing mechanical ventilation and sedation
* Monitoring her cardiac rhythm and function closely
* Managing her blood pressure and kidney function
* Treating her infection and iron deficiency
* Weaning her from pressors and sedation as tolerated
* Considering ICD placement
* Monitoring for signs of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock and arrhythmias
* Continuing to manage her anemia and iron deficiency
* Monitoring for signs of infection, such as pneumonia and sepsis"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, patient is currently re-warming. TTE

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, and CHF who experienced a VF arrest. She is currently in the ICU and is being treated with mechanical ventilation, sedation, and dopamine to maintain blood pressure. Her cardiac enzymes are elevated, and her echocardiogram shows an EF of 15-20% with akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Further cardiac arrhythmias or arrest
	* Development of heart failure or cardiogenic shock
	* Myocardial infarction or stunned myocardium
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia
	* Respiratory failure or respiratory acidosis
	* Pneumothorax or hemothorax
3. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury or worsening chronic kidney disease
	* Fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances
	* Urinary tract infections or sepsis
4. Hematological Complications:
	* Anemia or bleeding due to platelet dysfunction
	* Leukocytosis or neutropenia
	* Thrombocytopenia or disseminated intravascular coagulation
5. Infection Complications:
	* Sepsis or septic shock
	* Urinary tract infections or pneumonia
	* Central line-associated bloodstream infections
6. Neurological Complications:
	* Stroke or transient ischemic attack
	* Seizures or status epilepticus
	* Neurological deficits or cognitive impairment
7. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
	* Pancreatitis or cholecystitis
	* Diarrhea or constipation

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, patient is currently re-warming. TTE
   performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of the
   LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium.
   - Complete Artic sun protocol
   - Wean sedation as tolerates
   - CT head w/o contrast today per Neurology recs
   - ICD this admission
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, and s/p CABG x 4. She had a VF/VT arrest and was resuscitated. She is currently in the ICU with mechanical ventilation, sedation, and pressors. Her cardiac enzymes are elevated, and an echocardiogram shows an EF of 15-20% with akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere. She has a history of heart failure with an EF of 25-30% prior to this admission.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Prolonged hypotension and pressor dependence
	* Risk of cardiac arrhythmias and VF/VT arrest
	* Potential for cardiac failure and cardiogenic shock
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Prolonged mechanical ventilation and risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia
	* Risk of respiratory failure and need for non-invasive ventilation
3. Neurological Complications:
	* Risk of seizures and stroke due to cardiac arrest and hypotension
	* Potential for neurological deficits and cognitive impairment
4. Renal Complications:
	* Risk of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease progression
	* Potential for electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances
5. Infectious Complications:
	* Risk of sepsis and septic shock due to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or other sources
	* Potential for secondary infections such as pneumonia, UTI, or central line-associated bloodstream infection
6. Hematological Complications:
	* Risk of bleeding due to platelet dysfunction and coagulopathy
	* Potential for anemia and bleeding secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding or other causes
7. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation
	* Potential for diarrhea and electrolyte imbalances
8. Metabolic Complications:
	* Risk of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia due to insulin resistance and medication
	* Potential for electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances
9. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Risk of cardiac arrhythmias and VF/VT arrest
	* Potential for cardiac failure and cardiogenic shock

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and she is at risk for cardiac complications. She requires close monitoring and management of her cardiac status. The plan is to complete the Arctic Sun protocol, wean sedation as tolerated, and resume beta-blockers once BP allows and pressors are weaned. She also requires management of her respiratory, neurological, renal, and gastrointestinal status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Continued hypotension due to stunned myocardium and potential for further cardiac compromise.
	* Risk of arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, due to the patient's history of VF arrest and ongoing cardiac instability.
	* Potential for further cardiac damage or infarction due to ongoing ischemia.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Risk of respiratory failure due to ongoing mechanical ventilation and potential for further respiratory compromise.
	* Potential for pneumonitis or pneumonia due to the patient's history of cardiac arrest and potential for aspiration.
3. Renal complications:
	* Risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension, fluid overload, and potential for further nephrotoxicity from medications.
	* Potential for chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression due to ongoing hypertension and potential for further kidney damage.
4. Hematological complications:
	* Risk of anemia progression due to ongoing bleeding, bone marrow suppression, or iron deficiency.
	* Potential for thrombocytopenia or leukopenia due to ongoing sepsis, medication toxicity, or bone marrow suppression.
5. Infectious complications:
	* Risk of sepsis or septic shock due to ongoing bacterial or fungal infection.
	* Potential for pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or other infections due to ongoing immunosuppression and potential for further bacterial or fungal colonization.
6. Neurological complications:
	* Risk of further neurological damage or infarction due to ongoing cardiac instability, hypotension, or potential for further cerebral edema.
	* Potential for cognitive impairment, seizures, or other neurological symptoms due to ongoing brain injury or potential for further cerebral edema.

Given the patient's complex medical history and ongoing instability, it is essential to closely monitor her condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # . New Acute Renal failure after recent Acute on Chronic kidney
   disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with Cr of 3.3 in
   context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and spironolactone and dirty
   U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology; creatinine improved
   to 2.4 with hydration. Was placed on levaquin ([**2131-12-31**] would be day 3).
   On [**2131-12-30**], continued to worsen with zero urine-output by early [**2131-12-31**]
   despite boluses. Also had worsening metabolic acisosis. Discovered to
   have c.diff on [**2131-12-31**].
   The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - Fluid Challenge with 2L given dry lungs
   - restart Dopa at 2 for renal vasodilation, assess utility over day
   - d/c levaquin, start PO vanc with IV flagyl for ARF as complication of
   C.diff
   - d/c'd Dopamine and started Norepi to avoid renal vasoconstriction
   - d/d
d allopurinol in ARF
   - urine lytes, ua, cx, eos ordered if increase in urine output
   - renal consult in AM
   - still holding spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # C. Diff infection: likely related to levaquin, although patient had
   diarrhea at rehab. Unknown if received abx. Can cause markedly elevated
   WBC's (WBC 34.3 and 22% Bands); Can cause renal failure.
   Theoretically, she had this infection prior to admission, was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming
   - start PO vanc, can increase to 500 mg q6
   - start 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - serial q8 abdominal exams
   - start Tigecycline if no response; consider also cholestyramine
   - placed on precautions
   .
   #. Leukocytosis with new bandemia
 Was Stable at 17.3 [**2131-12-30**] from 18.0
   on [**2131-12-29**]; Pt had grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload,
   and diarrhea at rehab and none until [**2130-12-30**] here. On [**2131-12-31**], the WBC
   was 34.3 and 22% Bands. current though is related to C Diff. Also worry
   about aspiration pneumonia (3 days s/p arrest) but CXR looks reassuring
   - F/U Ucx x 2
   - F/U BC from [**12-30**] and [**12-31**]
   - F/u CXR final read taken at 1/4 AM
   - continue PO Vanc, IV flagyl; can increase vanc dose, start
   tigecycline or cholestyramine if difficulty in managment.
   - wean pressor with goal map > 60
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12 noon.
   TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of
   the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium. Patient required pressor support with
   dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming. The pressor was
   switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2130-12-30**]. CT head, per protocol, was
   unrevealing on [**2130-12-30**] [**1-29**] EEG lead artifact. EP saw patient, will place
   ICD when stable.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RISBI and Breathing trials
   - discuss with neurology whether must repeat CT; would have to be after
   EEG
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: At 3.4; related to low cardiac output and pressors.
   Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   -          follow
   -          improve fluid status and reseasess plan
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, but could also be related to sepsis. On
   0.04 Norepi
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29
   - follow daily
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications on extubation
   .
   # Gout
 patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.
   - holding allopurinol in ARF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # . New Acute Renal failure after recent Acute on Chronic kidney
   disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with Cr of 3.3 in
   context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and spironolactone and dirty
   U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology; creatinine improved
   to 2.4 with hydration. Was placed on levaquin ([**2131-12-31**] would be day 3).
   On [**2131-12-30**], continued to worsen with zero urine-output by early [**2131-12-31**]
   despite boluses. Also had worsening metabolic acisosis. Discovered to
   have c.diff on [**2131-12-31**].
   The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - Fluid Challenge with 2L given dry lungs
   - restart Dopa at 2 for renal vasodilation, assess utility over day
   - d/c levaquin, start PO vanc with IV flagyl for ARF as complication of
   C.diff
   - d/c'd Dopamine and started Norepi to avoid renal vasoconstriction
   - d/d
d allopurinol in ARF
   - urine lytes, ua, cx, eos ordered if increase in urine output
   - renal consult in AM
   - still holding spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # C. Diff infection: likely related to levaquin, although patient had
   diarrhea at rehab. Unknown if received abx. Can cause markedly elevated
   WBC's (WBC 34.3 and 22% Bands); Can cause renal failure.
   Theoretically, she had this infection prior to admission, was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming
   - start PO vanc, can increase to 500 mg q6
   - start 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - serial q8 abdominal exams
   - start Tigecycline if no response; consider also cholestyramine
   - placed on precautions
   .
   #. Leukocytosis with new bandemia
 Was Stable at 17.3 [**2131-12-30**] from 18.0
   on [**2131-12-29**]; Pt had grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload,
   and diarrhea at rehab and none until [**2130-12-30**] here. On [**2131-12-31**], the WBC
   was 34.3 and 22% Bands. current though is related to C Diff. Also worry
   about aspiration pneumonia (3 days s/p arrest) but CXR looks reassuring
   - F/U Ucx x 2
   - F/U BC from [**12-30**] and [**12-31**]
   - F/u CXR final read taken at 1/4 AM
   - continue PO Vanc, IV flagyl; can increase vanc dose, start
   tigecycline or cholestyramine if difficulty in managment.
   - wean pressor with goal map > 60
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12 noon.
   TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of
   the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium. Patient required pressor support with
   dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming. The pressor was
   switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2130-12-30**]. CT head, per protocol, was
   unrevealing on [**2130-12-30**] [**1-29**] EEG lead artifact. EP saw patient, will place
   ICD when stable.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RISBI and Breathing trials
   - discuss with neurology whether must repeat CT; would have to be after
   EEG
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: At 3.4; related to low cardiac output and pressors.
   Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   -          follow
   -          improve fluid status and reseasess plan
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, but could also be related to sepsis. On
   0.04 Norepi
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29
   - follow daily
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications on extubation
   .
   # Gout
 patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, HTN, and sCHF. She had a VT arrest, and was admitted with acute renal failure (ARF) and sepsis. She has been treated with antibiotics, fluids, and pressors, but her condition has worsened, with a decrease in urine output, worsening metabolic acidosis, and a diagnosis of complicated C. diff infection. She has also developed leukocytosis with new bandemia, lactic acidosis, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. C. diff infection: The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest a severe C. diff infection, which can lead to further complications such as septic shock, organ failure, and death.
2. Renal failure: The patient's ARF is likely to worsen without adequate treatment, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and an increased risk of cardiovascular events.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to worsen without adequate treatment, leading to further complications such as organ failure, shock, and death.
4. Lactic acidosis: The patient's lactic acidosis is likely to worsen without adequate treatment, leading to further complications such as organ failure and death.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely to worsen without adequate treatment, leading to further complications such as organ failure, shock, and death.
6. Leukocytosis with new bandemia: The patient's leukocytosis with new bandemia is likely to worsen without adequate treatment, leading to further complications such as septic shock, organ failure, and death.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely to worsen without adequate treatment, leading to further complications such as organ failure and death.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is likely to worsen without adequate treatment, leading to further complications such as cardiovascular events and death.
9. Mitral regurgitation: The patient's mitral regurgitation is likely to worsen without adequate treatment, leading to further complications such as heart failure and death.
10. Gout: The patient's gout is likely to worsen without adequate treatment, leading to further complications such as joint damage and disability."

   # . New Acute Renal failure after recent Acute on Chronic kidney
   disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with Cr of 3.3 in
   context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and spironolactone and dirty
   U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology; creatinine improved
   to 2.4 with hydration. Was placed on levaquin ([**2131-12-31**] would be day 3).
   On [**2131-12-30**], continued to worsen with zero urine-output by early [**2131-12-31**]
   despite boluses. Also had worsening metabolic acisosis. Discovered to
   have c.diff on [**2131-12-31**].
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - continue bicarb
   - could be component of intravascular dryness (hct 29 from 24 after one
   unit). Discuss fluid management
   - d/c levaquin, start PO vanc with IV flagyl for ARF as complication of
   C.diff
   - d/c'd Dopamine and started Norepi to avoid renal vasoconstriction
   - d/d
d allopurinol in ARF
   - urine lytes, ua, cx, eos ordered if increase in urine output
   - renal consult in AM
   - still holding spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # C. Diff infection: likely related to levaquin, although patient had
   diarrhea at rehab. Unknown if received abx. Can cause markedly elevated
   WBC's (WBC 34.3 and 22% Bands); Can cause renal failure.
   - start PO vanc, can increase to 500 mg q6
   - start 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - start Tigecycline if no response; consider also cholestyramine
   - placed on precautions
   .
   #. Leukocytosis with new bandemia
 Was Stable at 17.3 [**2131-12-30**] from 18.0
   on [**2131-12-29**]; Pt had grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload,
   and diarrhea at rehab and none until [**2130-12-30**] here. On [**2131-12-31**], the WBC
   was 34.3 and 22% Bands. current though is related to C Diff. Also worry
   about aspiration pneumonia (3 days s/p arrest) but CXR looks reassuring
   - F/U Ucx x 2
   - F/U BC from [**12-30**] and [**12-31**]
   - F/u CXR final read taken at 1/4 AM
   - continue PO Vanc, IV flagyl; can increase vanc dose, start
   tigecycline or cholestyramine if difficulty in managment.
   - wean pressor with goal map > 60
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12 noon.
   TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of
   the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium. Patient required pressor support with
   dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming. The pressor was
   switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2130-12-30**]. CT head, per protocol, was
   unrevealing on [**2130-12-30**] [**1-29**] EEG lead artifact. EP saw patient, will place
   ICD when stable.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RISBI and Breathing trials
   - discuss with neurology whether must repeat CT; would have to be after
   EEG
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, but could also be related to sepsis. On
   0.04 Norepi
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, recent NSTEMI, HTN, and sCHF. She had a VF/VT arrest and was resuscitated. She was admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, c-diff infection, and sepsis. She has been receiving pressor support with dopamine and norepinephrine, and has been treated with antibiotics and antifungals. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and creatinine levels.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and creatinine levels suggest that she may be developing sepsis. This is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting that she may be experiencing acute kidney injury. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and other complications.
3. C-diff infection: The patient has a c-diff infection, which can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and other symptoms. This infection can also lead to sepsis and death if left untreated.
4. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent VF/VT arrest and respiratory failure increase her risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. This is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment.
5. Heart failure: The patient's history of CAD and recent NSTEMI increase her risk of developing heart failure. This can lead to pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, and other complications.
6. Hypertension: The patient's recent VF/VT arrest and pressor support increase her risk of developing hypertension. This can lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiogenic shock and stroke.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be contributing to her fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. This condition requires prompt recognition and treatment to prevent complications.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be contributing to her hypoxia and hypercapnia. This condition requires prompt recognition and treatment to prevent complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely.
2. Adjust her antibiotic and antifungal therapy as needed based on her laboratory results and clinical response.
3. Consider adding a second antibiotic or antifungal agent if the patient's infection does not improve with current therapy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # . New Acute Renal failure after recent Acute on Chronic kidney
   disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with Cr of 3.3 in
   context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and spironolactone and dirty
   U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology; creatinine improved
   to 2.4 with hydration. Was placed on levaquin ([**2131-12-31**] would be day 3).
   On [**2131-12-30**], continued to worsen with zero urine-output by early [**2131-12-31**]
   despite boluses. Also had worsening metabolic acisosis. Discovered to
   have c.diff on [**2131-12-31**].
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - continue bicarb
   - could be component of intravascular dryness (hct 29 from 24 after one
   unit). Discuss fluid management
   - d/c levaquin, start PO vanc with IV flagyl for ARF as complication of
   C.diff
   - d/c'd Dopamine and started Norepi to avoid renal vasoconstriction
   - d/d
d allopurinol in ARF
   - urine lytes, ua, cx, eos ordered if increase in urine output
   - renal consult in AM
   - still holding spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # C. Diff infection: likely related to levaquin, although patient had
   diarrhea at rehab. Unknown if received abx. Can cause markedly elevated
   WBC's (WBC 34.3 and 22% Bands); Can cause renal failure.
   - start PO vanc, can increase to 500 mg q6
   - start 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - start Tigecycline if no response; consider also cholestyramine
   - placed on precautions
   .
   #. Leukocytosis with new bandemia
 Was Stable at 17.3 [**2131-12-30**] from 18.0
   on [**2131-12-29**]; Pt had grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload,
   and diarrhea at rehab and none until [**2130-12-30**] here. On [**2131-12-31**], the WBC
   was 34.3 and 22% Bands. current though is related to C Diff. Also worry
   about aspiration pneumonia (3 days s/p arrest) but CXR looks reassuring
   - F/U Ucx x 2
   - F/U BC from [**12-30**] and [**12-31**]
   - F/u CXR final read taken at 1/4 AM
   - continue PO Vanc, IV flagyl; can increase vanc dose, start
   tigecycline or cholestyramine if difficulty in managment.
   - wean pressor with goal map > 60
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12 noon.
   TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of
   the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium. Patient required pressor support with
   dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming. The pressor was
   switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2130-12-30**]. CT head, per protocol, was
   unrevealing on [**2130-12-30**] [**1-29**] EEG lead artifact. EP saw patient, will place
   ICD when stable.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RISBI and Breathing trials
   - discuss with neurology whether must repeat CT; would have to be after
   EEG
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, but could also be related to sepsis. On
   0.04 Norepi
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29
   - follow daily
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications on extubation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # . New Acute Renal failure after recent Acute on Chronic kidney
   disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with Cr of 3.3 in
   context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and spironolactone and dirty
   U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology; creatinine improved
   to 2.4 with hydration. Was placed on levaquin ([**2131-12-31**] would be day 3).
   On [**2131-12-30**], continued to worsen with zero urine-output by early [**2131-12-31**]
   despite boluses. Also had worsening metabolic acisosis. Discovered to
   have c.diff on [**2131-12-31**].
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - continue bicarb
   - could be component of intravascular dryness (hct 29 from 24 after one
   unit). Discuss fluid management
   - d/c levaquin, start PO vanc with IV flagyl for ARF as complication of
   C.diff
   - d/c'd Dopamine and started Norepi to avoid renal vasoconstriction
   - d/d
d allopurinol in ARF
   - urine lytes, ua, cx, eos ordered if increase in urine output
   - renal consult in AM
   - still holding spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # C. Diff infection: likely related to levaquin, although patient had
   diarrhea at rehab. Unknown if received abx. Can cause markedly elevated
   WBC's (WBC 34.3 and 22% Bands); Can cause renal failure.
   - start PO vanc, can increase to 500 mg q6
   - start 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - start Tigecycline if no response; consider also cholestyramine
   - placed on precautions
   .
   #. Leukocytosis with new bandemia
 Was Stable at 17.3 [**2131-12-30**] from 18.0
   on [**2131-12-29**]; Pt had grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload,
   and diarrhea at rehab and none until [**2130-12-30**] here. On [**2131-12-31**], the WBC
   was 34.3 and 22% Bands. current though is related to C Diff. Also worry
   about aspiration pneumonia (3 days s/p arrest) but CXR looks reassuring
   - F/U Ucx x 2
   - F/U BC from [**12-30**] and [**12-31**]
   - F/u CXR final read taken at 1/4 AM
   - continue PO Vanc, IV flagyl; can increase vanc dose, start
   tigecycline or cholestyramine if difficulty in managment.
   - wean pressor with goal map > 60
   .
   #. VF/VT Arrest - No strips, but AED fired twice, so most likely VF/VT
   arrest secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**]. 18 hour Artic sun
   protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12 noon.
   TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with akinesis of
   the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere, though the
   inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on [**11-4**], likely
   representing stunned myocardium. Patient required pressor support with
   dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming. The pressor was
   switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2130-12-30**]. CT head, per protocol, was
   unrevealing on [**2130-12-30**] [**1-29**] EEG lead artifact. EP saw patient, will place
   ICD when stable.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RISBI and Breathing trials
   - discuss with neurology whether must repeat CT; would have to be after
   EEG
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   .
   #. Hypotension - most likely in the setting of starting mechanical
   ventilation and with sedation, but could also be related to sepsis. On
   0.04 Norepi
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Rhythm - See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   #. Pump - Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   .
   #. Coronaries - Pt with troponin T
s of 0.08 to 0.11 yesterday,
   secondary to arrrest. No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and
   negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80
   - Continue ASA
   - Continue Plavix
   .
   #. Anemia -Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29
   - follow daily
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt s/p arrest now requiring pressors.
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   .
   #. Mitral regurgitation
 Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared
   to prior.
   .
   #. Asthma - No wheezes or signs of exacerbation. Will continue home
   medications on extubation

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, CABG, NSTEMI, HTN, and sCHF, who suffered a VT arrest. She was admitted with acute renal failure (ARF) and sepsis. Her initial creatinine was 3.3, which improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, her urine output decreased to zero, and she developed metabolic acidosis. She was found to have C. diff infection, which is likely related to levaquin. The patient is currently receiving treatment for C. diff, including PO vanc and IV flagyl.

The patient is also experiencing leukocytosis with new bandemia, likely related to C. diff. She has a history of diarrhea at rehab and had grossly positive UA, CXR with mild fluid overload, and none until admission here. Her current WBC count is 34.3 with 22% bands.

The patient has a history of VF/VT arrest, likely secondary to ischemia after NSTEMI. She required pressor support with dopamine, which increased with warming. The pressor was switched to Norepi on [**2130-12-30**].

The patient has a history of anemia, normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Her ferritin level is 1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, and iron 30. She has been transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with response to 29.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to the C. diff infection, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Renal failure: The patient's ARF may worsen due to the C. diff infection, which can cause further damage to the kidneys.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to the C. diff infection, which can cause further inflammation and edema in the lungs.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of VT arrest and NSTEMI puts her at risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's C. diff infection may cause further gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nausea.
6. Hematological complications: The patient's anemia and leukocytosis may worsen due to the C. diff infection, which can cause further bone marrow suppression and blood cell dysfunction.
7. Infection-related complications: The patient is at risk of developing infection-related complications, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections, due to her compromised immune system and presence of central lines and catheters."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # . New Acute Renal failure after recent Acute on Chronic kidney
   disease - Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with Cr of 3.3 in
   context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and spironolactone and dirty
   U/A. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology; creatinine improved
   to 2.4 with hydration. Was placed on levaquin ([**2131-12-31**] would be day 3).
   On [**2131-12-30**], continued to worsen with zero urine-output by early [**2131-12-31**]
   despite boluses. Also had worsening metabolic acisosis. Discovered to
   have c.diff on [**2131-12-31**].
   The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.
   PLAN FOR [**2130-12-31**]
   - Fluid Challenge with 2L given dry lungs
   - restart Dopa at 2 for renal vasodilation, assess utility over day
   - d/c levaquin, start PO vanc with IV flagyl for ARF as complication of
   C.diff
   - d/c'd Dopamine and started Norepi to avoid renal vasoconstriction
   - d/d
d allopurinol in ARF
   - urine lytes, ua, cx, eos ordered if increase in urine output
   - renal consult in AM
   - still holding spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # C. Diff infection: likely related to levaquin, although patient had
   diarrhea at rehab. Unknown if received abx. Can cause markedly elevated
   WBC's (WBC 34.3 and 22% Bands); Can cause renal failure.
   Theoretically, she had this infection prior to admission, was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming
   - start PO vanc, can increase to 500 mg q6
   - start 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - serial q8 abdominal exams
   - start Tigecycline if no response; consider also cholestyramine
   - placed on precautions

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI, HTN, and sCHF. She was admitted with VT arrest and has been in the ICU for several days.

The patient has developed acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 3.3 mg/dL and is requiring dialysis. She has also developed c-diff infection, which is likely related to the levaquin she received. The patient has a high white blood cell count (34.3) with 22% bands, which is concerning for sepsis.

The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15-20% and akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis elsewhere. She has required pressor support with dopamine and norepinephrine and has been on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has also developed lactic acidosis, with a level of 3.4 mmol/L, which is likely related to her low cardiac output and pressors. Her feet are hypoperfused bilaterally.

The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm (NSR) with left bundle branch block (LBBB), but she has had a history of VT arrest and is at risk for recurrent arrhythmias.

The patient's anemia is normocytic normochromic with a high RDW, suggesting iron deficiency. She has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and is requiring ongoing transfusions.

The patient's hypertension is being managed with pressors, and her mitral regurgitation is stable per TTE.

The patient's medications include PO vanc and IV flagyl for c-diff, d/c levaquin, and d/c allopurinol in ARF.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's high white blood cell count and 22% bands are concerning for sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level of 3.3 mg/dL and requirement for dialysis suggest AKI, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of VT arrest and current rhythm of NSR with LBBB make her at risk for recurrent arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
4. Lactic acidosis: The patient's lactic acid level of 3.4 mmol/L is concerning, as it can lead to metabolic acidosis and multi-organ failure.
5. Hypoperfusion: The patient's hypoperfused feet and low cardiac output make her at risk for further hypoperfusion, which can lead to tissue necrosis and organ failure.
6. Iron deficiency: The patient's anemia and low reticulocyte count suggest iron deficiency, which can lead to further anemia and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing pressor support with norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure.
2. Weaning sedation and RISBI and breathing trials to assess neurological status.
3. Restarting beta-blockers once blood pressure allows and pressors are weaned.
4. Continuing PO vanc and IV flagyl for c-diff.
5. Holding allopurinol in ARF.
6. Following daily reticulocyte count to assess response to transfusions.
7. Monitoring for signs of sepsis and AKI.
8. Assessing cardiac status and rhythm regularly.
9. Monitoring for signs of lactic acidosis and hypoperfusion.
10. Considering ICD placement when stable."

   24 Hour Events:
   - neuro thinks pt is doing poorly from neuro status stand point
   - anuric, given 2L NS followed by another 1L NS, low dose dopamine
   started while levophed was weaned off, with hope to increase renal
   perfusion, but HR went to 120s-130s, dopamine discontinued, neo
   started, HR better, BP in the 100s, but UOP still close to zero
   - renal recs: muddy brown casts present, consistent with ATN, likely HD
   tonight or tomorrow morning
   - DP pulses not dopplerable, femoral pulses weak but palpable
   - ABG acidotic, continued on bicarb gtt
   - KUB ordered for more abdominal distention, consistent with early
   toxic megacolon
   - PO vanc increased from 125mg to 500mg Q6h, PR vanc started
   - OGT put on low wall suction
   - repeat KUB showed some improvement
   - surgery consulted, no surgery for now, pending neuro status
   - at about 11:40pm, pt was noted to have anisocoria, right pupil
   (4mm)minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm, concerning for
   herniation
   - vent setting changed to promote hyperventilation, HOB elevated at 30
   degree, mannitol considered but decided against it given renal failure,
   hypotension, acidosis
   - repeat head CT with EEG leads on showed that right sided brain is
   completely edematous, significantly different from one day prior
   - neurosurg contact[**Name (NI) **] but they wanted to have neuro see her first
   - in the morning around 5am, pupils were checked again, equal, 2.5mm
   mimimal-to-no reactivity to light
   - family said that patient would not want to live if neurological
   function is poor, ""not want to live as vegetable""
   - still full code, but husband will fly in tomorrow pm from [**State 1771**], a
   family meeting was proposed for 4pm tomorrow, it would be good to have
   neuro for the meeting

   KUB [**1-1**] (my read): transverse colon distension slightly improved
   compared to the prior KUB, stomach decompressed, tip of OGT in
   appropriate location
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient was found down in rehab, unclear how
   long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on arctic sun
   cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
   AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in
   the presence of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation
   completely wears off before final neuro status and neurologic prognosis
   determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], patient was noted to have anisocoria
   (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm reactive
   to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head with EEG leads on
   showed that right-sided brain is completely edematous with no obvious
   midline shift.  Pupils are equal at 2.5mm this morning, with
   minimal-to-no reactivity to light.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - f/u on final head CT read
   - get repeat CT head when EEG leads are off
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin for CVA prevention
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - if poor neurologic prognosis, need to reconsider code status
   (currently full)
   - family meeting this pm after husband flies from [**State 1771**] to see her, it
   would be useful to have neuro present during the meeting
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but needs to have neuro status
   assessment prior to any surgical planning.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl, PR vanc 250mg
   QID
   - serial KUBs to eval toxic megacolon, look for free air and evidence
   of perforation
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - f/u surgery recs
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.
   - f/u renal recs
   - will initiate HD today pending neuron status
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - aggressive NS bolus
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips, but was shocked by AED twice.  Most likely
   etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia, ischemia
   after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18 hour Artic
   sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12
   noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RSBI and Breathing trials
   - f/u neuro recs
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   - if pt recovers neurologically, she would be a candidate for ICD
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta 0.27).  Anion gap acidosis is likely
   from lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - continue aggressive volume resuscitation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT (18), PTT (89.8) an INR (1.6).  In the
   setting of sepsis, concerning for DIC.  Could also be due to liver
   injury, however LFT is not terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary
   to starvation and vitK deficiency.
   - f/u fibrinogen
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will need FFP if actively bleeding
   - will give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - aggressively fluid resuscitate pt given c.diff colitis
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - if patient recovers, she will need a ICD
   - if BP improves, will restart BB
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct downtrended on [**1-1**] to 25.5, secondary to
   hemodilution from IVF boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.
   - continue albuterol nebs prn
   .
   # Gout: patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.
   - holding allopurinol in ARF

   24 Hour Events:
   - neuro thinks pt is doing poorly from neuro status stand point
   - anuric, given 2L NS followed by another 1L NS, low dose dopamine
   started while levophed was weaned off, with hope to increase renal
   perfusion, but HR went to 120s-130s, dopamine discontinued, neo

   KUB [**1-1**] (my read): transverse colon distension slightly improved
   compared to the prior KUB, stomach decompressed, tip of OGT in
   appropriate location
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient was found down in rehab, unclear how
   long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on arctic sun
   cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
   AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in
   the presence of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation
   completely wears off before final neuro status and neurologic prognosis
   determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], patient was noted to have anisocoria
   (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm reactive
   to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head with EEG leads on
   showed that right-sided brain is completely edematous with no obvious
   midline shift.  Pupils are equal at 2.5mm this morning, with
   minimal-to-no reactivity to light.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - f/u on final head CT read
   - get repeat CT head when EEG leads are off
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin for CVA prevention
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - if poor neurologic prognosis, need to reconsider code status
   (currently full)
   - family meeting this pm after husband flies from [**State 1771**] to see her, it
   would be useful to have neuro present during the meeting
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but needs to have neuro status
   assessment prior to any surgical planning.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl, PR vanc 250mg
   QID
   - serial KUBs to eval toxic megacolon, look for free air and evidence
   of perforation
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - f/u surgery recs
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.
   - f/u renal recs
   - will initiate HD today pending neuron status
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - aggressive NS bolus
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips, but was shocked by AED twice.  Most likely
   etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia, ischemia
   after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18 hour Artic
   sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12
   noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RSBI and Breathing trials
   - f/u neuro recs
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   - if pt recovers neurologically, she would be a candidate for ICD
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta 0.27).  Anion gap acidosis is likely
   from lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - continue aggressive volume resuscitation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT (18), PTT (89.8) an INR (1.6).  In the
   setting of sepsis, concerning for DIC.  Could also be due to liver
   injury, however LFT is not terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary
   to starvation and vitK deficiency.
   - f/u fibrinogen
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will need FFP if actively bleeding
   - will give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - aggressively fluid resuscitate pt given c.diff colitis
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - if patient recovers, she will need a ICD
   - if BP improves, will restart BB
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct downtrended on [**1-1**] to 25.5, secondary to
   hemodilution from IVF boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.
   - continue albuterol nebs prn
   .
   # Gout: patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.
   - holding allopurinol in ARF

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   CT shows a stroke, neuro indicates that [**Doctor Last Name **] stem reflexes are poor.
   Her prognosis is very poor. Husband has arrived from [**State 1771**]. Will
   discuss prognosis and treatment options.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, NSTEMI, HTN, and sCHF. She was admitted with VF/VT arrest and has been in the ICU for several days. The patient's condition is critical, and the following potential medical complications are noted:

1. Anoxic brain injury: The patient has been in a coma since admission, and her brain CT scan shows significant edema. Her pupils are unequal and minimally reactive to light, indicating a poor neurologic prognosis.
2. C. Difficile colitis: The patient has a history of diarrhea and has been treated with antibiotics. Her KUB shows evidence of early toxic megacolon, and she meets the surgical indication for colectomy.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine has increased to 3.3, and she has muddy brown casts in her urine, consistent with ATN. She is at risk for further renal damage and may require hemodialysis.
4. Septic shock: The patient has been treated with pressors and has a high lactate level, indicating ongoing sepsis. She is at risk for further organ failure.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's PT, PTT, and INR are elevated, indicating a coagulopathy. This may be due to sepsis, liver injury, or starvation.
6. Liver dysfunction: The patient's LFTs are abnormal, indicating liver dysfunction. This may be due to hepatic congestion or shock liver.
7. Leukocytosis with bandemia: The patient has a high WBC count and bandemia, indicating an inflammatory response. This may be secondary to c. diff or UTI.
8. Lactic acidosis: The patient has a high lactate level, indicating lactic acidosis. This may be due to low cardiac output and pressors.
9. Rhythm: The patient's rhythm is currently normal sinus rhythm with LBBB, but she has a history of NSTEMI and may be at risk for further cardiac complications.
10. Anemia: The patient has a normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW, indicating iron deficiency. She has been transfused with one unit of PRBC and may require further transfusions.

The patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and aggressive management to address these potential complications. The patient's family has been informed of her poor neurologic prognosis and has requested a family meeting to discuss treatment options."

   24 Hour Events:
   - neuro thinks pt is doing poorly from neuro status stand point
   - anuric, given 2L NS followed by another 1L NS, low dose dopamine
   started while levophed was weaned off, with hope to increase renal
   perfusion, but HR went to 120s-130s, dopamine discontinued, neo
   started, HR better, BP in the 100s, but UOP still close to zero
   - renal recs: muddy brown casts present, consistent with ATN, likely HD
   tonight or tomorrow morning

   CT head [**1-1**] (my read): right hemisphere significantly edematous, no
   midline shift. Significantly different from CT head from [**12-30**]
   KUB [**1-1**] (my read): transverse colon distension slightly improved
   compared to the prior KUB, stomach decompressed, tip of OGT in
   appropriate location
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient was found down in rehab, unclear how
   long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on arctic sun
   cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
   AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in
   the presence of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation
   completely wears off before final neuro status and neurologic prognosis
   determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], patient was noted to have anisocoria
   (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm reactive
   to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head with EEG leads on
   showed that right-sided brain is completely edematous with no obvious
   midline shift.  Pupils are equal at 2.5mm this morning, with
   minimal-to-no reactivity to light.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - f/u on final head CT read
   - get repeat CT head when EEG leads are off
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin for CVA prevention
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - if poor neurologic prognosis, need to reconsider code status
   (currently full)
   - family meeting this pm after husband flies from [**State 1771**] to see her, it
   would be useful to have neuro present during the meeting
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but needs to have neuro status
   assessment prior to any surgical planning.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl, PR vanc 250mg
   QID
   - serial KUBs to eval toxic megacolon, look for free air and evidence
   of perforation
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - f/u surgery recs
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.
   - f/u renal recs
   - will initiate HD today pending neuron status
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - aggressive NS bolus
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips, but was shocked by AED twice.  Most likely
   etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia, ischemia
   after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18 hour Artic
   sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12
   noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RSBI and Breathing trials
   - f/u neuro recs
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   - if pt recovers neurologically, she would be a candidate for ICD
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta 0.27).  Anion gap acidosis is likely
   from lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - continue aggressive volume resuscitation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT (18), PTT (89.8) an INR (1.6).  In the
   setting of sepsis, concerning for DIC.  Could also be due to liver
   injury, however LFT is not terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary
   to starvation and vitK deficiency.
   - f/u fibrinogen
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will need FFP if actively bleeding
   - will give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - aggressively fluid resuscitate pt given c.diff colitis
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - if patient recovers, she will need a ICD
   - if BP improves, will restart BB
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct downtrended on [**1-1**] to 25.5, secondary to
   hemodilution from IVF boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.
   - continue albuterol nebs prn
   .
   # Gout: patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.
   - holding allopurinol in ARF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   compared to the prior KUB, stomach decompressed, tip of OGT in
   appropriate location
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient was found down in rehab, unclear how
   long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on arctic sun
   cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
   AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in
   the presence of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation
   completely wears off before final neuro status and neurologic prognosis
   determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], patient was noted to have anisocoria
   (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm reactive
   to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head with EEG leads on
   showed that right-sided brain is completely edematous with no obvious
   midline shift.  Pupils are equal at 2.5mm this morning, with
   minimal-to-no reactivity to light.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - f/u on final head CT read
   - get repeat CT head when EEG leads are off
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin for CVA prevention
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - if poor neurologic prognosis, need to reconsider code status
   (currently full)
   - family meeting this pm after husband flies from [**State 1771**] to see her, it
   would be useful to have neuro present during the meeting
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but needs to have neuro status
   assessment prior to any surgical planning.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl, PR vanc 250mg
   QID
   - serial KUBs to eval toxic megacolon, look for free air and evidence
   of perforation
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - f/u surgery recs
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.
   - f/u renal recs
   - will initiate HD today pending neuron status
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - aggressive NS bolus
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips, but was shocked by AED twice.  Most likely
   etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia, ischemia
   after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18 hour Artic
   sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12
   noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RSBI and Breathing trials
   - f/u neuro recs
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   - if pt recovers neurologically, she would be a candidate for ICD
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta 0.27).  Anion gap acidosis is likely
   from lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - continue aggressive volume resuscitation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT (18), PTT (89.8) an INR (1.6).  In the
   setting of sepsis, concerning for DIC.  Could also be due to liver
   injury, however LFT is not terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary
   to starvation and vitK deficiency.
   - f/u fibrinogen
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will need FFP if actively bleeding
   - will give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - aggressively fluid resuscitate pt given c.diff colitis
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - if patient recovers, she will need a ICD
   - if BP improves, will restart BB
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct downtrended on [**1-1**] to 25.5, secondary to
   hemodilution from IVF boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.
   - continue albuterol nebs prn
   .
   # Gout: patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.

Summary:

The patient, a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, NSTEMI, HTN, and CHF, was admitted to the ICU with VF/VT arrest, anoxic brain injury, and multi-organ failure. She has been diagnosed with c-diff colitis, acute renal failure, septic shock, and metabolic acidosis. She has a poor neurologic prognosis and is at risk for herniation. The patient's family has expressed that they do not want her to ""live like a vegetable"" and are considering changing her code status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Herniation: The patient's anisocoria and equal pupils with minimal-to-no reactivity to light are concerning for herniation.
2. Neurologic deterioration: The patient's poor neurologic prognosis and lack of response to sedation and EEG suppression suggest a high risk of further neurologic deterioration.
3. Sepsis: The patient's c-diff colitis, UTI, and septic shock increase her risk of developing sepsis and organ failure.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's muddy brown casts and ATN suggest a high risk of acute kidney injury.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's rising PT, PTT, and INR suggest a risk of coagulopathy, which could lead to bleeding or thrombotic complications.
6. Liver dysfunction: The patient's rising LFTs and abnormal AST, alk phos, and LDH suggest a risk of liver dysfunction, which could lead to further organ failure.
7. Lactic acidosis: The patient's improving lactic acidosis suggests that her cardiac output is improving, but she is still at risk for further acidosis and organ failure.
8. Rhythm disturbances: The patient's LBBB and potential for further arrhythmias increase her risk of cardiac complications.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation increase her risk of further respiratory complications.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's neurologic status and consider changing her code status if her prognosis worsens.
2. Continue to treat her c-diff colitis and septic shock with antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation.
3. Monitor her renal function and consider initiating dialysis if her creatinine levels continue to rise.
4. Continue to manage her coagulopathy with FFP and cryoprecipitate as needed.
5. Monitor her liver function and consider performing a RUQ US if her LFTs continue to rise.
6. Continue to monitor her lactic acidosis and cardiac output, and consider adjusting her pressor support and fluid resuscitation as needed.
7. Monitor her rhythm and consider restarting beta-blockers if her pressures improve.
8. Continue to monitor her respiratory status and consider weaning her off mechanical ventilation if her condition improves.
9. Consider consulting with a cardiothoracic surgeon to discuss potential surgical options for her c-diff colitis and acute kidney injury."

   CT head [**1-1**] (my read): right hemisphere significantly edematous, no
   midline shift. Significantly different from CT head from [**12-30**]
   KUB [**1-1**] (my read): transverse colon distension slightly improved
   compared to the prior KUB, stomach decompressed, tip of OGT in
   appropriate location
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient was found down in rehab, unclear how
   long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on arctic sun
   cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
   AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in
   the presence of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation
   completely wears off before final neuro status and neurologic prognosis
   determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], patient was noted to have anisocoria
   (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm reactive
   to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head with EEG leads on
   showed that right-sided brain is completely edematous with no obvious
   midline shift.  Pupils are equal at 2.5mm this morning, with
   minimal-to-no reactivity to light.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - f/u on final head CT read
   - get repeat CT head when EEG leads are off
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin for CVA prevention
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - if poor neurologic prognosis, need to reconsider code status
   (currently full)
   - family meeting this pm after husband flies from [**State 1771**] to see her, it
   would be useful to have neuro present during the meeting
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levophed on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but needs to have neuro status
   assessment prior to any surgical planning.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl, PR vanc 250mg
   QID
   - serial KUBs to eval toxic megacolon, look for free air and evidence
   of perforation
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - f/u surgery recs
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.
   - f/u renal recs
   - will initiate HD today
   - trend lytes and renal function daily
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - aggressive NS bolus
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips, but was shocked by AED twice.  Most likely
   etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia, ischemia
   after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18 hour Artic
   sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12
   noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RISBI and Breathing trials
   - f/u neuro recs
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   - if pt recovers neurologically, she would be a candidate for ICD
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta 0.27).  Anion gap acidosis is likely
   from lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - continue aggressive volume resuscitation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT (18), PTT (89.8) an INR (1.6).  In the
   setting of sepsis, concerning for DIC.  Could also be due to liver
   failure, however LFT is not terribly abnormal.   Also could be
   secondary to starvation and vitK deficiency.
   - f/u fibrinogen
   - can consider give pt IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will need FFP if actively bleeding
   - will give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely as part of the multi-organ failure in septic shock.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - aggressively fluid resuscitate pt given c.diff colitis
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - if patient recovers, she will need a ICD
   - if BP improves, will restart BB
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct downtrended on [**12-31**] to 26.4 secondary to
   hemodilution from IVF boluses.
   - follow hct daily
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.
   - continue albuterol nebs prn
   .
   # Gout: patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.
   - holding allopurinol in ARF

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   24 Hour Events:
   - neuro thinks pt is doing poorly from neuro status stand point
   - anuric, given 2L NS followed by another 1L NS, low dose dopamine
   started while levophed was weaned off, with hope to increase renal
   perfusion, but HR went to 120s-130s, dopamine discontinued, neo
   started, HR better, BP in the 100s, but UOP still close to zero

   midline shift. Significantly different from CT head from [**12-30**]
   KUB [**1-1**] (my read): transverse colon distension slightly improved
   compared to the prior KUB, stomach decompressed, tip of OGT in
   appropriate location
   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
   # Anoxic brain injury: Patient was found down in rehab, unclear how
   long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on arctic sun
   cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
   AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in
   the presence of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation
   completely wears off before final neuro status and neurologic prognosis
   determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], patient was noted to have anisocoria
   (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light, left pupil 2mm reactive
   to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head with EEG leads on
   showed that right-sided brain is completely edematous with no obvious
   midline shift.  Pupils are equal at 2.5mm this morning, with
   minimal-to-no reactivity to light.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - f/u on final head CT read
   - get repeat CT head when EEG leads are off
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin for CVA prevention
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - if poor neurologic prognosis, need to reconsider code status
   (currently full)
   - family meeting this pm after husband flies from [**State 1771**] to see her, it
   would be useful to have neuro present during the meeting
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levophed on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but needs to have neuro status
   assessment prior to any surgical planning.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl, PR vanc 250mg
   QID
   - serial KUBs to eval toxic megacolon, look for free air and evidence
   of perforation
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - f/u surgery recs
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.
   - f/u renal recs
   - will initiate HD today
   - trend lytes and renal function daily
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - aggressive NS bolus
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips, but was shocked by AED twice.  Most likely
   etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia, ischemia
   after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18 hour Artic
   sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**] at 12
   noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - Wean sedation as tolerates, RISBI and Breathing trials
   - f/u neuro recs
   - assess neurologic status
   - Resume beta-blockers once BP allows & pressors weaned
   - if pt recovers neurologically, she would be a candidate for ICD
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta 0.27).  Anion gap acidosis is likely
   from lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - continue to monitor ABGs
   - continue aggressive volume resuscitation
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT (18), PTT (89.8) an INR (1.6).  In the
   setting of sepsis, concerning for DIC.  Could also be due to liver
   failure, however LFT is not terribly abnormal.   Also could be
   secondary to starvation and vitK deficiency.
   - f/u fibrinogen
   - can consider give pt IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will need FFP if actively bleeding
   - will give cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely as part of the multi-organ failure in septic shock.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - aggressively fluid resuscitate pt given c.diff colitis
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   - Re-start BB with improved pressures & off pressors
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - if patient recovers, she will need a ICD
   - if BP improves, will restart BB
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct downtrended on [**12-31**] to 26.4 secondary to
   hemodilution from IVF boluses.
   - follow hct daily
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.
   - continue albuterol nebs prn
   .
   # Gout: patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.

   Disposition :  CCU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including CAD, NSTEMI, HTN, and CHF, who experienced a VT arrest. She is currently in the ICU with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including acute renal failure, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy, and liver dysfunction.

The patient's condition is rapidly deteriorating, with worsening renal function, acidosis, and coagulopathy. She has anisocoria, which is concerning for herniation, and her pupils are equal but minimally reactive to light. Her neurologic status is poor, with global suppression on EEG and no response to sternal rub or voice.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with muddy brown casts, likely due to sepsis, c-diff infection, and intravascular dryness.
2. Sepsis-induced multi-organ failure, including kidney, liver, and brain.
3. Metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactate acidosis, starvation ketone acidosis, and diarrhea.
4. Coagulopathy, potentially due to sepsis, liver failure, or starvation and vitK deficiency.
5. Liver dysfunction, likely secondary to sepsis.
6. Leukocytosis with bandemia, likely due to c-diff infection and UTI.
7. Lactic acidosis, likely related to low cardiac output and pressors.
8. Coronary artery disease with slightly elevated troponin, likely due to arrhythmia.
9. Anemia, likely due to iron deficiency and acute disease.
10. Mitral regurgitation, stable per TTE.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and pressor support to maintain MAP goal of 60.
2. Continuous bicarbonate infusion to manage metabolic acidosis.
3. Hemodialysis initiation to manage acute renal failure.
4. Antibiotics for c-diff infection and UTI.
5. Vasopressors to manage septic shock.
6. Sedation weaning and RISBI and breathing trials to assess neurologic status.
7. Consideration of ICD implantation if patient recovers neurologically.
8. Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now.
9. Monitoring of ABGs, lactate, and coagulation studies.
10. Serial imaging studies to monitor for signs of herniation and toxic megacolon.

The patient's family is aware of her poor neurologic prognosis and has expressed a desire to withdraw life-sustaining therapies if her condition does not improve. A family meeting is planned for this afternoon to discuss code status and end-of-life care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
# Brain injury: Per neuro:
patient has irreversible hypoxic-ischemic [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] as well as a large brain infarct that was embolic.
  Patient was found down
 in rehab, unclear how long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on a
rctic sun cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in the presenc
e of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation completely wears off before
final neuro status and neurologic prognosis determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], pa
tient was noted to have anisocoria (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light,
 left pupil 2mm reactive to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head w
ith EEG leads on showed large MCA stroke.  Patient has no brainstem reflexes.
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - will discuss with family today re withdrawal of care as there is no
   realistic expectation that pt will ever recover from this brain injury
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but not a surgical candidate given
   her brain injury and stroke.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - KUB stable, can hold off on serial KUBs
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.  No HD will be initiated given poor neuro
   status.
   - f/u renal recs
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
# Brain injury: Per neuro:
patient has irreversible hypoxic-ischemic [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] as well as a large brain infarct that was embolic.
  Patient was found down
 in rehab, unclear how long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on a
rctic sun cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in the presenc
e of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation completely wears off before
final neuro status and neurologic prognosis determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], pa
tient was noted to have anisocoria (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light,
 left pupil 2mm reactive to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head w
ith EEG leads on showed large MCA stroke.  Patient has no brainstem reflexes.
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - will discuss with family today re withdrawal of care as there is no
   realistic expectation that pt will ever recover from this brain injury
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but not a surgical candidate given
   her brain injury and stroke.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - KUB stable, can hold off on serial KUBs
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.  No HD will be initiated given poor neuro
   status.
   - f/u renal recs
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor

   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate

   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips from rehab, but was shocked by AED twice.
   Most likely etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia,
   ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18
   hour Artic sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**]

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Neurological: The patient has a grave prognosis with irreversible hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and a large brain infarct. She has no brainstem reflexes and is not responsive to stimuli.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has heart failure with an EF of 15-20% and is on pressors to maintain blood pressure. She has a history of NSTEMI and is on aspirin, plavix, and statin.
* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a goal pCO2 of 27-30. She has coarse breath sounds bilaterally.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 3.6 and is on dialysis. She has a history of kidney disease and is on lisinopril and spironolactone.
* Hepatic: The patient has liver dysfunction with elevated LFTs and is at risk for liver failure.
* Coagulation: The patient has a coagulopathy with rising PT, PTT, and INR. She is at risk for bleeding and is on heparin and FFP.
* Infectious: The patient has a severe c-diff infection with a heavy growth of staph aureus. She is on antibiotics and has a risk of sepsis.
* Metabolic: The patient has metabolic acidosis with anion gap acidosis and non-anion gap acidosis. She is on bicarbonate and has a goal pH of 7.35.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further deterioration of the patient's neurological status
* Development of septic shock or multi-organ failure
* Progression of liver dysfunction to liver failure
* Bleeding complications due to coagulopathy
* Development of respiratory failure or ventilator-associated pneumonia
* Further deterioration of the patient's cardiovascular status
* Development of acute kidney injury or need for dialysis
* Development of metabolic acidosis or lactic acidosis

Based on the patient's condition, the physician is likely to withdraw care and focus on comfort care measures."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
# Brain injury: Per neuro:
patient has irreversible hypoxic-ischemic [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] as well as a large brain infarct that was embolic.
  Patient was found down
 in rehab, unclear how long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on a
rctic sun cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in the presenc
e of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation completely wears off before
final neuro status and neurologic prognosis determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], pa
tient was noted to have anisocoria (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light,
 left pupil 2mm reactive to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head w
ith EEG leads on showed large MCA stroke.  Patient has no brainstem reflexes.
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - will discuss with family today re withdrawal of care as there is no
   realistic expectation that pt will ever recover from this brain injury
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but not a surgical candidate given
   her brain injury and stroke.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - KUB stable, can hold off on serial KUBs
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.  No HD will be initiated given poor neuro
   status.
   - f/u renal recs
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - NS bolus prn
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips from rehab, but was shocked by AED twice.
   Most likely etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia,
   ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18
   hour Artic sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**]
   at 12 noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - will likely withdraw care today
   - no meaningful recovery will occur for ICD placement
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta <1).  Anion gap acidosis is likely from
   lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - will likely withdraw care
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT, PTT an INR.  Fibrinogen normal, less
   concerning for DIC.  Could be due to liver injury, however LFT is not
   terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary to starvation and vitK
   deficiency.
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will give FFP if actively bleeding
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - NS boluses prn
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - pt unlikely to make meaningful recovery for ICH placement
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct 26 today, secondary to hemodilution from IVF
   boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.  Patient has no
   spontaneous respiration, no albuterol needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
# Brain injury: Per neuro:
patient has irreversible hypoxic-ischemic [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] as well as a large brain infarct that was embolic.
  Patient was found down
 in rehab, unclear how long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on a
rctic sun cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in the presenc
e of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation completely wears off before
final neuro status and neurologic prognosis determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], pa
tient was noted to have anisocoria (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light,
 left pupil 2mm reactive to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head w
ith EEG leads on showed large MCA stroke.  Patient has no brainstem reflexes.
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - will discuss with family today re withdrawal of care as there is no
   realistic expectation that pt will ever recover from this brain injury
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but not a surgical candidate given
   her brain injury and stroke.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - KUB stable, can hold off on serial KUBs
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.  No HD will be initiated given poor neuro
   status.
   - f/u renal recs
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - NS bolus prn
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips from rehab, but was shocked by AED twice.
   Most likely etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia,
   ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18
   hour Artic sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**]
   at 12 noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - will likely withdraw care today
   - no meaningful recovery will occur for ICD placement
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta <1).  Anion gap acidosis is likely from
   lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - will likely withdraw care
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT, PTT an INR.  Fibrinogen normal, less
   concerning for DIC.  Could be due to liver injury, however LFT is not
   terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary to starvation and vitK
   deficiency.
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will give FFP if actively bleeding
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - NS boluses prn
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - pt unlikely to make meaningful recovery for ICH placement
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   She has sustained a large MCA stroke with loss of brainstemreflexes
   from hypoxic injury. She is DNR per the family. Will discuss withdrawal
   of therapy / CMO today.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3876**], MD
   on:[**2132-1-2**] 10:22 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient, a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, NSTEMI, HTN, and sCHF, suffered a VT arrest and was found to have a large MCA stroke with loss of brainstem reflexes due to hypoxic injury. She was diagnosed with acute renal failure, septic shock, and metabolic acidosis, and was treated with antibiotics, IV fluids, and pressors. She also had a coagulopathy, liver dysfunction, and leukocytosis with bandemia.

The patient's condition is grave, with a poor prognosis for recovery. The neuro team has communicated to the family that the patient has an irreversible hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and will not recover. The family has been informed of this and has spent time processing the news.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
* Heart rate: 83 bpm
* Blood pressure: 86/40 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Central venous pressure: 15 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 32.6 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 172 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 3.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 19 mg/dL
* Glucose: 118 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 13 mmol/L

The patient's medical complications include:

* Acute renal failure
* Septic shock
* Metabolic acidosis
* Coagulopathy
* Liver dysfunction
* Leukocytosis with bandemia
* Lactic acidosis
* Rhythm disturbances (atrial fibrillation)

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Supportive care for septic shock
* Antibiotics for c-diff infection
* IV fluids and pressors for hypotension
* Hyperventilation to reduce intracranial pressure
* Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results

The patient's prognosis is poor, and it is likely that she will not recover from her brain injury. The family has been informed of this and has spent time processing the news. Withdrawal of care is being considered, and the patient's code status is DNR."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known firstname 1012**] [**Known lastname **] [**Last Name (un) **] is a very nice 76 year-old woman with
   history of CAD s/p CABG x 4, recent NSTEMI in [**11-4**], HTN, sCHF (EF
   25-30% prior to this admission) who had VT arrest.
   .
# Brain injury: Per neuro:
patient has irreversible hypoxic-ischemic [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (un) **] as well as a large brain infarct that was embolic.
  Patient was found down
 in rehab, unclear how long pt was out before she was shocked.  Patient was on a
rctic sun cooling protocol for 18hrs, and has been off sedation since [**12-31**] early
AM.  EEG shows global suppression, but given pt was on versed and in the presenc
e of renal failure, may need to wait until sedation completely wears off before
final neuro status and neurologic prognosis determined.  On the night of [**12-31**], pa
tient was noted to have anisocoria (right pupil 4mm minimally reactive to light,
 left pupil 2mm reactive to light), concerning for herniation.  Repeat CT head w
ith EEG leads on showed large MCA stroke.  Patient has no brainstem reflexes.
   - f/u on EEG result
   - f/u on neuro recs
   - hyperventilation to reduce ICP, goal pCO2 27-30
   - keep HOB at 30 degree
   - hold off on mannitol given acute renal failure, acidosis, and
   hypotension
   - continue aspirin, plavix, statin
   - per patient's daughters, patient stated that she would not want to
   ""live like vegetable""
   - will discuss with family today re withdrawal of care as there is no
   realistic expectation that pt will ever recover from this brain injury
   .
   # C. Diff colitis: Patient had diarrhea at rehab, and levofloxacin on
   admission did not help. It is very possible that when she was cooled,
   the c-diff pooled and was delivered in a large bolus upon rewarming.
   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but not a surgical candidate given
   her brain injury and stroke.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - KUB stable, can hold off on serial KUBs
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.  No HD will be initiated given poor neuro
   status.
   - f/u renal recs
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - NS bolus prn
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips from rehab, but was shocked by AED twice.
   Most likely etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia,
   ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18
   hour Artic sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**]
   at 12 noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - will likely withdraw care today
   - no meaningful recovery will occur for ICD placement
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta <1).  Anion gap acidosis is likely from
   lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - will likely withdraw care
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT, PTT an INR.  Fibrinogen normal, less
   concerning for DIC.  Could be due to liver injury, however LFT is not
   terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary to starvation and vitK
   deficiency.
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will give FFP if actively bleeding
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - NS boluses prn
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - pt unlikely to make meaningful recovery for ICH placement
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct 26 today, secondary to hemodilution from IVF
   boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.  Patient has no
   spontaneous respiration, no albuterol needed.
   .
   # Gout: patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient was started on antibiotics for c.diff on [**12-31**], KUB in the
   evening of [**12-31**] shows evidence of early toxic megacolon. Pt meets the
   surgical indication for colectomy but not a surgical candidate given
   her brain injury and stroke.
   - continue PO vanc 500 mg q6, IV flagyl 500 mg q8 Flagyl
   - KUB stable, can hold off on serial KUBs
   - serial q4 abdominal exams
   - follow WBC and fever curves
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Patient with baseline Cr 1.4-1.5, admitted with
   Cr of 3.3 in context of poor PO intake on lisinopril and
   spironolactone, dirty U/A and c.diff infection which likely started
   when she was in rehab. Urine lytes suggestive of pre-renal etiology;
   creatinine improved to 2.4 with hydration. However, creatinine worsened
   on [**12-31**] with no UOP despite IVF boluses. Urine showed muddy brown casts,
   consistent with ATN.  UA consistent with pre-renal etiology.  No urine
   eos.  The etiology is multifactorial and related to sepsis/cdiff,
   intravascular dryness, and pressors.  UOP minimally responded to IVF
   boluses, low dose dopamine.  No HD will be initiated given poor neuro
   status.
   - f/u renal recs
   - trend lytes and renal function [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - continue to hold spironolactone & lisinopril
   .
   # Septic shock: likely secondary to c.diff infection.  Patient required
   pressor support with dopamine (up to 7) which increased with warming.
   The pressor was switched to Norepi (0.04) on [**2131-12-30**], switched to neo on
   [**12-31**] for tachycardia.  With multi-organ failure, including kidney,
   liver, and brain.
   - continue to wean her down on pressor
   - NS bolus prn
   - Holding ACEI and spironolactone and lasix for now
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - maintain MAP goal 60
   - cV02 goal >70%
   - follow lactate
   .
   # VF/VT Arrest: No strips from rehab, but was shocked by AED twice.
   Most likely etiologies for VF/VT arrest is renal failure/hyperkalemia,
   ischemia after NSTEMI in [**11-4**], and heart failure with EF 15-20%. 18
   hour Artic sun protocol commenced on [**2131-12-29**] AM, and completed at [**2131-12-30**]
   at 12 noon. TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] demonstrated an EF of 15-20%, with
   akinesis of the LV inferior wall and basal to mid hypokinesis
   elsewhere, though the inferior wall akinesis was seen on prior ECHO on
   [**11-4**], likely representing stunned myocardium.
   - wean pressors as tolerates
   - will likely withdraw care today
   - no meaningful recovery will occur for ICD placement
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Both anion gap (gap 15) and non-anion gap
   metabolic acidosis (delta-delta <1).  Anion gap acidosis is likely from
   lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis.  Non-anion gap
   acidosis is likely from diarrhea and NS she received yesterday. pH
   7.35, from hyperventilation on the vent.
   - continue hyperventilation on vent, keep pCO2 27-30
   - continue bicarb gtt at 75cc/hr
   - will likely withdraw care
   .
   # Coagulopathy: rising PT, PTT an INR.  Fibrinogen normal, less
   concerning for DIC.  Could be due to liver injury, however LFT is not
   terribly abnormal.   Also could be secondary to starvation and vitK
   deficiency.
   - hold off on IV vitK
   - continue to trend
   - will give FFP if actively bleeding
   - heparin sc discontinued, pneumoboots on for DVT ppx
   .
   # Liver dysfunction: LFT rising. AST, alk phos and LDH abnormal.
   Likely due to hepatic congestion, less likely shock liver since LFTs
   are not very high.
   - treat sepsis as above
   - continue to monitor
   - no RUQ US for now given this is most likely secondary to sepsis
   .
   # Leukocytosis with bandemia: secondary to c.diff.  UTI contributes to
   it as well. CXR no evidence of pneumonia.
   - continue to treat c.diff as above
   - f/u all cultures
   - continue to trend WBC and fever curve
   .
   # Lactic Acidosis: improving; related to low cardiac output and
   pressors. Feet are clearly hypoperfused (bilaterally)
   - continue to follow
   - NS boluses prn
   - maintain MAP goal of 60
   .
   # Rhythm: See above. Currently on NSR with LBBB without meeting
   criteria for ACS.
   - Holding beta-blocker for now given hypotension
   .
   # Pump: Patient with heart failure and EF of 25-30% after NSTEMI in
   [**Month (only) 1780**], now with EF of 15-20%, likely stunned myocardium.
   - pt unlikely to make meaningful recovery for ICH placement
   .
   # Coronaries: Pt with slightly elevated troponin secondary to arrrest.
   No ECG changes compatible for ischemia and negative MB.
   - Continue lipitor 80, ASA, plavix
   .
   # Anemia: Normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW. Ferritin of
   1249, TIBC 226, TRF 174, Iron 30 in [**Month (only) **]/09 suggesting iron deficiency.
   Reticulocyte of 7.6 at that time (4.05 corrected and 2 with double
   correction) suggesting a component of acute disease with good marrow
   production. Reticulocyte count on [**2131-12-29**] low at 1.2; B12 and folate
   wnl. Transfused with one unit of pRBC on [**2131-12-30**] for hct 24 with
   response to 29.  Hct 26 today, secondary to hemodilution from IVF
   boluses.
   - follow hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - no transfusion
   .
   # Mitral regurgitation: Stable per TTE performed on [**2131-12-29**] compared to
   prior.
   .
   # Asthma: No wheezes or signs of exacerbation.  Patient has no
   spontaneous respiration, no albuterol needed.
   .
   # Gout: patient has impressive tophaceous gout R>L on the feet.
   - holding allopurinol in ARF

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient, a 76-year-old woman with a history of CAD, NSTEMI, HTN, and CHF, is in a critical condition with multiple medical complications. The patient's condition is as follows:

1. Brain Injury: The patient has suffered an irreversible hypoxic-ischemic brain injury with a large brain infarct, likely due to embolic stroke. She has no brainstem reflexes and is not responsive to stimuli.
2. C. Diff Colitis: The patient has developed C. diff colitis, which is likely secondary to her recent antibiotic use and cooling protocol. She has evidence of early toxic megacolon and is not a surgical candidate due to her brain injury and stroke.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to sepsis, c. diff infection, intravascular dryness, and pressors. Her urine output is minimally responsive to IVF boluses, and she has muddy brown casts consistent with ATN.
4. Septic Shock: The patient is likely in septic shock, secondary to c. diff infection, with multi-organ failure, including kidney, liver, and brain.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, likely due to lactate acidosis and starvation ketone acidosis, with an anion gap acidosis and non-anion gap acidosis.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has rising PT, PTT, and INR, likely due to liver injury, starvation, and vitamin K deficiency.
7. Liver Dysfunction: The patient has liver dysfunction, likely due to hepatic congestion, with rising LFTs.
8. Leukocytosis with Bandemia: The patient has leukocytosis with bandemia, likely secondary to c. diff infection and UTI.
9. Lactic Acidosis: The patient has lactic acidosis, improving with low cardiac output and pressors.
10. Rhythm: The patient is currently in NSR with LBBB, without meeting criteria for ACS.
11. Pump Failure: The patient has pump failure, likely due to stunned myocardium, with an EF of 15-20%.
12. Coronaries: The patient has slightly elevated troponin, likely secondary to arrest, with no ECG changes compatible with ischemia and negative MB.
13. Anemia: The patient has normocytic normochromic anemia with high RDW, likely due to iron deficiency.
14. Mitral Regurgitation: The patient has stable mitral regurgitation, per TTE.

The patient's medical team is planning to withdraw care due to her poor neurologic status and lack of realistic expectation of recovery. The patient's family has been informed of the situation, and they are considering end-of-life care."
