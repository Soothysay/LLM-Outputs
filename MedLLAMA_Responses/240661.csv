   54 yo male with SCC of the tongue recently finished chemo and
   undergoing XRT, who presents with chronic n/v related to his gtube as
   well as newly diagnosed PE and fevers.
   .
   #. PE: documented PE by CTA.  Chest pain less likely cardiac given
   history, known PE, first set of negative enzymes, and similar EKG.
   Underlying risk factors for PE include SCC, recent chemo/XRT, and
   reduced mobility at home [**1-7**] treatment- and poor nutrition-induced
   fatigue. Pt started on heparin gtt. Head CT did not show any acute
   abnormalities that would be concerning for bleed.
   - heparin IV drip by weight-based protocol
   - discuss long term anticoagulation with oncologist (coumadin vs.
   Lovenox)
   .
   #. Fevers: potentially related to PE, but pna also in differential.  UA
   negative and BCx pending.  He is not neutrapenic by CBC/diff.  Received
   cefepime and levofloxacin in the ED.  Given likely immunosuppression
   and recent hospitalization, would favor covering broadly for HCAP for
   now.
   - continue cefepime, levo, vancomycin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, with no conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus
* Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, normal rate, with normal S1 and S2 sounds
* Lungs: Mild diffuse rhonchi, with increased TTP over the left lower chest
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, and non-distended
* Extremities: No edema or calf pain, with 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses
* Skin: No rashes or lesions, with ecchymoses
* Neurological: Alert and oriented, with grossly intact cranial nerves and preserved sensation and strength

The patient's laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 3.3 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 30.3%
* Platelet count: 208 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 98 mg/dL

The patient is receiving the following medications:

* Heparin sodium infusion: 1,700 units/hour
* Hydromorphone (Dilaudid): 11:40 PM
* Cefipime: 04:07 AM
* Vancomycin: 10:07 PM

The patient is at risk for the following medical complications:

* Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to his history of SCC, recent chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and reduced mobility
* Fever and sepsis due to his immunosuppressed state and recent hospitalization
* Nausea and vomiting related to his g-tube and potential bowel obstruction
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to his history of SCC and recent chemotherapy and radiation therapy
* Respiratory failure due to his mild diffuse rhonchi and increased TTP over the left lower chest

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing heparin infusion for DVT prophylaxis
* Continuing antibiotics for potential HCAP and pneumonia
* Discussing long-term anticoagulation with the oncologist
* Advancing the g-tube and considering a nutrition consult
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis and adjusting antibiotics as necessary
* Managing nausea and vomiting with antiemetic medications
* Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as necessary
* Monitoring for signs of respiratory failure and adjusting oxygen therapy as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo male with SCC of the tongue recently finished chemo and
   undergoing XRT, who presents with chronic n/v related to his gtube as
   well as newly diagnosed PE and fevers.
   .
   #. PE: documented PE by CTA.  Chest pain less likely cardiac given
   history, known PE, first set of negative enzymes, and similar EKG.
   Underlying risk factors for PE include SCC, recent chemo/XRT, and
   reduced mobility at home [**1-7**] treatment- and poor nutrition-induced
   fatigue. Pt started on heparin gtt. Head CT did not show any acute
   abnormalities that would be concerning for bleed.
   - heparin IV drip by weight-based protocol
   - discuss long term anticoagulation with oncologist (coumadin vs.
   Lovenox)
   - TTE to evaluate for RV strain
   - check BNP to evaluate volume status
   .
   #. Fevers: potentially related to PE, but too high to not consider
   alternative dx. PNA is most likely in differential given LLL findings
   on CXR and CT c/w non-specific ground glass opacities.  UA negative and
   BCx pending.  Although patient is not neutropenic, he is somewhat
   immunosuppressed from chemo and malignancy, and we would opt to treat
   more conservately with abx for now rather than monitor off abx.
   - continue levaquin for 8 day course
   - D/C vanco and cefepime and monitor fevers, WBC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue, recently completed chemotherapy, and undergoing radiation therapy. The patient presents with chronic nausea and vomiting related to his gastrostomy tube (g-tube), newly diagnosed pulmonary embolism (PE), and fevers.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 38.2°C (100.8°F)
* Heart rate: 90 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 122/75 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Mild diffuse rhonchi in the left lower lobe (LLL) with TTP over the left lower chest
* No edema or calf pain
* 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses
* No rashes or lesions
* Appropriate cognitive function and sensation
* 5/5 strength throughout
* Normal coordination and gait assessment deferred

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 3.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 208 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* TropT: <0.01
* Glucose: 98 mg/dL

The patient has been started on heparin infusion for anticoagulation, and further evaluation with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is planned to assess for right ventricular strain and volume status.

The patient's fevers are potentially related to the PE, but alternative diagnoses such as pneumonia (PNA) are also considered. The patient is being treated with levaquin for 8 days, and vancomycin and cefepime have been discontinued.

The patient's nausea and vomiting are managed with a bowel regimen, and pain control is achieved with hydromorphone (Dilaudid) as needed. The patient's g-tube is being held until it is advanced, and a nutrition consult is planned.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE) progression or recurrence
2. Pneumonia (PNA) development
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy
4. Infection or sepsis related to the g-tube or other invasive devices
5. Malnutrition or dehydration due to prolonged tube feeding or inadequate nutrition
6. Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to PE or PNA
7. Cardiac complications such as right ventricular strain or heart failure due to PE or PNA
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the g-tube or other causes
9. Infection or sepsis related to the patient's underlying malignancy or immunosuppressive therapy
10. Psychological distress or anxiety related to the patient's condition and treatment."

   TTE:
   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
   size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. The aortic root
   is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Final CTA read:
   1. Multiple segmental and subsegmental PEs, as described above. There
   is
   also a larger lobar pulmonary embolus in the left lower lobar pulmonary
   artery.
   2. Scattered ground-glass nodular consolidations throughout the basilar
   part
   of the left lower lobe, most likely associated with abnormal perfusion
   given
   the presence of a large essentially occlusive pulmonary embolism
   serving this
   area. Less likely considerations are an additional inflammatory or
   infectious
   process. Chest CT surveillance is suggest in three months to show
   resolution,
   particularly given the history of malignancy. However, these nodules
   are not
   suggestive of metastases.
   3. Small hypodense renal lesions, probably cysts, but not entirely
   characterized. Confirmation with ultrasound is recommended.
   Assessment and Plan
   54 yo male with SCC of the tongue recently finished chemo and
   undergoing XRT, who presents with chronic n/v related to his gtube as

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue who recently completed chemotherapy and is undergoing radiation therapy. He was admitted to the ICU with chronic nausea and vomiting related to his gastrostomy tube, as well as newly diagnosed pulmonary embolisms (PEs). The patient has a history of mild aortic regurgitation and a focal wall motion abnormality on echocardiogram, which cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal technical quality. He is receiving heparin IV drip and is being considered for long-term anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Complications:
	* Pulmonary infarction or hemorrhage due to large PE in the left lower lobe.
	* Respiratory failure or arrest due to PE-induced hypoxia.
	* Cardiac complications, such as right ventricular strain or failure, due to PE.
2. Infection Complications:
	* Bacterial or fungal infections related to the gastrostomy tube or pulmonary embolism.
	* Sepsis or septic shock due to infection.
3. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Heart failure or cardiac arrest due to aortic regurgitation or other cardiac conditions.
	* Arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities due to cardiac stress or electrolyte imbalances.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to gastrostomy tube placement or radiation therapy.
	* Nausea and vomiting related to chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
5. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections due to prolonged intubation or respiratory failure.
	* Respiratory failure or arrest due to chronic lung disease or other respiratory conditions.
6. Hematological Complications:
	* Bleeding or hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy.
	* Anemia or bleeding due to chronic blood loss or chemotherapy.
7. Neurological Complications:
	* Seizures or encephalopathy due to chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
	* Cognitive impairment or memory loss due to chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's condition, as well as coordination with the patient's oncologist and other healthcare providers to ensure optimal care."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   TTE:
   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
   size, and global systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to
   suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be
   fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect. The aortic root
   is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened (?#). There is no aortic valve stenosis. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be
   determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Final CTA read:
   1. Multiple segmental and subsegmental PEs, as described above. There
   is
   also a larger lobar pulmonary embolus in the left lower lobar pulmonary
   artery.
   2. Scattered ground-glass nodular consolidations throughout the basilar
   part
   of the left lower lobe, most likely associated with abnormal perfusion
   given
   the presence of a large essentially occlusive pulmonary embolism
   serving this
   area. Less likely considerations are an additional inflammatory or
   infectious
   process. Chest CT surveillance is suggest in three months to show
   resolution,
   particularly given the history of malignancy. However, these nodules
   are not
   suggestive of metastases.
   3. Small hypodense renal lesions, probably cysts, but not entirely
   characterized. Confirmation with ultrasound is recommended.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue, recently finished chemotherapy, and undergoing radiation therapy (XRT). He presents to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with chronic nausea and vomiting related to his gastrostomy tube (g-tube), as well as newly diagnosed pulmonary embolisms (PEs). The patient has a focal wall motion abnormality on echocardiogram, which cannot be fully excluded, and mild aortic regurgitation. He is receiving heparin infusions and has been prescribed lansoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's PEs may lead to respiratory failure, especially considering the presence of ground-glass nodular consolidations in the left lower lobe.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's focal wall motion abnormality and mild aortic regurgitation may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's chronic nausea and vomiting, as well as his use of anticoagulation therapy, may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of PEs may increase his risk of infection, particularly respiratory or bloodstream infections.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient's small hypodense renal lesions, likely cysts, may increase his risk of renal insufficiency or failure.
6. Thrombotic complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of thrombotic complications, such as bleeding or deep vein thrombosis.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's chronic nausea and vomiting may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which may worsen his overall health and increase his risk of complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolus. He has a history of cancer, coronary artery disease, and chronic aspiration. He is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin and is being treated for acute pain, alteration in nutrition, alteration in elimination related to constipation, and fever of unknown origin. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/72 mmHg. His respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen and ABG results show a pH of 7.27. His physical examination is notable for right and left lower extremity edema, and his laboratory results show a WBC count of 3.3, Hct of 30.3, and Plt of 208.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to his history of cancer and pulmonary embolus. Anticoagulation therapy with heparin is necessary to prevent further thrombosis.
2. Chronic aspiration: The patient's history of chronic aspiration makes him at risk for aspiration pneumonia. Prophylactic antibiotics and aggressive airway management are necessary to prevent this complication.
3. Constipation: The patient's history of constipation makes him at risk for bowel obstruction. Aggressive bowel management and laxative therapy are necessary to prevent this complication.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes and use of insulin therapy makes him at risk for hyperglycemia. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjustments to insulin therapy are necessary to prevent this complication.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of pulmonary embolus and chronic aspiration makes him at risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status and aggressive respiratory support are necessary to prevent this complication.
6. Infection: The patient's history of cancer and chronic aspiration makes him at risk for infection. Close monitoring of laboratory results and aggressive antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent this complication.
7. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy with heparin makes him at risk for bleeding. Close monitoring of laboratory results and adjustments to anticoagulation therapy are necessary to prevent this complication.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including DVT, chronic aspiration, constipation, hyperglycemia, respiratory failure, infection, and bleeding. Close monitoring of laboratory results, vital signs, and physical examination findings is necessary to prevent these complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."
