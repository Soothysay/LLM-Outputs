   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Most likely etiology is hypokalemia in the
   setting of diuresis with lasix. Discontinuation of dofetalide may also
   be contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome,
   which is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less
   likely in the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal
   phosphate. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately.
   - Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia stat
   - Recheck K and tumor lysis labs
   - Check TSH
   - If e/o increased tumor lysis will d/w hem/onc re slowing rate of
   chemotherapy
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Amiodarone bolus and drip
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - Lidocaine at bedside in case overdrive pacing fails
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec.
   - Continue Gleevec 400mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - [**Hospital1 **] tumor lysis labs
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 100mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (clarify with hem/onc
   if correct dose)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appears slightly
   hypervolemic. Would benefit from diuresis, however will hold off given
   v tach and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Hold on diuresis for now
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - Clarify with hem/onc why holding coumadin
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # CKD: Stable, improved from baseline.
   - Consider restarting dofetilide, will d/w EP in AM
   - Monitor Cr
   .
   # CAD: No active issues.
   - Continue asa
   - No statin due to myopathy
   .
   # DM: No active issues.
   - Glargine 23 HS
   - SSI
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: No active issues.
   - Continue synthroid
   - Checking TSH
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac/diabetic diet
   .
   # ACCESS: 2 PIVs
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots for now
   -Pain management with acetaminophen
   -Bowel regimen with docusate/senna PRN
   .
   # CODE:  DNR/DNI but ICD to remain active
   .
   # COMM:  HCP is her daughter [**Name (NI) 3353**] [**Name (NI) 12380**]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12382**].  She DOES

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who was transferred to the ICU from the hematology/oncology department due to ventricular tachycardia (VT). She has a history of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (Afib) and ventricular tachycardia, and is taking Gleevec for her CML. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 98.2°F, heart rate of 85 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/51 mmHg. Her lab results show mild anemia, normal white blood cell count, and elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient's VT is likely caused by hypokalemia, which is a common electrolyte abnormality in patients with CML. The patient's VT is also potentially related to tumor lysis syndrome, which is a metabolic complication of chemotherapy.
2. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of Afib and VT, which may be related to her CML or other underlying cardiac conditions.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other systemic complications.
4. Infection: The patient's neutropenia and elevated white blood cell count may increase her risk of infection.
5. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient's CML may cause tumor lysis syndrome, which is a metabolic complication of chemotherapy that can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, kidney failure, and other systemic complications.
6. Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's chronic systolic heart failure may worsen due to her electrolyte imbalance and cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen due to her electrolyte imbalance and cardiac arrhythmias.

Plan:

1. Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia stat.
2. Recheck K and tumor lysis labs.
3. Check TSH.
4. If e/o increased tumor lysis, slow rate of chemotherapy.
5. Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID.
6. ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating attempts until shock.
7. Lidocaine at bedside in case overdrive pacing fails.
8. EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated.
9. Continue Gleevec 400mg PO Daily.
10. Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea.
11. Clarify with hem/onc if correct dose of allopurinol.
12. Hold on diuresis for now.
13. Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID.
14. Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily.

Summary:

The patient was transferred to the ICU for ventricular tachycardia (VTach). They had another episode of VTach, requiring three override pace attempts to revert to sinus rhythm. The patient is currently on amiodarone infusion and has a nasogastric tube (NG) in place. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/51 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 94%. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics and has a code status of full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of VTach and is currently receiving amiodarone infusion. Further episodes of arrhythmias are possible, and close monitoring is necessary.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes may indicate an underlying infection. Cultures and imaging studies should be considered to rule out infection.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, and close monitoring of vital signs is necessary to ensure hemodynamic stability.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a nasogastric tube in place, and close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is necessary to prevent gastrointestinal complications.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction, and close monitoring of liver function tests is necessary to ensure liver function is not deteriorating.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving nutrition via an IV, and close monitoring of nutritional status is necessary to prevent deficiencies.
7. Blood product transfusions: The patient has received blood products, and close monitoring of blood product levels and potential complications is necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Most likely etiology is hypokalemia in the
   setting of diuresis with lasix. Discontinuation of dofetalide may also
   be contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome,
   which is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less
   likely in the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal
   phosphate. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately.
   - Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia stat
   - Recheck K and tumor lysis labs
   - Check TSH
   - If e/o increased tumor lysis will d/w hem/onc re slowing rate of
   chemotherapy
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Amiodarone bolus and drip
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - Lidocaine at bedside in case overdrive pacing fails
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec.
   - Continue Gleevec 400mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - [**Hospital1 **] tumor lysis labs
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 100mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (clarify with hem/onc
   if correct dose)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appears slightly
   hypervolemic. Would benefit from diuresis, however will hold off given
   v tach and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Hold on diuresis for now
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - Clarify with hem/onc why holding coumadin
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # CKD: Stable, improved from baseline.
   - Consider restarting dofetilide, will d/w EP in AM
   - Monitor Cr
   .
   # CAD: No active issues.
   - Continue asa
   - No statin due to myopathy
   .
   # DM: No active issues.
   - Glargine 23 HS
   - SSI
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: No active issues.
   - Continue synthroid
   - Checking TSH
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac/diabetic diet
   .
   # ACCESS: 2 PIVs
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots for now
   -Pain management with acetaminophen
   -Bowel regimen with docusate/senna PRN
   .
   # CODE:  DNR/DNI but ICD to remain active
   .
   # COMM:  HCP is her daughter [**Name (NI) 3353**] [**Name (NI) 12380**]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12382**].  She DOES
   want her daughter notified regarding this current hospital admission.

   likely in the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal
   phosphate. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia, and is currently in the ICU for management of a recent episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia. The patient has a history of cancer (CML), type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and chronic systolic heart failure.

The patient's current condition is:

* Ventricular tachycardia: Sustained, with a likely etiology of hypokalemia and possibly tumor lysis syndrome.
* Electrolyte abnormalities: Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which need to be corrected stat.
* Cardiac rhythm: First-degree atrioventricular block.

The patient's medications include:

* Amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia
* Gleevec for CML
* Metoprolol for chronic systolic heart failure
* Lasix for diuresis
* Coumadin for anticoagulation (held due to unclear reasons)
* Dofetilide for atrial fibrillation (held due to renal failure)

Potential medical complications:

* Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient's CML treatment may lead to tumor lysis, which can cause cardiac dysrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac arrhythmias and current episode of ventricular tachycardia increase the risk of further arrhythmias.
* Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia need to be corrected to prevent further cardiac complications.
* Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to CML treatment increases the risk of infection.
* Ischemia/hypoxia: The patient's chronic kidney disease and chronic systolic heart failure increase the risk of ischemia and hypoxia.

The patient's goals of care are to avoid external interventions beyond ICD shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable, and to continue Gleevec treatment for CML."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Most likely etiology is hypokalemia in the
   setting of diuresis with lasix. Discontinuation of dofetalide may also
   be contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome,
   which is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less
   likely in the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal
   phosphate. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately.
   - Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia stat
   - Recheck K and tumor lysis labs
   - Check TSH
   - If e/o increased tumor lysis will d/w hem/onc re slowing rate of
   chemotherapy
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Amiodarone bolus and drip
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - Lidocaine at bedside in case overdrive pacing fails
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec.
   - Continue Gleevec 400mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - [**Hospital1 **] tumor lysis labs
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 100mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (clarify with hem/onc
   if correct dose)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appears slightly
   hypervolemic. Would benefit from diuresis, however will hold off given
   v tach and electrolyte abnormalities.
   - Hold on diuresis for now
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - Clarify with hem/onc why holding coumadin
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # CKD: Stable, improved from baseline.
   - Consider restarting dofetilide, will d/w EP in AM
   - Monitor Cr

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of ventricular tachycardia (VT). She has a history of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation (AFib) and flutter, and has been taking Gleevec for her CML. She has also been experiencing symptoms of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which are likely contributing to her VT.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 85 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 116/51 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%

The patient's lab results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 87,000 cells/μL
* Hemoglobin: 8.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 133,000 cells/μL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Glucose: 73 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.8 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes:

* CML
* Cardiac arrhythmias, including AFib and flutter
* Type 2 diabetes mellitus
* Chronic kidney disease (CKD)
* Hypothyroidism
* Coronary artery disease (CAD)

The patient's current medications include:

* Gleevec 400mg PO daily
* Metoprolol 25mg PO bid
* Lasix (furosemide) 20mg PO bid
* Irbesartan 75mg PO daily (held due to hypotension)
* Coumadin (warfarin) (held due to unclear reasons)
* Aspirin 81mg PO daily
* Glargine 23mg HS
* Synthroid 0.1mg PO daily

Potential medical complications:

* Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's VT is likely caused by hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which can be treated with potassium and magnesium supplements. However, the patient's history of CML and cardiac arrhythmias increases her risk of VT.
* Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient's CML treatment with Gleevec may cause tumor lysis syndrome, which can lead to cardiac dysrhythmias and other complications.
* Cardiac failure: The patient's history of CKD and CAD increases her risk of cardiac failure, which can be exacerbated by her current hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities.
* Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to her CML treatment increases her risk of infection, which can be life-threatening.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism can exacerbate her cardiac symptoms and increase her risk of cardiac failure.
* DVT: The patient's history of CKD and CAD increases her risk of DVT, which can be life-threatening.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of CKD and CAD increases her risk of pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's history of CKD and CAD increases her risk of respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to monitor her closely for any signs of VT, tumor lysis syndrome, cardiac failure, infection, hypothyroidism, DVT, pulmonary embolism, and respiratory failure. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, which means that she does not want to receive any external interventions beyond shocks, CPR, or intubation if she becomes unstable."

   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Thought to be from hypokalemia in the
   setting of diuresis with lasix. However, pt continued to have v tach
   with stable potassium level.  Discontinuation of dofetalide may also be
   contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome, which
   is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less likely in
   the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal phosphate.
   Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible, however TSH was normal.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately. Patient had another episode last night of
   slow v tach that was not paced out by her PM and required amiodarone +
   lidocaine gtt.
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - Daily tumor lysis labs
   - Continuous telemetry
   - received amiodarone bolus and on lidocaine gtt
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation
   - per heme, should call outpatient hematologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4021**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5900**]) to see
   about starting hydroxyurea if patient refuses Gleevac
   - Continue Gleevec at reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - tumor lysis labs Q daily
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 150mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (renally dosed)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - coumaidn restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Thought to be from hypokalemia in the
   setting of diuresis with lasix. However, pt continued to have v tach
   with stable potassium level.  Discontinuation of dofetalide may also be
   contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome, which
   is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less likely in
   the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal phosphate.
   Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible, however TSH was normal.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately. Patient had another episode last night of
   slow v tach that was not paced out by her PM and required amiodarone +
   lidocaine gtt.
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - Daily tumor lysis labs
   - Continuous telemetry
   - received amiodarone bolus and on lidocaine gtt
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation
   - per heme, should call outpatient hematologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4021**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5900**]) to see
   about starting hydroxyurea if patient refuses Gleevac
   - Continue Gleevec at reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - tumor lysis labs Q daily
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 150mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (renally dosed)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - coumaidn restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)

   ICU Care
   Nutrition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an 87-year-old woman, was initially admitted to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting, and a white count of 173, thought to be due to untreated CML. She was later transferred to the CCU for management of ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has a history of CAD, Afib on dofetilide, CML on Gleevec, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, and hypothyroidism.

The patient experienced two episodes of VT, one on the previous night, which was paced out by her PM, and another episode this morning, which required amiodarone and lidocaine infusion. The patient's electrolyte levels are being closely monitored, and correction is being made as needed.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 86.9, 95.3, 89.6
* Hct: 25.8, 30.0, 30.1
* Plt: 133, 118, 136
* Cr: 1.1, 1.8, 1.7, 1.5, 1.5, 1.6
* Glucose: 73, 132, 119, 95, 131, 117
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 16.0/28.3/1.4, ALT / AST: 44/37, Alk Phos / T Bili: 97/0.8, Differential-Neuts: 71.0 %, Band: 10.0 %, Lymph: 7.0 %, Mono: 3.0 %, Eos: 3.0 %, LDH: 453 IU/L, Ca++: 8.8 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.6 mg/dL, PO4: 4.0 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and plan include:

* Ventricular Tachycardia: Thought to be from hypokalemia in the setting of diuresis with lasix, but patient continued to have VT with stable potassium level. Discontinuation of dofetilide may also be contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome, which is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias.
* CML: Patient's white count is coming down after Gleevec. Not a good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation.
* Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given VT and electrolyte abnormalities.
* Afib/AFlutter: Dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
* CKD: Stable, improved from baseline.
* CAD: No active issues.
* DM: No active issues.
* Hypothyroidism: No active issues. TSH normal.

The patient's goals of care are to remain in the ICU for now, given continued arrhythmia, and to avoid any external interventions beyond ICD shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable. The patient is DNR/DNI.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Tumor lysis syndrome
* Cardiac dysrythmias
* Hypokalemia
* Hyperkalemia
* Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism
* Ischemia/hypoxia/infection
* QT prolongation
* Myopathy
* Diabetic ketoacidosis
* Hypoglycemia
* Hyperglycemia
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Renal failure
* Cardiac failure

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
* Daily tumor lysis labs
* Continuous telemetry
* Received amiodarone bolus and on lidocaine gtt
* Discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide
* Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
* ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating attempts until shock
* EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
* Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP
* Continue Gleevec at reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily
* Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
* Tumor lysis labs Q daily
* BMT recs
* Allopurinol 150mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (renally dosed)
* Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
* Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
* Coumadin restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)
* Continue synthroid
* Monitor Cr
* Continue asa
* No statin due to myopathy
* Glargine 23 HS
* SSI
* Cardiac/diabetic diet
* DVT ppx with pneumoboots for now
* Pain management with acetaminophen
* Bowel regimen with docusate/senna PRN"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of ventricular tachycardia, sustained. The patient has a history of allergies to Percocet, Lisinopril, Zetia, Lipitor, Lovastatin, Doxepin, Boniva, Gleevec, and Ciprofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 103/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is a first-degree AV block.

The patient has received various medications, including Lidocaine, Amiodarone, and other ICU medications. The patient has also received fluids, including IVF, PO, and TF.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, mild thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 133, and elevated liver enzymes with an ALT level of 44 and AST level of 37.

The patient's assessment and plan indicate that they are experiencing ventricular tachycardia, sustained, and have a diagnosis of cancer (malignant neoplasm). The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, due to the sustained ventricular tachycardia.
* Hemorrhagic complications, such as bleeding, due to the patient's thrombocytopenia.
* Hepatic complications, such as liver failure, due to the patient's elevated liver enzymes.
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, due to the patient's cancer diagnosis and potential compromised respiratory function.
* Infection, such as sepsis, due to the patient's compromised immune system and potential bacterial colonization.
* Nutritional complications, such as malnutrition, due to the patient's altered nutritional status and potential gastrointestinal dysfunction.

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to detect any potential complications early and initiate appropriate interventions."

   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Most likely etiology is hypokalemia in the
   setting of diuresis with lasix. Discontinuation of dofetalide may also
   be contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome,
   which is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less
   likely in the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal
   phosphate. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately.
   - Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia stat
   - Recheck K and tumor lysis labs
   - Check TSH
   - If e/o increased tumor lysis will d/w hem/onc re slowing rate of
   chemotherapy
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Amiodarone bolus and drip
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - Lidocaine at bedside in case overdrive pacing fails
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation
   - per heme, should call outpatient hematologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4021**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5900**]) to see
   about starting hydroxyurea if patient refuses Gleevac
   - Continue Gleevec at reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - tumor lysis labs Q daily
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 150mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (renally dosed)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - coumaidn restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # CKD: Stable, improved from baseline.
   - Consider restarting dofetilide, will d/w EP in AM
   - Monitor Cr
   .
   # CAD: No active issues.
   - Continue asa
   - No statin due to myopathy
   .
   # DM: No active issues.
   - Glargine 23 HS
   - SSI
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: No active issues.
   - Continue synthroid
   - Checking TSH
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac/diabetic diet
   .
   # ACCESS: 2 PIVs
   .
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with pneumoboots for now
   -Pain management with acetaminophen
   -Bowel regimen with docusate/senna PRN
   .
   # CODE:  DNR/DNI but ICD to remain active
   .
   # COMM:  HCP is her daughter [**Name (NI) 3353**] [**Name (NI) 12380**]: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12382**].  She DOES
   want her daughter notified regarding this current hospital admission.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Most likely etiology is hypokalemia in the
   setting of diuresis with lasix. Discontinuation of dofetalide may also
   be contributing. Another possibility includes tumor lysis syndrome,
   which is known to cause cardiac dysrythmias. However this is less
   likely in the setting of HYPOkalemia (usually hyperkalemia) and normal
   phosphate. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism possible.
   Ischemia/hypoxia/infection less likely contributors. Per EP, pacer
   functioning appropriately.
   - Correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia stat
   - Recheck K and tumor lysis labs
   - Check TSH
   - If e/o increased tumor lysis will d/w hem/onc re slowing rate of
   chemotherapy
   - Continuous telemetry
   - Amiodarone bolus and drip
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - Lidocaine at bedside in case overdrive pacing fails
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation
   - per heme, should call outpatient hematologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4021**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5900**]) to see
   about starting hydroxyurea if patient refuses Gleevac
   - Continue Gleevec at reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - tumor lysis labs Q daily
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 150mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (renally dosed)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - coumaidn restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # CKD: Stable, improved from baseline.
   - Consider restarting dofetilide, will d/w EP in AM
   - Monitor Cr
   .
   # CAD: No active issues.
   - Continue asa
   - No statin due to myopathy
   .
   # DM: No active issues.
   - Glargine 23 HS
   - SSI
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: No active issues.
   - Continue synthroid
   - Checking TSH
   .
   # FEN: Cardiac/diabetic diet
   .
   # ACCESS: 2 PIVs

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia (VT), chronic systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She is currently in the ICU for management of VT.

The patient's 24-hour events reveal that she experienced VT at 1:30 AM, with a heart rate of 126-128 beats per minute (bpm), and was given an amiodarone bolus and lidocaine drip. She was also given a lidocaine bolus and was over-ride paced back into sinus rhythm.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F (36.9°C), blood pressure of 103/44 mmHg, and heart rate of 85 bpm. Her respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 98%.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but abnormal potassium and magnesium levels. Her creatinine level is 1.7 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 34 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history is significant for cancer (chronic myeloid leukemia, CML), which is currently in remission. She is taking Gleevec (imatinib mesylate) and has been experiencing side effects such as nausea and vomiting.

The patient's medications include dofetilide, metoprolol, and lasix, which may be contributing to her hypokalemia. She is also taking antidiabetic medications, including glargine and insulin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Ventricular tachycardia: The patient's VT may recur, and she may require further management, including cardioversion or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy.
2. Hypokalemia: The patient's hypokalemia may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
3. Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient's CML may lead to tumor lysis syndrome, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias, kidney damage, and other complications.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state may increase her risk of infection, particularly pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's underlying cardiac disease may worsen, leading to heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
6. Renal complications: The patient's CKD may worsen, leading to acute kidney injury or end-stage renal disease.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's nausea and vomiting may worsen, leading to dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.
8. Respiratory complications: The patient's underlying respiratory disease may worsen, leading to respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential complications and improve her outcomes."

   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Etiology unclear although initial
   differential included tumor lysis syndrome, overdiuresis causing
   hypokalemia, discontinueation of dofetilide, hyperthyroidism.  However,
   the patient had another episode of v tach last night despite relatively
   normalized potassium levels making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less
   likely.  TSH was also checked and was normal.  Perhaps D/C of
   dofetilide is contributing. Per EP, pacer functioning appropriately.
   Patient received large dose of amiodarone and on lidocaine gtt after
   episode
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - Daily tumor lysis labs
   - Continuous telemetry
   - received amiodarone bolus and on lidocaine gtt
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Etiology unclear although initial
   differential included tumor lysis syndrome, overdiuresis causing
   hypokalemia, discontinueation of dofetilide, hyperthyroidism.  However,
   the patient had another episode of v tach last night despite relatively
   normalized potassium levels making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less
   likely.  TSH was also checked and was normal.  Perhaps D/C of
   dofetilide is contributing. Per EP, pacer functioning appropriately.
   Patient received large dose of amiodarone and on lidocaine gtt after
   episode
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - Daily tumor lysis labs
   - Continuous telemetry
   - received amiodarone bolus and on lidocaine gtt
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD reset at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating
   attempts until shock
   - EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation
   - per heme, should call outpatient hematologist ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 4021**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5900**]) to see
   about starting hydroxyurea if patient refuses Gleevac
   - Continue Gleevec at reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - tumor lysis labs Q daily
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 150mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (renally dosed)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also held for unclear reasons.
   - coumaidn restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID

   ICU Care
   Nutrition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). She is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for management of ventricular tachycardia (VT).

The patient's recent events include an episode of VT at 12:10 AM, which was asymptomatic and occurred at a pace of 126-128 beats per minute. The electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed a wide QRS complex with a northwest axis, similar to previous episodes. The patient was given an intravenous (IV) amiodarone bolus and lidocaine infusion, which did not resolve the VT. The patient was then overdrive-paced by an electrophysiology (EP) fellow, who successfully converted the VT to sinus rhythm.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 103/44 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 173
* Hemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 136
* Creatinine: 1.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 117 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 140 mEq/L, potassium 4.8 mEq/L, chloride 107 mEq/L

The patient's medical history includes a history of CML, which is being treated with Gleevec. She also has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease.

The patient's medications include:

* Metoprolol 25mg PO BID
* Gleevec 300mg PO daily
* Allopurinol 150mg PO daily
* Prochlorperazine/zofran PRN for nausea
* Coumadin 2mg PO daily
* Synthroid
* Glargine 23 HS
* ASA

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring of electrolytes and correction of abnormalities as needed
* Daily tumor lysis labs
* Continuous telemetry
* Discussion with the EP and hematology/oncology teams regarding restarting dofetilide
* Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
* ICD reset at overdrive pacing at a rate of 128 with 8 escalating attempts until shock
* EP consult closely following and their input is much appreciated

The patient's goals of care have been clarified with her daughter, who is her healthcare proxy. The patient is DNR/DNI and does not want any external interventions beyond ICD shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Tumor lysis syndrome
* Hypokalemia
* Hyperthyroidism
* Discontinuation of dofetilide
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Respiratory failure
* Renal failure
* Infection

The patient's DNR/DNI status and lack of desire for external interventions may impact the management of her condition, particularly in the event of a cardiac arrest or other life-threatening situation."

   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Etiology unclear although initial
   differential included tumor lysis syndrome, overdiuresis causing
   hypokalemia, discontinueation of dofetilide, hyperthyroidism.  However,
   the patient had another episode of v tach last night despite relatively
   normalized potassium levels making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less
   likely.  TSH was also checked and was normal.  Perhaps D/C of
   dofetilide is contributing. Per EP, pacer functioning appropriately. As
   above, last night the patient had v tach that was not paced out by her
   ATP function, so she received a large dose of amiodarone and was put on
   a lidocaine gtt, she was then manually overpaced by the EP fellow.
   - Continuous telemetry
   - stop lidocaine gtt
   - Continue amiodarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide (may defer this
   question to a later date)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD set at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating attempts
   until shock
   - F/U with EP (input is much appreciated)
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation
   - Continue Gleevec at reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - tumor lysis labs Q daily
   - BMT recs

   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily given hyperkalemia and elevated
   creatinine, but will plan to restart
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also was held for unclear reasons.
   - coumadin restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2117-2-15**] 12:10 AM
   - at 1130, patient went into VT at pace of 126-128, asymptomatic with
   blood pressure 110-120/60-70. EKG revealed wide QRS with northwest axis
   nearly identical in morphology to previous night. Patient was given 150
   mg IV amiodorone bolus. Called EP fellow. Remained in VT so lidocaine
   was given (bolus first then drip). EP fellow came and over-ride paced
   her back into sinus rhythm in the 80s.

   Assessment and Plan
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Etiology unclear although initial
   differential included tumor lysis syndrome, overdiuresis causing
   hypokalemia, discontinueation of dofetilide, hyperthyroidism.  However,
   the patient had another episode of v tach last night despite relatively
   normalized potassium levels making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less
   likely.  TSH was also checked and was normal.  Perhaps D/C of
   dofetilide is contributing. Per EP, pacer functioning appropriately. As
   above, last night the patient had v tach that was not paced out by her
   ATP function, so she received a large dose of amiodarone and was put on
   a lidocaine gtt, she was then manually overpaced by the EP fellow.
   - Continuous telemetry
   - stop lidocaine gtt
   - Continue amiodarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide (may defer this
   question to a later date)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD set at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating attempts
   until shock
   - F/U with EP (input is much appreciated)
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation
   - Continue Gleevec at reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - tumor lysis labs Q daily
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 150mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (renally dosed)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily given hyperkalemia and elevated
   creatinine, but will plan to restart
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also was held for unclear reasons.
   - coumadin restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)
   - daily INR
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   .
   # Dysuria:
   - D/C foley and use bedside commode
   - UA and culture
   .
   # CKD: Stable, improved from baseline.
   - Monitor Cr

   # CAD: No active issues.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). She presented to the hospital with vertigo and vomiting, and was initially treated for tumor lysis syndrome. However, she developed ventricular tachycardia (VT) and was transferred to the cardiothoracic unit (CCU) for management.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: temperature 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate 85-126 beats per minute, blood pressure 103/44 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%.
* Cardiac rhythm: first-degree atrioventricular block (AV block) with ventricular tachycardia.
* Laboratory results: white blood cell count 86.9, hemoglobin 10.0 g/dL, platelet count 133, creatinine 1.6 mg/dL, and potassium 4.8 mEq/L.
* Medications: amiodarone 400 mg, lidocaine 1 mg/min, metoprolol 25 mg PO BID, and Gleevec 300 mg PO daily.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

* Tumor lysis syndrome: the patient's white blood cell count is still elevated, and she may be at risk for tumor lysis syndrome, which could lead to acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia.
* Ventricular tachycardia: the patient's VT is ongoing, and she may be at risk for cardiac arrest or sudden death.
* Chronic kidney disease: the patient has chronic kidney disease, and her creatinine level is elevated. She may be at risk for further kidney damage or failure.
* Hyperkalemia: the patient's potassium level is elevated, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias or arrest.
* Hypothyroidism: the patient has hypothyroidism, and her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is normal. She may be at risk for hypothyroidism-related complications, such as myxedema or thyroid crisis.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan should be implemented:

* Continue amiodarone 400 mg and lidocaine 1 mg/min to manage VT.
* Monitor the patient's electrolytes, including potassium, sodium, and magnesium, and correct any abnormalities.
* Consider restarting dofetilide, a medication that was previously held due to renal failure.
* Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust her medications as necessary.
* Consider referring the patient to a nephrologist for further management of her chronic kidney disease.
* Monitor the patient's thyroid function and adjust her thyroid medication as necessary.
* Consider referring the patient to an endocrinologist for further management of her hypothyroidism.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, SUSTAINED
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Etiology unclear although initial
   differential included tumor lysis syndrome, overdiuresis causing
   hypokalemia, discontinueation of dofetilide, hyperthyroidism.  However,
   the patient had another episode of v tach last night despite relatively
   normalized potassium levels making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less
   likely.  TSH was also checked and was normal.  Perhaps D/C of
   dofetilide is contributing. Per EP, pacer functioning appropriately. As
   above, last night the patient had v tach that was not paced out by her
   ATP function, so she received a large dose of amiodarone and was put on
   a lidocaine gtt, she was then manually overpaced by the EP fellow.
   - Continuous telemetry
   - stop lidocaine gtt
   - Continue amiodarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide (may defer this
   question to a later date)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD set at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating attempts
   until shock
   - F/U with EP (input is much appreciated)
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.
   .
   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation
   - Continue Gleevec at reduced dose of 300mg PO Daily (started [**2117-2-9**])
   - Prochlorazapine/zofran PRN nausea
   - tumor lysis labs Q daily
 have been stable
   - BMT recs
   - Allopurinol 150mg PO Daily for tumor lysis PPX (renally dosed)
   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily given hyperkalemia and elevated
   creatinine, but will plan to restart
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also was held for unclear reasons.
   - coumadin restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)
   - daily INR
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best.

   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Etiology unclear although initial
   differential included tumor lysis syndrome, overdiuresis causing
   hypokalemia, discontinueation of dofetilide, hyperthyroidism.  However,
   the patient had another episode of v tach last night despite relatively
   normalized potassium levels making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less
   likely.  TSH was also checked and was normal.  Perhaps D/C of
   dofetilide is contributing. Per EP, pacer functioning appropriately. As
   above, last night the patient had v tach that was not paced out by her
   ATP function, so she received a large dose of amiodarone and was put on
   a lidocaine gtt, she was then manually overpaced by the EP fellow.
   - Continuous telemetry
   - stop lidocaine gtt
   - Continue amiodarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide (may defer this
   question to a later date)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD set at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating attempts
   until shock
   - F/U with EP (input is much appreciated)
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is
   ok with ICD shocks, but does not want any external interventions beyond
   such as shocks, CPR, or intubation, even if she becomes unstable.
   Therefore, she is DNR/DNI.

   # CML: Patient's white count at 87, coming down after Gleevec. Not a
   good candidate for dasafinib given QT prolongation

   - BMT recs

   .
   # Chronic systolic heart failure: Patient appeared slightly
   hypervolemic. Diuresis initially held given v tach and electrolyte
   abnormalities.
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - Hold Irbesartan *NF* 75 mg PO Daily given hyperkalemia and elevated
   creatinine, but will plan to restart
   .
   # AFib/AFlutter: dofetilide initially held because of renal failure. No
   active issues at present. Coumadin also was held for unclear reasons.
   - coumadin restarted at 2 mg q day (reduced dose given on amiodarone)

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of chronic systolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). She was admitted to the ICU for management of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VTach) and was previously transferred from the BMT service. The patient has a history of VTach and has undergone implantation of a pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.6°C, Tcurrent 37.2°C, HR 85 bpm, BP 100/50 mmHg, RR 21 inspirations per minute, SpO2 94%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is being monitored for hemodynamic instability, and her blood pressure is being closely monitored.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,138 mL of fluid over the past 24 hours.
* Electrolyte levels: The patient's potassium levels are normal, but her calcium levels are slightly elevated.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 87,000/μL, and her hemoglobin level is 9.8 g/dL.
* Imaging studies: None have been performed.

The patient's medications include:

* Ceftriaxone for urinary tract infection
* Amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia
* Metoprolol for chronic systolic heart failure
* Gleevec for CML
* Prochlorperazine/zofran for nausea
* Allopurinol for tumor lysis prophylaxis
* Coumadin for atrial fibrillation
* Irbesartan for chronic systolic heart failure
* Aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis
* Glargine for type 2 diabetes mellitus
* Synthroid for hypothyroidism

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Tumor lysis syndrome due to CML
* Electrolyte imbalances due to medications such as amiodarone and metoprolol
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to CML and ventricular tachycardia
* Kidney injury due to chronic kidney disease and medications such as metoprolol and irbesartan
* Respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia
* Infection due to urinary tract infection and CML

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her daughter has been notified regarding this current hospital admission."

   87yo woman with h/o CAD, Afib on dofetalide, h/o v tach s/p PPM/ICD,
   CML on Gleevec but not taking, type 2 diabetes mellitus, CKD, who
   initially presented to the BMT service with vertigo and vomiting on
   [**2117-2-5**], and a white count of 173 thought to be due to untreated CML.
   Now transferred to the CCU for management of v tach.
   .
   # Ventricular Tachycardia: Etiology unclear although initial
   differential included tumor lysis syndrome, overdiuresis causing
   hypokalemia, discontinueation of dofetilide, hyperthyroidism.  However,
   the patient had another episode of v tach last night despite relatively
   normalized potassium levels making tumor lysis or hypokalemia less
   likely.  TSH was also checked and was normal.  Perhaps D/C of
   dofetilide is contributing. Per EP, pacer functioning appropriately. As
   above, last night the patient had v tach that was not paced out by her
   ATP function, so she received a large dose of amiodarone and was put on
   a lidocaine gtt, she was then manually overpaced by the EP fellow.
   - Continuous telemetry
   - stopped lidocaine gtt yesterday
   - Continue amiodarone 400 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue to monitor electrolytes and correct PRN
   - discuss with EP and heme/onc restarting dofetilide (may defer this
   question to a later date)
   - Continue metoprolol 25mg PO BID
   - ICD set at overdrive pacing at rate of 128 with 8 escalating attempts
   until shock
   - F/U with EP (input is much appreciated)
   - Goals of care clarified with patient and HCP [**Name (NI) 3353**] (daughter), pt is

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of chronic diseases, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CML). She was initially admitted to the hospital for vertigo and vomiting, and was later transferred to the ICU for management of ventricular tachycardia (VT).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 100/50 mmHg.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: the patient is receiving continuous telemetry and is being monitored for electrolyte imbalances.
* Respiratory support: the patient is not receiving oxygen therapy, but is being monitored for respiratory status.
* Laboratory results: the patient's white blood cell count is 87,000/μL, and her platelet count is 117,000/μL. Her liver enzymes are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 40 U/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 29 U/L. Her creatinine level is 1.5 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 25 mg/dL.
* Imaging studies: none are mentioned in the note.

The patient's medical history is significant for CML, which is being treated with Gleevec. She has also had a pacemaker inserted and has a history of atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current medications include:

* Gleevec 300mg PO daily
* Metoprolol 25mg PO BID
* Lasix 40mg PO daily
* Irbesartan *NF* 75mg PO daily (held due to hyperkalemia and elevated creatinine)
* Coumadin 2mg PO daily (restarted)
* Amiodarone 400mg PO daily (continued)
* Prochlorperazine/zofran PRN for nausea
* Allopurinol 150mg PO daily for tumor lysis prophylaxis
* Synthroid (thyroid hormone replacement)

The patient's goals of care are to avoid external interventions, including CPR, intubation, and shocks, and to prioritize comfort and palliative care.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Ventricular tachycardia: the patient's VT may persist or worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or other complications.
* Electrolyte imbalances: the patient's electrolyte levels may become abnormal, leading to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications.
* Infection: the patient's white blood cell count is low, which may increase her risk of infection.
* Bleeding: the patient's platelet count is low, which may increase her risk of bleeding.
* Kidney injury: the patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate kidney injury or worsening kidney disease.
* Liver injury: the patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may indicate liver injury or worsening liver disease.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is recommended that she continue to receive close monitoring and management in the ICU, with a focus on maintaining her cardiac and respiratory status, managing her electrolyte imbalances, and preventing infection."
