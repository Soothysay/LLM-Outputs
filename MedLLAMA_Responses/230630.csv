   Assessment and Plan
   88 year old woman with sepsis, likely secondary to health care
   associated/aspiration pneumonia with large left sided pleural effusion.
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt with hypotension, tachycardia suggestive of septic shock.
   Pt's mentation is at baseline. Urine output has been approx 30 cc/hr in
   ED. Labs suggestive of lactic acidosis with an anion gap of 21. Sepsis
   likely due to pneumonia given large pleural effusion, also consider
   UTI/urosepsis. Pt now s/p 3L IVF in ED.
   - Continue norepinephrine with goal MAP>60
   - Bolus with IVF prn to try to wean norepinephrine
   - Broadly culture (blood, urine, sputum)
   - Place a-line to monitor BP's
   - CVP>12
   - Check mixed venous sat, if low consider transfusion if hct<30
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Initially pt was on NRB, was weaned down to 4L
   NC, and is now tolerating room air. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to pneumonia,
   pleural effusion.
   - Check ABG
   - ATC nebs
   - Treat pneumonia with vanc, zosyn
   .
   # Anion-gap acidosis: Pt has an anion gap of 21, with a delta-delta of
   [**10-11**] which suggests a metabolic alkalosis as well. AG acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis and uremia.
   - Continue IVF for elevated lactate
   - ABG as above
   - A line for ABG monitoring
   .
   # Massive left pleural effusion: Likely infectious versus malignant
   pleural effusion. Pt has recently been on a course of levaquin and
   flagyl since [**3-6**] for aspiration pna, which was broadened to vanc and
   zosyn on admission. Given CXR from [**2182-3-4**] that showed a left
   consolidation with pleural effusion, it seems possible that effusion is
   secondary to indection. Pt had mediastinal LN involvement on PET scan,
   so pleural effusion could be related to known metastatic breast cancer.
   - Continue vanc and zosyn
   - US-guided thoracentesis today
   - Consider high-res CT
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension, but also may be a
   component of prerenal renal failure.
   - Check urine lytes
   - Hold ACE and diuretic
   - Renally dose meds.
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia: Perhaps related to acute renal failure.
   - Phosphate today is normal.
   .
   # Htn: Hold home lisinopril, amlodipine and hctz while pt on pressors.
   .
   # H/o CVA: Residual L deficits.
   - Continue statin.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with sepsis, likely secondary to healthcare-associated/aspiration pneumonia with a large left-sided pleural effusion. The patient has a history of breast cancer with mediastinal lymph node involvement, which may be related to the pleural effusion.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tympanic temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate 82 bpm, blood pressure 139/76 mmHg, respiratory rate 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 95% on room air.
* Physical examination: The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. She reports feeling ""lazy."" The lungs are clear, with right rhonchi and left minimal breath sounds. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended, with bowel sounds present.
* Laboratory results: The patient has a white blood cell count of 16.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 399 K/uL. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 24 mEq/L, creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL, and lactate is 1.3 mmol/L.
* Radiology: The patient has a large left-sided pleural effusion, which may be related to the pneumonia.

The patient's potential medical complications are:

* Sepsis: The patient has hypotension, tachycardia, and laboratory evidence of lactic acidosis, suggesting septic shock.
* Respiratory distress: The patient has a large pleural effusion, which may be causing respiratory distress.
* Anion-gap acidosis: The patient has an anion gap of 21, which suggests a metabolic alkalosis as well. The acidosis may be due to lactic acidosis and uremia.
* Massive left pleural effusion: The patient has a large pleural effusion, which may be related to infection or malignant disease.
* Acute renal failure: The patient has a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, which may be due to hypotension or acute tubular necrosis.
* Hyperphosphatemia: The patient has a phosphate level of 3.2 mg/dL, which may be related to acute renal failure.

The plan for the patient includes:

* Continuing norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60 mmHg.
* Bolusing with IV fluids as needed to try to wean norepinephrine.
* Broadly culturing the patient's blood, urine, and sputum.
* Placing an arterial line to monitor blood pressure.
* Checking mixed venous saturation, and transfusing if the hematocrit is less than 30.
* Treating pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.
* Performing a US-guided thoracentesis to drain the pleural effusion.
* Considering a high-resolution CT scan to further evaluate the pleural effusion.
* Holding ACE and diuretic medications.
* Renally dosing medications.
* Repleting electrolytes and monitoring serum glucose levels.
* Continuing statin therapy for the patient's history of CVA."

   # Sepsis: Pt with hypotension, tachycardia suggestive of septic shock.
   Pt's mentation is at baseline. Urine output has been approx 30 cc/hr in
   ED. Labs suggestive of lactic acidosis with an anion gap of 21. Sepsis
   likely due to pneumonia given large pleural effusion, also consider
   UTI/urosepsis. Pt now s/p 3L IVF in ED.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old woman with sepsis, likely secondary to healthcare-associated/aspiration pneumonia with a large left-sided pleural effusion. She has been treated with antibiotics, and a thoracentesis was performed to remove 1400ml of serosanguinous fluid. The patient's respiratory status has improved, and she is tolerating room air. However, she remains at risk for various complications, including septic shock, anion-gap acidosis, acute renal failure, and hyperphosphatemia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and lactic acidosis suggest septic shock, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Anion-gap acidosis: The patient's anion gap of 21 and delta-delta of 10-11 suggest metabolic alkalosis, which can worsen her acidosis and lead to respiratory and cardiac complications.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure, likely caused by hypotension and ATN, can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased mortality.
4. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient's elevated phosphate levels can exacerbate her acute renal failure and lead to cardiac complications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress, likely caused by pneumonia and pleural effusion, can lead to respiratory failure and death.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia can lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of CVA and current sepsis can lead to neurological complications, such as seizures, cerebral edema, and increased intracranial pressure.
8. Infection: The patient's large pleural effusion and respiratory failure increase her risk of developing secondary infections, such as pneumonia and sepsis.
9. Malignancy: The patient's history of breast cancer and mediastinal LN involvement on PET scan suggest that her pleural effusion may be related to metastatic disease, which can lead to further complications and decreased survival.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   88 year old woman with sepsis, likely secondary to health care
   associated/aspiration pneumonia with large left sided pleural effusion
   with exudative
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt with hypotension, tachycardia suggestive of septic shock.
   Pt's mentation is at baseline. Urine output has been approx 30 cc/hr in
   ED. Labs suggestive of lactic acidosis with an anion gap of 21. Sepsis
   likely due to pneumonia given large pleural effusion, also consider
   UTI/urosepsis. Pt now s/p 3L IVF in ED.
   - Continue norepinephrine with goal MAP>60
   - Bolus with IVF prn to try to wean norepinephrine
   - Broadly culture (blood, urine, sputum)
   - Place a-line to monitor BP's
   - CVP>12
   - Check mixed venous sat, if low consider transfusion if hct<30
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Initially pt was on NRB, was weaned down to 4L
   NC, and is now tolerating room air. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to pneumonia,
   pleural effusion.
   - Check ABG
   - ATC nebs
   - Treat pneumonia with Unasyn x 10 day course for aspiration PNA (could
   transition to Augmentin)
   - Continue O2 PRN
   .
   # Anion-gap acidosis: Pt has an anion gap of 21, with a delta-delta of
   [**10-11**] which suggests a metabolic alkalosis as well. AG acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis and uremia.
   - Continue IVF for elevated lactate
   - ABG as above
   - A line for ABG monitoring
   .
   # Massive left pleural effusion: Likely infectious versus malignant
   pleural effusion. Pt has recently been on a course of levaquin and
   flagyl since [**3-6**] for aspiration pna, which was broadened to vanc and
   zosyn on admission. Given CXR from [**2182-3-4**] that showed a left
   consolidation with pleural effusion, it seems possible that effusion is
   secondary to indection. Pt had mediastinal LN involvement on PET scan,
   so pleural effusion could be related to known metastatic breast cancer.
   - Continue Unasyn as above
   - Hold off on draining fluid re-accumulation at this time as pt
   minimally symptomatic; may require repeat tap if sx accelerate (with
   Pleurex catheter placement)
   - Consider high-res CT
   - F/U cytology from initial thoracentesis
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension, but also may be a
   component of prerenal renal failure.
   - Check urine lytes
   - Hold ACE and diuretic

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman with sepsis, likely secondary to healthcare-associated/aspiration pneumonia with a large left-sided pleural effusion. She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), anion-gap acidosis, acute renal failure, and hyperphosphatemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis: Continued hypotension, tachycardia, and organ dysfunction, leading to septic shock and multi-organ failure.
2. ARDS: Progressive respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation and potentially leading to respiratory failure and death.
3. Anion-gap acidosis: Further exacerbation of acidosis, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, and increased mortality.
4. Acute renal failure: Progressive renal failure, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Hyperphosphatemia: Continued elevation of phosphate levels, potentially leading to further nephrotoxicity, cardiac arrhythmias, and increased mortality.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for these conditions, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and respiratory support. However, close monitoring and adjustment of treatment are necessary to prevent or mitigate these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 68-inch tall individual who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute pleural effusion, and alteration in nutrition. Over the past 24 hours, the patient underwent a thoracentesis procedure, which removed 1400ml of serosanguinous fluid from the pleural cavity. The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there was an improvement in their respiratory status.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, blood pressure of 135/72mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 15mmHg, and their fluid balance is -1700ml.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 387 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and their blood glucose level is 83 mg/dL. Other laboratory results include elevated liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), as well as elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pleural effusion and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) increase their risk of developing respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis without organ dysfunction may progress to sepsis with organ dysfunction, leading to organ failure.
3. Infection: The patient's pleural effusion and thoracentesis procedure increase their risk of developing an infection, such as pneumonia or empyema.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) suggest a coagulopathy, which may increase their risk of bleeding.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's alteration in nutrition may lead to malnutrition, which can impair their immune function and increase their risk of developing infections.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's elevated lactate levels and decreased magnesium and potassium levels may lead to an electrolyte imbalance, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
7. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction, which can impair their ability to metabolize medications and increase their risk of bleeding.
8. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate renal dysfunction, which can increase their risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD)."

   Assessment and Plan
   88 year old woman with sepsis, likely secondary to health care
   associated/aspiration pneumonia with large left sided pleural effusion.
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt with hypotension, tachycardia suggestive of septic shock.
   Pt's mentation is at baseline. Urine output has been approx 30 cc/hr in
   ED. Labs suggestive of lactic acidosis with an anion gap of 21. Sepsis
   likely due to pneumonia given large pleural effusion, also consider
   UTI/urosepsis. Pt now s/p 3L IVF in ED.
   - Continue norepinephrine with goal MAP>60
   - Bolus with IVF prn to try to wean norepinephrine
   - Broadly culture (blood, urine, sputum)
   - Place a-line to monitor BP's
   - CVP>12
   - Check mixed venous sat, if low consider transfusion if hct<30
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Initially pt was on NRB, was weaned down to 4L
   NC, and is now tolerating room air. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to pneumonia,
   pleural effusion.
   - Check ABG
   - ATC nebs
   - Treat pneumonia with vanc, zosyn
   .
   # Anion-gap acidosis: Pt has an anion gap of 21, with a delta-delta of
   [**10-11**] which suggests a metabolic alkalosis as well. AG acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis and uremia.
   - Continue IVF for elevated lactate
   - ABG as above
   - A line for ABG monitoring
   .
   # Massive left pleural effusion: Likely infectious versus malignant
   pleural effusion. Pt has recently been on a course of levaquin and
   flagyl since [**3-6**] for aspiration pna, which was broadened to vanc and
   zosyn on admission. Given CXR from [**2182-3-4**] that showed a left
   consolidation with pleural effusion, it seems possible that effusion is
   secondary to indection. Pt had mediastinal LN involvement on PET scan,
   so pleural effusion could be related to known metastatic breast cancer.
   - Continue vanc and zosyn
   - US-guided thoracentesis today
   - Consider high-res CT
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension, but also may be a
   component of prerenal renal failure.
   - Check urine lytes
   - Hold ACE and diuretic
   - Renally dose meds.
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia: Perhaps related to acute renal failure.
   - Phosphate today is normal.
   .
   # Htn: Hold home lisinopril, amlodipine and hctz while pt on pressors.
   .
   # H/o CVA: Residual L deficits.
   - Continue statin.
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, S+S
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin
   # Access: peripherals, CVL
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient); HCP dtr [**Name (NI) 8**]

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with sepsis, likely secondary to healthcare-associated or aspiration pneumonia with a large left-sided pleural effusion. She has been receiving treatment for sepsis, including norepinephrine, IV fluids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. She also has respiratory distress, anion-gap acidosis, massive left pleural effusion, acute renal failure, hyperphosphatemia, and hypertension. Her recent medical history includes aspiration pneumonia and mediastinal lymph node involvement on PET scan, suggesting possible metastatic breast cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may progress to septic shock, leading to further deterioration in her condition.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, requiring increased oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation.
3. Anion-Gap Acidosis: The patient's anion-gap acidosis may lead to further metabolic complications, such as hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, or seizures.
4. Massive Left Pleural Effusion: The patient's massive pleural effusion may continue to worsen, leading to respiratory compromise, cardiac tamponade, or even respiratory arrest.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease, requiring dialysis or further management.
6. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient's hyperphosphatemia may lead to further complications, such as hypocalcemia, cardiac arrhythmias, or soft tissue calcification.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen, leading to further cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac failure, stroke, or hypertensive encephalopathy.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   88 year old woman with sepsis, likely secondary to health care
   associated/aspiration pneumonia with large left sided pleural effusion
   with exudative
   .
   # Sepsis: Pt with hypotension, tachycardia suggestive of septic shock.
   Pt's mentation is at baseline. Urine output has been approx 30 cc/hr in
   ED. Labs suggestive of lactic acidosis with an anion gap of 21. Sepsis
   likely due to pneumonia given large pleural effusion, also consider
   UTI/urosepsis. Pt now s/p 3L IVF in ED.
   - Continue norepinephrine with goal MAP>60
   - Bolus with IVF prn to try to wean norepinephrine
   - Broadly culture (blood, urine, sputum)
   - Place a-line to monitor BP's
   - CVP>12
   - Check mixed venous sat, if low consider transfusion if hct<30
   .
   # Respiratory distress: Initially pt was on NRB, was weaned down to 4L
   NC, and is now tolerating room air. [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to pneumonia,
   pleural effusion.
   - Check ABG
   - ATC nebs
   - Treat pneumonia with vanc, zosyn
   .
   # Anion-gap acidosis: Pt has an anion gap of 21, with a delta-delta of
   [**10-11**] which suggests a metabolic alkalosis as well. AG acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis and uremia.
   - Continue IVF for elevated lactate
   - ABG as above
   - A line for ABG monitoring
   .
   # Massive left pleural effusion: Likely infectious versus malignant
   pleural effusion. Pt has recently been on a course of levaquin and
   flagyl since [**3-6**] for aspiration pna, which was broadened to vanc and
   zosyn on admission. Given CXR from [**2182-3-4**] that showed a left
   consolidation with pleural effusion, it seems possible that effusion is
   secondary to indection. Pt had mediastinal LN involvement on PET scan,
   so pleural effusion could be related to known metastatic breast cancer.
   - Continue vanc and zosyn
   - US-guided thoracentesis today
   - Consider high-res CT
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely ATN due to hypotension, but also may be a
   component of prerenal renal failure.
   - Check urine lytes
   - Hold ACE and diuretic
   - Renally dose meds.
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia: Perhaps related to acute renal failure.
   - Phosphate today is normal.
   .
   # Htn: Hold home lisinopril, amlodipine and hctz while pt on pressors.
   .
   # H/o CVA: Residual L deficits.
   - Continue statin.

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with sepsis, likely secondary to healthcare-associated/aspiration pneumonia with a large left-sided pleural effusion. She has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and has undergone thoracentesis to remove 1400ml of serosanguinous fluid. She is currently on norepinephrine for blood pressure support and has been weaned off the non-rebreather mask to room air.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: She has hypotension, tachycardia, and a high white blood cell count, which are suggestive of septic shock. Her mentation is at baseline, and her urine output is approximately 30cc/hr.
2. Respiratory distress: She has a large pleural effusion and pneumonia, which may be contributing to her respiratory distress.
3. Anion-gap acidosis: She has an anion gap of 21, which suggests a metabolic alkalosis as well as lactic acidosis and uremia.
4. Massive left pleural effusion: This is likely infectious versus malignant, and she has been treated with antibiotics.
5. Acute renal failure: This is likely due to hypotension, but may also be a component of prerenal renal failure.
6. Hyperphosphatemia: This may be related to acute renal failure.
7. Hypertension: She is currently on pressors and has a history of hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or coagulopathy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypertension and hypotension may lead to cardiovascular instability, including arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure progression: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
5. Infection progression: The patient's pneumonia and pleural effusion may worsen, leading to septic shock or death.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of CVA may lead to neurological complications, such as stroke or transient ischemic attack.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's pressors may lead to hemodynamic instability, including hypotension or hypertension."
