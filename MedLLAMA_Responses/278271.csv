   Assessment and Plan: 84 yo woman with h/o CHF, HTN, and polymyositis
   who presents from [**Hospital 858**] Rehab with lower extremity edema and hypoxia,
   transfered to CCU with acutely worsened hypoxia.
   .
   #. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.
   Pt has history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis
   and not CHF.
   - continue on supportive O2 and wean as tolerated
   - will hold further diuresis for now
   - regular albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   - continue Vanc/Levo for now
   - follow up blood and sputum cultures
   - will hold off speech and swall eval given that previous evaluation
   was done recently, unlikely to be different.
   - If remains hypoxic, could consider a right heart cath to evaluate
   filling pressures.
   .
   # Coronaries:  The patient has no history of coronary artery disease,
   and last PMIBI without any defects.  No complaints if chest pain and no
   iscemic changes on EKG.
   .
   # Diastolic Congestive Heart:  Patient with mild diastolic dysfunction
   on last TTE. Presenting with elevated BNP, hypoxia, and lower extremity
   edema.  Patient over 6L since admission, with continued hypoxia.
   Likely some element of heart failure with new AF, with possible
   insufficient lasix dose or poor dietary compliance.
   - will repeat TTE in am
   - hold diuresis for now as feel patient is euvolemic to dry
   - continue beta-blocker
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of ARF.
   - low sodium diet
   .
   #. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ECG on admission demonstrates
   atrial fibrillation, which is a new diagnosis.  She has been in and out
   of AF since admission, and is currently in sinus.  Likely contributing
   to element of acute diastolic heart failure.
   - continue metoprolol, and uptitrate as tolerated
   - already anticoagulated for PEs, and is supertherapeutic at 4.2, so
   will hold.
   .
   #. Hypertension: The patient has a h/o hypertension and had BP 189/86
   on admission. She additionally had elevated blood pressures in setting
   of hypoxia, which was controlled with nitro gtt.  She is currently
   normotensive off nitro.
   - cont metoprolol and CCB
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] with ARF.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Patient with Cr of 1.2 on admission, currently
   1.9 after aggressive diuresis.  Appears euvolemic to try on exam.
   - send urine lytes, no casts on recent UA
   - hold on further diuresis
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   #. Polymyositis: The patient has a h/o polymyositis, for which she
   takes 60 mg prednisone every other day.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and hypoxia. She has a history of chronic heart failure, hypertension, and polymyositis. On admission, she was treated with bipap and nitro drip, which were weaned off overnight. She is currently on 100% facemask oxygen and has a SpO2 of 93%. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 110/56 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished woman with lower extremity edema and stasis dermatitis. Her lungs are clear to auscultation, and her abdomen is soft and non-tender. Her skin is dry, and she has a trace of lower extremity pre-tibial edema.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, mild anemia, and an elevated lactate level. Her cardiac enzymes are within normal limits, and her electrolytes are slightly abnormal.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's hypoxia is likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. She is being treated with supportive oxygen therapy and will be weaned as tolerated. Her diuresis will be held for now, and she will receive regular albuterol and atrovent nebs. She will also continue to receive vancomycin and levothyroxine for now.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is at risk for acute coronary syndrome. She will be monitored for any signs of ischemia or infarction.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is new and is likely contributing to her acute diastolic heart failure. She will continue to receive metoprolol and will be uptitrated as tolerated.

The patient's acute renal failure is likely secondary to her heart failure and will be managed with fluid restriction and diuretic therapy.

The patient's polymyositis will be managed with her current dose of prednisone and prophylactic antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis: The patient's hypoxia may worsen if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Acute coronary syndrome: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and new atrial fibrillation put her at risk for acute coronary syndrome.
3. Acute diastolic heart failure: The patient's atrial fibrillation and mild diastolic dysfunction may worsen her heart failure.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and oliguria may worsen her kidney function if not managed effectively.
5. Infection: The patient's polymyositis and atrial fibrillation may increase her risk of infection.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of polymyositis and atrial fibrillation may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Thromboembolic events: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of polymyositis may increase her risk of thromboembolic events."

   transfered to CCU with acutely worsened hypoxia.
   .
   #. Hypoxia: Differential for patient's hypoxia includes blossoming PNA
   vs. aspiration pneumonitis vs. flash pulmonary edema with dCHF and AF
   vs. PE.  The patient has been significantly diureesed during the course
   of the hospitalization, and on exam appears euvolemic to dry.  Patient
   was not acutly hypertensive during inciting event, and only became
   hypertensive in setting of prolonged hypoxia.  Chest XR without
   evidence of acute pulmonary edema.  Patient currently being treated for
   pneumonia and has been afebrile.  Chest CT shows dependent area of
   nodular opacities which could be consistent with infection vs.
   aspiration.  Patient has a history of severe aspiration on swallow
   study, and overall would feel that this would be most likely
   explanation of patinet's hypoxia and current equally rapid
   improvement.  PE seems less likely given supratherapeutic INR
   throughout hospitalization.
   - continue on supportive O2 and ween as tolerated
   - will hold further diuresis for now
   - regular albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   - will continue antibiotics of vanc/levo/flagyl
   - follow up blood and sputumc cultures
   - will consider repeat S/S eval in AM, but in the interim, will follow
   their previous recommendations.
   - If remains hypoxic, could consider a right heart cath to evaluate
   filling pressures.
   .
   # Coronaries:  The patient has no history of coronary artery disease,
   and last PMIBI without any defects.  No complaints if chest pain and no
   iscemic changes on EKG.
   .
   # Diastolic Congestive Heart:  Patient with mild diastolic dysfunction
   on last TTE. Presenting with elevated BNP, hypoxia, and lower extremity
   edema.  Patient over 6L since admission, with continued hypoxia.
   Likely some element of heart failure with new AF, with possible
   insufficient lasix dose or poor dietary compliance.
   - will repeat TTE in am
   - hold diuresis for now as feel patient is euvolemic to dry
   - continue beta-blocker
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of ARF.

   #. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ECG on admission demonstrates
   atrial fibrillation, which is a new diagnosis.  She has been in and out
   of AF since admission, and is currently in sinus.  Likely contributing
   to element of acute diastolic heart failure.
   - continue metoprolol, and uptitrate as tolerated
   - already anticoagulated for PEs, and is supertherapeutic at 4.2, so
   will hold.
   .
   #. Hypertension: The patient has a h/o hypertension and had BP 189/86
   on admission. She additionally had elevated blood pressures in setting
   of hypoxia, which was controlled with nitro gtt.  She is currently
   normotensive off nitro.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), hypertension, and polymyositis, who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with lower extremity edema and hypoxia. She has been significantly diuresed during her hospitalization and appears euvolemic to dry on examination.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
* Heart rate: 70 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 110/56 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 93%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Sinus rhythm with a cardiac output of 3.5 L/min

The patient's laboratory results are:

* White blood cell count: 15.3 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 33.5%
* Platelet count: 537 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.2 mg/dL
* Glucose: 90 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR 38.8/29.9/4.2, differential-neuts 90.4%, lymph 6.4%, mono 3.0%, eos 0.2%, lactic acid 1.9 mmol/L, Ca++ 9.2 mg/dL, Mg++ 1.9 mg/dL, PO4 4.9 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: Well-dressed, oriented, and cooperative
* Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT): Normal
* Neck: Supple with a jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 8 cm
* Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds with a 2/6 systolic murmur
* Lungs: Diffuse ronchi with slight wheeze, no wet crackles
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, and non-distended
* Extremities: Trace lower extremity pre-tibial edema
* Skin: Lower extremity stasis dermatitis

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis, and she is being treated with antibiotics and supportive oxygen therapy.
* Coronaries: The patient has no history of coronary artery disease and no complaints of chest pain, and her electrocardiogram (ECG) shows no evidence of ischemic changes.
* Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has mild diastolic dysfunction and is being treated with diuretics and beta-blockers.
* Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ECG shows atrial fibrillation, which is a new diagnosis, and she is being treated with anticoagulants and beta-blockers.
* Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension and is being treated with antihypertensive medications.
* Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is being treated with diuretics and antihypertensive medications.
* Polymyositis: The patient has a history of polymyositis and is being treated with prednisone and antibiotics.
* Hypercholesterolemia: The patient has hypercholesterolemia and is being treated with statins.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Pneumonia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis, and she is being treated with antibiotics.
* Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient has a history of severe aspiration on swallow study, and this could be a contributing factor to her hypoxia.
* Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient's chest X-ray shows no evidence of acute pulmonary edema, but this could still be a possibility.
* Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's supratherapeutic INR and history of deep vein thrombosis make pulmonary embolism a possibility, but this is less likely given her other symptoms and laboratory results.
* Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is being treated with diuretics and antihypertensive medications, and she will require close monitoring of her kidney function.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is 90 mg/dL, and she will require close monitoring of her glucose levels to prevent hyperglycemia.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level is 90 mg/dL, and she will require close monitoring of her glucose levels to prevent hypoglycemia.
* Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, and she will require close monitoring of her heart rhythm.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she requires close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and medical treatment to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 84-year-old woman with a history of CHF, HTN, and polymyositis, was transferred to the ICU from the rehabilitation hospital due to worsening hypoxia and respiratory distress. She was previously on bipap and nitro drip, but was weaned off these therapies overnight. This morning, she denies chest pain, shortness of breath, and respiratory distress, and is feeling well without complaints. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 110/56 mmHg.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished female with no signs of respiratory distress, and her lung fields are clear. She has a trace of lower extremity edema and stasis dermatitis.

Laboratory results show mild diastolic dysfunction on TTE, elevated BNP, and hypoxia. Her WBC count is 15.3, Hct is 33.5, and Plt is 537. Her Cr is 2.2, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 50 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are normal, except for a slight elevation in potassium (5.0 mEq/L).

The patient's conditions include:

* Hypoxia: likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis
* Coronaries: no history of coronary artery disease, and last PMIBI showed no defects
* Diastolic Congestive Heart: mild diastolic dysfunction on TTE, elevated BNP, and hypoxia
* Atrial Fibrillation: new diagnosis, currently in sinus rhythm
* Hypertension: controlled with metoprolol and Verapamil
* Acute Renal Failure: Cr of 1.9, appears euvolemic on exam
* Polymyositis: h/o polymyositis, currently taking prednisone 60mg PO qday
* Hypercholesterolemia: cont simvastatin 10mg daily

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Worsening of hypoxia and respiratory distress
* Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation
* Acute kidney injury (AKI) or further decline in renal function
* Infection, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
* Poor wound healing or development of pressure ulcers
* Increased risk of falls due to hypoxia and weakness
* Poor nutritional status due to decreased appetite and inability to eat solid food
* Increased risk of complications due to polymyositis and prednisone therapy"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure, hypertension, and polymyositis who was admitted to the ICU with worsening hypoxia and lower extremity edema. The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and is suspected to have aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure of 105/43 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Her respiratory support consists of nasal cannula oxygen delivery.

The patient's physical examination reveals a supple neck with a jugular venous pressure of 8 cm, and a 2/6 systolic murmur heard at the upper sternal border. Her lungs are clear, with dry crackles at the bases posteriorly. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no signs of ascites or organomegaly.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, BUN, and potassium, indicating acute renal failure. Her electrocardiogram demonstrates atrial fibrillation, and her chest X-ray shows a mild to moderate pneumonitis.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypoxia: secondary to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, which may require continued supportive oxygen therapy and weaning as tolerated.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: new diagnosis, which may contribute to element of acute diastolic heart failure, and may require continuation of metoprolol and uptitration as tolerated.
3. Acute Renal Failure: with creatinine levels of 1.9 mg/dL, indicating a need for close monitoring and potential adjustment of diuretic therapy.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: patient has no history of coronary artery disease, but may require further evaluation to rule out.
5. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: patient has mild diastolic dysfunction on last TTE, and may require further evaluation and treatment.
6. Hypertension: patient has a history of hypertension, and may require continued monitoring and treatment.
7. Polymyositis: patient has a history of polymyositis, and may require continued treatment with prednisone and other medications.
8. Hypercholesterolemia: patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia, and may require continued treatment with simvastatin.
9. Aspiration Pneumonia: patient has a history of aspiration, and may be at risk for further aspiration.
10. Pneumonitis: patient has a mild to moderate pneumonitis, which may require further evaluation and treatment.

The patient's medications include:

* Verapamil 40mg PO q8h
* Metoprolol 50mg TID
* Prednisone 40mg PO qday
* Simvastatin 10mg daily
* Vanc/Levo for pneumonia
* Albuterol/atrovent nebs for bronchodilation
* Lasix for diuresis
* Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued supportive oxygen therapy and weaning as tolerated
* Further evaluation and treatment of atrial fibrillation
* Close monitoring and potential adjustment of diuretic therapy for acute renal failure
* Further evaluation and treatment of diastolic congestive heart failure
* Continued monitoring and treatment of hypertension
* Continued treatment of polymyositis and hypercholesterolemia
* Further evaluation and treatment of aspiration pneumonia and pneumonitis
* Close monitoring and potential adjustment of medications as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo woman with h/o CHF, HTN, and polymyositis who presents from
   [**Hospital 858**] Rehab with lower extremity edema and hypoxia, transferred to CCU
   with acutely worsened hypoxia likely from aspiration pneumonitis.
   #. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.
   Pt has history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis
   and not CHF.  The patient has been informed she needs a PEG tube
   because of her high risk for aspiration when eating, however she
   refuses this intervention and continues to eat.
   - Aspiration precautions.
   - continue on supportive O2 and wean as tolerated
   - will hold further diuresis for now given ARF and recent diuresis.
   - regular albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   - continue Vanc/Levo for now
   - follow up blood and sputum cultures
   - will hold off speech and swall eval given that previous evaluation
   was done recently, unlikely to be different.
   - As a component of her hypoxia may be bronchospasm given her history
   of asthma and her use of a beta-[**Last Name (LF) 770**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] treat with solumedrol 80
   mg IV q8h to see if this improves her hypoxia at all.
   .
   # Coronaries:  The patient has no history of coronary artery disease,
   and last PMIBI without any defects.  No complaints of chest pain and no
   ischemic changes on EKG.
   .
   # Diastolic Congestive Heart:  Patient with mild diastolic dysfunction
   on last TTE. Presenting with elevated BNP, hypoxia, and lower extremity
   edema.  Patient over 6L since admission, with continued hypoxia.
   Likely some element of heart failure with new AF, with possible
   insufficient lasix dose or poor dietary compliance.  TTE yesterday
   showed EF of 55-60% with grade II diastolic dysfunction, mild aortic
   stenosis, and mild pulm art htn.
   - hold diuresis for now as feel patient is euvolemic to dry
   - continue metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].  As the patient has been bradycardic,
   will dc verapamil and start diltiazem 30 mg tid to improve diastolic
   filling.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of ARF.
   - low sodium diet
   #. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ECG on admission demonstrates
   atrial fibrillation, which is a new diagnosis.  She has been in and out
   of AF since admission, and is currently in sinus.  Likely contributing
   to element of acute diastolic heart failure.
   - continue metoprolol, and uptitrate as tolerated
   - already anticoagulated for PEs, INR of 2.8 today, will restart her
   coumadin at a lower dose given levofloxacin.
   #. Hypertension: The patient has a h/o hypertension and had BP 189/86
   on admission. She additionally had elevated blood pressures in setting
   of hypoxia, which was controlled with nitro gtt.  She is currently
   normotensive off nitro.
   - cont metoprolol and change to diltiazem at above.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] with ARF.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Patient with Cr of 1.2 on admission, currently
   2.3 after aggressive diuresis.  Appears euvolemic to try on exam.
   - hold on further diuresis
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   #. Polymyositis: The patient has a h/o polymyositis, for which she
   takes 60 mg prednisone every other day.  Steroids were increased during
   this admission to 60mg PO qday.
   - Solumedrol as above.
   - Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - cont simvastatin 10mg daily
   .  .
   #. FEN:
         Thin liquids and pureed solids
      A. PO intake reclined in chair/bed ~45-60 degrees as able.
      B. Effortful swallow with small bites of food x 2.
      C. [**1-20**] follow-up sips of thin liquid to clear pharyngeal
         residue.
      D. Alternate bites and sips.
      E. Cough after follow-up swallows to clear any penetration.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of chronic heart failure, hypertension, and polymyositis. She was admitted to the ICU with acute worsening of hypoxia, likely due to aspiration pneumonitis. She has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and mild diastolic dysfunction. She is currently on oxygen therapy, and her oxygen saturation is in the 92-95% range. She has been prescribed various medications, including metoprolol, verapamil, and diltiazem, and has been advised to follow a low-sodium diet.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis increases her risk of developing aspiration pneumonia.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxia and bilateral coarse breath sounds may indicate the development of ARDS.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output suggest AKI, which may worsen her overall condition.
4. Heart failure: The patient's mild diastolic dysfunction and elevated BNP levels may indicate the development of heart failure, which could worsen her hypoxia and respiratory status.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's history of polymyositis and recent use of immunosuppressive medications may increase her risk of developing pneumonia.
6. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and recent use of antibiotics may indicate the development of sepsis.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia may indicate an electrolyte imbalance, which could worsen her overall condition.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and bilateral coarse breath sounds may indicate the development of respiratory failure, which could worsen her overall condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue oxygen therapy and monitor the patient's oxygen saturation levels.
2. Administer antibiotics and antifungal medications as needed to prevent and treat potential infections.
3. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medications accordingly to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her oxygen therapy and other medications as needed to prevent respiratory failure.
5. Consider invasive mechanical ventilation if the patient's respiratory status worsens.
6. Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust her diuretic medications accordingly to prevent AKI.
7. Consider consultation with a pulmonologist or intensivist to optimize the patient's respiratory care.
8. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust her medications accordingly to prevent heart failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo woman with h/o CHF, HTN, and polymyositis who presents from
   [**Hospital 858**] Rehab with lower extremity edema and hypoxia, transferred to CCU
   with acutely worsened hypoxia likely from aspiration pneumonitis.
   #. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.
   Pt has history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis
   and not CHF.  The patient has been informed she needs a PEG tube
   because of her high risk for aspiration when eating, however she
   refuses this intervention and continues to eat.  She is persistently
   hypoxic and requiring 6L NC of O2.
   - Aspiration precautions.
   - continue on supportive O2 and wean as tolerated
   - will hold further diuresis for now given ARF and recent diuresis.
   - regular albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   - follow up blood and sputum cultures
   - will hold off speech and swall eval given that previous evaluation
   was done recently, unlikely to be different.
   - wean steroids to Prednisone 60mg PO qday
   - Pulm consult for persistent hypoxia, ?aspiration of foreign body
   (food)
   # Coronaries:  The patient has no history of coronary artery disease,
   and last PMIBI without any defects.  No complaints of chest pain and no
   ischemic changes on EKG.
   # Diastolic Congestive Heart:  Patient with mild diastolic dysfunction
   on last TTE. Presenting with elevated BNP, hypoxia, and lower extremity
   edema.  Patient over 6L since admission, with continued hypoxia.
   Likely some element of heart failure with new AF, with possible
   insufficient lasix dose or poor dietary compliance.  TTE yesterday
   showed EF of 55-60% with grade II diastolic dysfunction, mild aortic
   stenosis, and mild pulm art htn.
   - hold diuresis for now as feel patient is euvolemic to dry
   - decrease Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID for persistent bradycardia
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of ARF.
   - low sodium diet
   #. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ECG on admission demonstrates
   atrial fibrillation, which is a new diagnosis.  She has been in and out
   of AF since admission, and is currently in sinus.  Likely contributing
   to element of acute diastolic heart failure.
   - decrease Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID and continue Diltiazem 30mg PO TID
   - already anticoagulated for PEs, INR of 2.8 today, will restart her
   coumadin at a lower dose given levofloxacin.
   #. Hypertension: The patient has a h/o hypertension and had BP 189/86
   on admission. She additionally had elevated blood pressures in setting
   of hypoxia, which was controlled with nitro gtt.  She is currently
   normotensive.
   - decrease Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID and continue Diltiazem as above.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] with ARF.
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Patient with Cr of 1.2 on admission, rose to
   2.3 and now 1.9.  Appears euvolemic to try on exam.
   - hold on further diuresis
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **]
   #. Polymyositis: The patient has a h/o polymyositis, for which she
   takes 60 mg prednisone every other day.  Steroids were increased to
   Solumedrol 80mg q8 hours.
   - change to Prednisone 60mg PO qday today.
   - Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of CHF, HTN, and polymyositis, who was transferred to the CCU from rehabilitation due to worsening hypoxia likely caused by aspiration pneumonitis. She is currently receiving 6L of oxygen and has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 135/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her physical examination is notable for coarse breath sounds bilaterally, trace lower extremity edema, and stasis dermatitis.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient's hypoxia is likely caused by aspiration pneumonitis, which is a complication of her polymyositis.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, which is contributing to her acute diastolic heart failure.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL.
4. Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient has mild diastolic dysfunction and is likely experiencing some element of heart failure with new atrial fibrillation.
5. Polymyositis: The patient has a history of polymyositis, which is being treated with prednisone.

The patient's laboratory results are notable for:

* White blood cell count: 15.3 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 537 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 28.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 109 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Aspiration precautions
* Supportive oxygen therapy
* Regular albuterol and atrovent nebulizations
* Follow-up blood and sputum cultures
* Weaning of steroids to prednisone 60mg PO qday
* Pulmonary consult for persistent hypoxia and possible aspiration of a foreign body
* Hold on further diuresis due to acute renal failure
* Decrease metoprolol to 25mg PO BID
* Hold [Last Name (un)] in setting of acute renal failure
* Low-sodium diet

The patient's medical team is monitoring her closely for signs of worsening hypoxia, cardiac arrhythmias, and acute kidney injury."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo woman with h/o CHF, HTN, and polymyositis who presents from
   [**Hospital 858**] Rehab with lower extremity edema and hypoxia, transferred to CCU
   with acutely worsened hypoxia likely from aspiration pneumonitis.
   #. Hypoxia: Likely secondary to aspiration pneumonia vs. pneumonitis.
   Pt has history of aspiration and chest CT consistent with pneumonitis
   and not CHF.  The patient has been informed she needs a PEG tube
   because of her high risk for aspiration when eating, however she
   refuses this intervention and continues to eat.
   - Aspiration precautions.
   - continue on supportive O2 and wean as tolerated
   - will hold further diuresis for now given ARF and recent diuresis.
   - regular albuterol/atrovent nebs.
   - continue Vanc/Levo for now
   - follow up blood and sputum cultures
   - will hold off speech and swall eval given that previous evaluation
   was done recently, unlikely to be different.
   - As a component of her hypoxia may be bronchospasm given her history
   of asthma and her use of a beta-[**Last Name (LF) 770**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] treat with solumedrol 80
   mg IV q8h to see if this improves her hypoxia at all
   # Coronaries:  The patient has no history of coronary artery disease,
   and last PMIBI without any defects.  No complaints of chest pain and no
   ischemic changes on EKG.
   # Diastolic Congestive Heart:  Patient with mild diastolic dysfunction
   on last TTE. Presenting with elevated BNP, hypoxia, and lower extremity
   edema.  Patient over 6L since admission, with continued hypoxia.
   Likely some element of heart failure with new AF, with possible
   insufficient lasix dose or poor dietary compliance.  TTE yesterday
   showed EF of 55-60% with grade II diastolic dysfunction, mild aortic
   stenosis, and mild pulm art htn.
   - hold diuresis for now as feel patient is euvolemic to dry
   - continue metoprolol 50 mg [**Hospital1 **].  As the patient has been bradycardic,
   will dc verapamil and start diltiazem 30 mg tid to improve diastolic
   filling.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] in setting of ARF.
   - low sodium diet
   #. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ECG on admission demonstrates
   atrial fibrillation, which is a new diagnosis.  She has been in and out
   of AF since admission, and is currently in sinus.  Likely contributing
   to element of acute diastolic heart failure.
   - continue metoprolol, and uptitrate as tolerated
   - already anticoagulated for PEs, INR of 2.8 today, will restart her
   coumadin at a lower dose given levofloxacin.
   #. Hypertension: The patient has a h/o hypertension and had BP 189/86
   on admission. She additionally had elevated blood pressures in setting
   of hypoxia, which was controlled with nitro gtt.  She is currently
   normotensive off nitro.
   - cont metoprolol and change to diltiazem at above.
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **] with ARF.
   # Acute Renal Failure:  Patient with Cr of 1.2 on admission, currently
   2.3 after aggressive diuresis.  Appears euvolemic to try on exam.
   - hold on further diuresis
   - hold [**Last Name (un) **]
   #. Polymyositis: The patient has a h/o polymyositis, for which she
   takes 60 mg prednisone every other day.  Steroids were increased during
   this admission to 60mg PO qday.
   - Solumedrol as above
   - Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - cont simvastatin 10mg daily
   #. FEN:
         Thin liquids and pureed solids
      A. PO intake reclined in chair/bed ~45-60 degrees as able.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: 84 yo woman with h/o CHF, HTN, and polymyositis who
   presents from [**Hospital 858**] Rehab with lower extremity edema and hypoxia,
   transfered to CCU with acutely worsened hypoxia likely from aspiration
   pneumonitis.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient continued to require 6L of oxygen.  Her prednisone was
   stopped and she was given 80 mg IV solumedrol instead for possible
   bronchospasm from metoprolol.  Her UCx returned with ecoli, but she is
   on levofloxacin so she should be covered for a UTI (her UA from that
   sample was negative anyway so it is likely colonization).  Her
   verapamil was stopped and she was placed on diltiazem 30 mg tid given
   the hypotension she had with verapamil yesterday.  Her vanc was dc'ed
   today as she is unlikely to have a MRSA infection.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of CHF, HTN, and polymyositis who was transferred to the CCU from Rehab due to worsening hypoxia likely caused by aspiration pneumonitis. She has been experiencing lower extremity edema and hypoxia since admission. Her oxygen requirement has increased to 6L, and she is being treated with supportive oxygen, nebulizers, and antibiotics. She has a history of asthma and is being treated with metoprolol, which may be contributing to bronchospasm.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient's worsening hypoxia is likely due to aspiration pneumonitis, which can lead to respiratory failure and death if not managed promptly.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen requirement has increased to 6L, which may indicate acute respiratory failure. This can lead to respiratory arrest and death if not managed promptly.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 2.3, which may indicate acute renal failure. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and death if not managed promptly.
4. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of CHF and is experiencing worsening hypoxia, which may indicate heart failure. This can lead to cardiogenic shock and death if not managed promptly.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, which can lead to heart failure, stroke, and death if not managed promptly.
6. Bronchospasm: The patient's history of asthma and treatment with metoprolol may be contributing to bronchospasm, which can lead to respiratory failure and death if not managed promptly.
7. Infection: The patient has a history of polymyositis and is being treated with antibiotics, which may indicate an underlying infection. This can lead to sepsis and death if not managed promptly.
8. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's diet is restricted due to her condition, which may lead to nutritional deficiencies and worsening of her condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue supportive oxygen therapy and monitor the patient's oxygen saturation levels.
2. Continue antibiotics and monitor the patient's response to treatment.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust diuretic therapy as needed.
4. Continue treatment for atrial fibrillation and monitor the patient's heart rate and rhythm.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust her diet as needed.
7. Consider consulting with a specialist, such as a pulmonologist or cardiologist, to further manage the patient's condition."
