   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the comprehensive Progress Note today by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**] and
   was present for the pertinent portions of the physical examination.   I
   concur with the history, physical, and assessment and plan as outline
   in the admission note.
   History:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**]
s note.  Her cough and dyspnea was improved
   after pericardiocentesis.
   Physical Examination:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**]
s note.  She remains slightly
   tachycardic (90-100s) but has maintained a BP > 100 systolic
   Medical Decision Making:   Ms. [**Known lastname 8662**] is a 47 year old woman who has
   a history of breast cancer twice previously who presents with weight
   loss, peripheral edema, and cough/shortness of breath increasing over
   the last 2 months.  Her condition has worsened more recently with
   increasing cough.   An echocardiogram showed a large pericardial
   effusion with RV collapse.  Pericardiocentesis removed 500 of blood
   fluid consistent with an exudate and right heart catheterization after
   the procedure showed persistent elevations of her right heart pressures
   consistent with an effusive-constrictive etiology.
   Over the past 12 hours, she reports marking improvement in her
   breathing and cough, but the cough does persistent after deep
   inspiration.  She has pericardial pain and we will begin indomethocin
   as the preferred NSAIA.  There has been continue serous drainage from
   the pericardial drain and an echocardiogram has shown a small rim of
   anterior fluid (without diastolic collapse of the RV).   We will
   continue the drain in place until the output is < 50 mm per day.
   Hematology-oncology will be consulted today for recommendations.
   The management has been discussed with the patient and family.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, admitted for management of pericardial effusion. She has been experiencing dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and pleuritic chest pain for one month, with bilateral lower extremity edema for one week. The patient's pericardial effusion was drained in the cath lab, and a drain was placed yesterday, which is currently draining to gravity.

The patient has a number of medical conditions, including:

* Coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors, including hypertension and smoking
* Asthma, with significant wheezing on exam, but improved since yesterday
* Breast cancer, with a history of recurrence, and currently not taking aromatase inhibitor medication
* Depression, with ongoing treatment with trazodone

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count of 7.0 K/uL
* Hct of 48.6%
* Platelet count of 247 K/uL
* Creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose of 122 mg/dL
* Amylase of 11 mg/dL
* Total protein in pericardial fluid of 4.6 g/dL
* Glucose in pericardial fluid of 64 mg/dL
* LDH in pericardial fluid of 2085 U/L

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP)
* Distant heart sounds
* No murmurs or pericardial friction rub
* Decreased frequency of coughing and improved wheezing since yesterday
* Pedal edema 1+ pitting

The patient's plan includes:

* Continued drainage of pericardial effusion until output is <50-100 cc/day
* Avoiding anticoagulants for now
* Indomethacin and percocet for pain control
* Smoking cessation education
* Hold lisinopril for now, with potential restart on discharge
* Culture of sputum and consideration of CAP coverage if spikes or leukocytosis
* Oncology consult for further evaluation and management of breast cancer
* Social work consult for patient's social and emotional needs

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Recurrence of breast cancer
* Complications from pericardial effusion, such as tamponade or constriction
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea and vomiting or constipation
* Psychological complications, such as depression or anxiety

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   # Pericardial effusion: Explains patient's symptoms of DOE, orthopnea,

   patient has distant heart sounds, increased JVP suggestive of

   EKG. Patient currently tachycardiac with stable blood pressure and no
   evidence of cardiogenic shock. Unable to measure accurate pulsus
   paradoxus due to frequent coughing, however most likely elevated. ECHO
   demonstrated large pericardial effusion with right ventricular
   diastolic collapse, consistent with impaired fillling/tamponade
   physiology. Differential for pericardial effusion is broad including
   viral pericarditis, HIV, autoimmune, hypothyroidism however based on
   patient's prior history of breast cancer and recent weight loss is very
   concerning for metastatic malignancy. Viral infection possible with
   patient's history of sore throat and chills. Labs do not demonstrate
   renal or liver disease. No prior history of TB. Weight loss makes
   hypothyroidism less likely. No recent rashes or joint pain to suggest
   autoimmune etiology.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, admitted to the ICU for management of pericardial effusion. She presents with a 1-month history of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, 1-week history of pleuritic chest pain, and 1-day history of bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient has distant heart sounds, increased jugular venous pressure (JVP), and tamponade physiology, suggesting a large pericardial effusion. The differential diagnosis for pericardial effusion is broad, but given the patient's prior history of breast cancer and recent weight loss, metastatic malignancy is a strong possibility.

The patient has been diagnosed with sinus tachycardia and is tachycardic with stable blood pressure. She has no evidence of cardiogenic shock. The patient's labs do not demonstrate renal or liver disease. She has a history of smoking and hypertension, but no prior history of coronary artery disease.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with significant wheezing on exam, and a CXR report of atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right middle lobe. She has a history of asthma and is currently taking outpatient singulair.

The patient's social situation is concerning, as she has missed multiple appointments and is not following up with her oncologist. She is currently living in a rooming house and reports stress at home.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's large pericardial effusion can lead to cardiac tamponade, which can cause decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and even cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with significant wheezing on exam and a CXR report of atelectasis vs early pneumonia. This can lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
3. Infection: The patient's history of sore throat and chills suggests a possible viral infection, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Malignancy: The patient's history of breast cancer and recent weight loss suggest a strong possibility of metastatic malignancy, which can lead to further complications and decreased quality of life.
5. Depression: The patient's history of depression and current stressors at home suggest a high risk of depression and anxiety, which can impact her overall well-being and quality of life.

Based on this information, the patient's treatment plan should include close monitoring of her cardiac and respiratory status, as well as management of her pain and anxiety. Further diagnostic tests, such as cell counts, total protein, LDH, and cytology, should be performed to determine the etiology of the pericardial effusion. The patient's oncologist should be consulted to discuss further treatment options for her breast cancer. Social work consultation should also be obtained to address the patient's social and emotional needs."

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, admitted to the ICU for management of pericardial effusion. She presents with symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, pleuritic chest pain, and bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, increased jugular venous pressure (JVP), and pedal edema. Laboratory results show normal renal and liver function, but the patient's weight loss and effusion suggest a high likelihood of metastatic malignancy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Malignancy-related complications: The patient's breast cancer recurrence may lead to further metastasis, compromising her respiratory and cardiac function.
2. Tamponade physiology: The large pericardial effusion may cause cardiac tamponade, leading to decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and even cardiogenic shock.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's wheezing and atelectasis may progress to pneumonia, exacerbating her respiratory distress.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's CAD risk factors and pleuritic chest pain may increase her risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
5. Infection: The patient's sore throat, chills, and recent weight loss may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen her condition.
6. Dehydration: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating dehydration, which may exacerbate her symptoms.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's poor nutritional status may compromise her immune function and increase her risk of infection.
8. Depression: The patient's history of depression may affect her mental state and overall well-being, potentially impacting her treatment outcomes.
9. Social complications: The patient's living situation and lack of medical follow-up may contribute to her poor health outcomes and increased risk of complications.

Based on these findings, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her pericardial effusion, respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms, and potential infections. The patient's oncologist should be consulted to discuss further treatment options and management of her breast cancer recurrence."

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

Patient Background:

* 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, currently in remission
* Admitted for management of pericardial effusion
* Presents with dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, pleuritic chest pain, and bilateral lower extremity edema

Current Status:

* Pericardial effusion drained in cath lab, with a drain placed yesterday
* Currently draining to gravity, with a plan to continue until output is less than 50-100 cc/day
* Cytology pending to determine if the effusion is exudative or transudative
* Coronary risk factors present, but no history of coronary artery disease (CAD)
* Sinus rhythm, with no history of congestive heart failure
* Significant wheezing on exam, with a possible diagnosis of atelectasis or early pneumonia in the right middle lobe
* Patient has missed multiple appointments and is not following up with her oncologist, with a possible recurrence of breast cancer
* Patient has a history of depression and is taking trazodone 200 mg qhs

Potential Medical Complications:

* Further progression of the pericardial effusion, potentially leading to cardiac tamponade or cardiac arrest
* Development of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
* Increased risk of respiratory failure, particularly if the patient develops pneumonia or atelectasis
* Potential for bleeding complications due to the patient's history of breast cancer and chemotherapy
* Increased risk of depression and anxiety due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and social stressors
* Potential for social and economic difficulties due to the patient's living situation and lack of medical follow-up

Plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's pericardial effusion and adjust treatment as needed
* Consider an oncology consult to determine the best course of treatment for the patient's breast cancer
* Continue to manage the patient's respiratory symptoms, including wheezing and possible pneumonia
* Monitor the patient's mental health and adjust treatment as needed
* Provide social support and resources to help the patient address her living situation and medical follow-up."

   Imaging: [**9-13**] TTE
   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. There is a small pericardial effusion. There
   are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2116-9-12**] (post
   pericardiocentesis), no change.
   [**9-12**] Cardiac cath
   COMMENTS:      1. Resting hemodynamics revealed hemodynamic evidence of
   pericardial tamponade, with equalization of the end-diastolic pressure
   contours.
   2. Pericardial pressure recordings demonstrated equalization of right
   atrial and pericardial pressures.
   3. After removal of 500 mL of dark sanguinous fluid, pericardial
   pressures decreased to < 5 mmHg, although right heart pressures
   remained elevated with PCWP of 18mmHg, RVEDP of 14mmHg, and RA pressure
   of 16mmHg, with a prominant 'Y' descent and square root sign,
   consistent with residual effusive-constrictive picture.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Pericardial effusive constrictive disease.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with bilateral lower
   extremity edema of 1 day duration. One month ago patient began wheezing
   and coughing which was treated with 3 weeks of prednisone and nebs for
   presumed asthma by her pcp, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] symptoms did not improve with
   treatment. Patient also describes progressive shortness of breath with
   exertion (currently can only walk 6 feet) and significant orthopnea
   (sleeps in a chair sitting up) of 1 month duration.  Reports (+) chills
   and sore throat x1month. Rx with 5d Anitbiotics at that time.  Recent
   wt. loss, decrease po intake.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and pleuritic chest pain. She has a pericardial effusion, which was drained in the cath lab, and is currently draining to gravity. The patient has a history of breast cancer and is currently not taking her aromatase inhibitor medication. She has also been experiencing weight loss and decreased appetite.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pericardial effusion: The patient has a pericardial effusion, which is a collection of fluid around the heart. If the effusion is not treated, it can lead to cardiac tamponade, which can cause decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and even death.
2. Cardiac tamponade: The patient has already experienced cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
3. Breast cancer recurrence: The patient's weight loss and effusion suggest that her breast cancer may have recurred. If left untreated, breast cancer can spread to other parts of the body and become life-threatening.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of asthma and is experiencing wheezing on exam. If her respiratory status deteriorates, she may require mechanical ventilation to support her breathing.
5. Sepsis: The patient has a history of chills and sore throat, which could indicate an infection. If left untreated, sepsis can lead to organ failure and death.
6. Thrombosis: The patient is at risk for thrombosis due to her immobility and the presence of a central line. If a thrombus forms, it can lead to pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's decreased appetite and weight loss may indicate malnutrition, which can lead to weakness, fatigue, and impaired wound healing.
8. Depression: The patient is taking trazadone for depression, but her social situation and history of non-adherence to medical care may exacerbate her depression.
9. Social isolation: The patient's social isolation and lack of support may exacerbate her depression and other medical conditions.
10. Inadequate follow-up: The patient has missed multiple appointments and is not following up with her oncologist, which may indicate a lack of understanding about her medical condition and treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and pleuritic chest pain. She has been treated with antibiotics and prednisone for presumed asthma, but her symptoms have not improved.

The patient's current condition is complicated by a pericardial effusion, which was drained in the cath lab and is currently draining to gravity. The effusion is exudative, and cytology is pending. The patient is at high risk for recurrent effusion, and the drain will be discontinued tomorrow.

The patient has a history of CAD risk factors, including hypertension and smoking, but no prior history of CAD. She has also been treated for asthma, which has improved since admission. However, she has a history of missed appointments and has not been following up with her oncologist.

The patient's laboratory results show abnormal values for hemoglobin, platelets, and white blood cells, as well as elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. Her cardiac enzymes are normal, but her troponin level is elevated.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Recurrent pericardial effusion: The patient is at high risk for recurrent effusion due to her underlying condition, and the drain will be discontinued tomorrow.
2. Tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion has caused tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and she may require mechanical ventilation to support her breathing.
4. Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, and she may require treatment for cardiac failure.
5. Infection: The patient's underlying condition and recent antibiotics may increase her risk of infection.
6. Thrombosis: The patient's history of CAD risk factors and recent antibiotics may increase her risk of thrombosis.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continued drainage of the pericardial effusion
2. Monitoring of the patient's cardiac function and respiratory status
3. Treatment of the patient's underlying condition, including antibiotics and prednisone
4. Smoking cessation education
5. Stopping lisinopril
6. Continuing outpatient medications, including albuterol and ipratropium
7. Repeating echo for evaluation of resolution of effusion following drain removal
8. Social work consult to address the patient's social and emotional needs."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema, shortness of breath with exertion, and significant orthopnea. She has been experiencing symptoms of wheezing and coughing for the past month, which were treated with prednisone and nebs for presumed asthma. However, her symptoms did not improve with treatment. She has also reported chills and sore throat for the past month and was treated with 5 days of antibiotics.

The patient has a pericardial effusion that was drained in the cath lab on [**9-12**], and a drain was placed. The fluid analysis showed an exudative effusion, and cytology is pending. The patient is at high risk for recurrent effusion, and the drain will be continued until output decreases.

The patient has a history of CAD risk factors, including hypertension and smoking. She has no prior history of CAD, and her pleuritic chest pain does not support angina or ACS. She is currently not hypertensive and will stop taking lisinopril.

The patient has a history of breast cancer and is in remission, but she has missed multiple appointments and did not follow up with her oncologist. She is currently not taking aromasin, an aromatase inhibitor, and is overdue for a mammogram. The patient's oncologist is no longer at the hospital.

The patient has significant wheezing on exam, but it has since improved. She has a CXR report showing atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right middle lobe, but no evidence of infection and is afebrile. She will continue to receive Albuterol NEBs, Ipratropium NEBs, and Singulair.

The patient has depression and insomnia and will continue to receive trazadone 200 mg qhs.

The patient's social situation is concerning, as she lives in a rooming house and reports stresses at home. She has not followed up with medical care and has multiple missed appointments. A social work consult is recommended.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 90/62 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and her SpO2 is 95%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a total fluid input of 1,800 mL and a total fluid output of 2,655 mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Recurrent pericardial effusion: The patient is at high risk for recurrent effusion due to her breast cancer history and the fact that she has not followed up with her oncologist.
2. Tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion can cause tamponade, which can lead to cardiac compromise and death if left untreated.
3. Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac function is compromised due to the pericardial effusion, and cardiac failure can occur if the effusion is not managed properly.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she has a history of wheezing and coughing, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and atelectasis, and she is at risk for developing an infection if her immune system is compromised.
6. Depression and insomnia: The patient's depression and insomnia can worsen if not managed properly, which can affect her overall well-being and quality of life.
7. Social isolation: The patient's social situation is concerning, and she may be at risk for social isolation if not addressed properly.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications from arising."

   COMMENTS:      1. Resting hemodynamics revealed hemodynamic evidence of
   pericardial tamponade, with equalization of the end-diastolic pressure
   contours.
   2. Pericardial pressure recordings demonstrated equalization of right
   atrial and pericardial pressures.
   3. After removal of 500 mL of dark sanguinous fluid, pericardial
   pressures decreased to < 5 mmHg, although right heart pressures
   remained elevated with PCWP of 18mmHg, RVEDP of 14mmHg, and RA pressure
   of 16mmHg, with a prominant 'Y' descent and square root sign,
   consistent with residual effusive-constrictive picture.

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the comprehensive Progress Note today by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and
   was present for the pertinent portions of the physical examination.   I
   concur with the history, physical, and assessment and plan as outline
   in the admission note.
   History:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
s note.  Her cough and dyspnea was improved this
   morning but she reports paroxysms of coughing through the day which are
   improved with neb treatments.
   Physical Examination:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
s note.  The fluid drainage was
   approximately 200 ccs yesterday but has fallen to < 5 cc over the past
   12 hours.
   Medical Decision Making:   Ms. [**Known lastname 8662**] is a 47 year old woman who has
   a history of breast cancer twice previously who presents with weight
   loss, peripheral edema, and cough/shortness of breath increasing over
   the last 2 months.  Her condition has worsened more recently with
   increasing cough.   An echocardiogram showed a large pericardial
   effusion with RV collapse.  Pericardiocentesis removed 500 of blood
   fluid consistent with an exudate and right heart catheterization after
   the procedure showed persistent elevations of her right heart pressures
   consistent with an effusive-constrictive etiology.
   Over the past 24 hours, her breathing has improved and the amount of
   the fluid removed has diminished substantially to trace amounts.   Her
   chest pain has improved on indomethocin.
   Hematology-oncology has been consulted and we are waiting the results
   of the pericardial fluid cytology.
   The management has been discussed with the patient today and all
   questions have been addressed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   pressures decreased to < 5 mmHg, although right heart pressures
   remained elevated with PCWP of 18mmHg, RVEDP of 14mmHg, and RA pressure
   of 16mmHg, with a prominant 'Y' descent and square root sign,
   consistent with residual effusive-constrictive picture.

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the comprehensive Progress Note today by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] and
   was present for the pertinent portions of the physical examination.   I
   concur with the history, physical, and assessment and plan as outline
   in the admission note.
   History:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
s note.  Her cough and dyspnea was improved this
   morning but she reports paroxysms of coughing through the day which are
   improved with neb treatments.
   Physical Examination:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
s note.  The fluid drainage was
   approximately 200 ccs yesterday but has fallen to < 5 cc over the past
   12 hours.
   Medical Decision Making:   Ms. [**Known lastname 8662**] is a 47 year old woman who has
   a history of breast cancer twice previously who presents with weight
   loss, peripheral edema, and cough/shortness of breath increasing over
   the last 2 months.  Her condition has worsened more recently with
   increasing cough.   An echocardiogram showed a large pericardial
   effusion with RV collapse.  Pericardiocentesis removed 500 of blood
   fluid consistent with an exudate and right heart catheterization after
   the procedure showed persistent elevations of her right heart pressures
   consistent with an effusive-constrictive etiology.
   Over the past 24 hours, her breathing has improved and the amount of
   the fluid removed has diminished substantially to trace amounts.   Her
   chest pain has improved on indomethocin.
   Hematology-oncology has been consulted and we are waiting the results
   of the pericardial fluid cytology.
   The management has been discussed with the patient today and all
   questions have been addressed.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary of Patient's Condition:**

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema, cough, shortness of breath, and weight loss. She has been experiencing these symptoms for the past two months, which have worsened recently. The patient has undergone pericardiocentesis, which removed 500 mL of dark sanguinous fluid, and has been diagnosed with pericardial effusive-constrictive disease. She is currently in the ICU, where she is receiving treatment for her condition.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's pericardial effusive-constrictive disease can lead to cardiac tamponade, which can cause cardiac arrest or sudden death. Additionally, the patient's history of breast cancer and the presence of a pericardial effusion may increase her risk of developing cardiac complications.
2. **Respiratory Complications:** The patient's respiratory symptoms, including cough and shortness of breath, may worsen due to the presence of a pericardial effusion. This can lead to respiratory failure or pneumonia.
3. **Infectious Complications:** The patient's recent antibiotic treatment and the presence of a pericardial effusion may increase her risk of developing an infection, such as pericarditis or endocarditis.
4. **Cancer Recurrence:** The patient's history of breast cancer and the presence of a pericardial effusion may indicate a recurrence of her cancer. This can lead to further complications and worsen her prognosis.
5. **Nutritional Complications:** The patient's history of weight loss and poor appetite may lead to malnutrition, which can worsen her overall health and increase her risk of complications.
6. **Psychological Complications:** The patient's history of depression and insomnia may worsen due to her current condition, leading to increased anxiety and stress.
7. **Social Complications:** The patient's living situation and lack of social support may exacerbate her mental health symptoms and worsen her overall well-being.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Close Monitoring:** The patient should be closely monitored for any changes in her condition, including cardiac, respiratory, and infectious complications.
2. **Optimal Pain Management:** The patient should receive optimal pain management to alleviate her symptoms and improve her quality of life.
3. **Antibiotic Prophylaxis:** The patient should receive antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infections, particularly given her history of antibiotic treatment and the presence of a pericardial effusion.
4. **Cancer Surveillance:** The patient's oncologist should be consulted to discuss her cancer surveillance and treatment options, including imaging studies and cytology.
5. **Nutritional Support:** The patient should receive nutritional support to prevent malnutrition and improve her overall health.
6. **Psychological Support:** The patient should receive psychological support to address her mental health symptoms and improve her overall well-being.
7. **Social Support:** The patient's social situation should be assessed and support provided to improve her overall well-being."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema of 1 day duration, shortness of breath with exertion, and significant orthopnea. She has been treated with antibiotics for presumed asthma, but symptoms did not improve.

The patient has a pericardial effusion that was drained in the cath lab on 9/12, and a drain was placed. The effusion appears to be exudative, and cytology is pending. The patient is at high risk for recurrent effusion, and the drain will be continued until output decreases.

The patient has a history of CAD risk factors, including hypertension and smoking, but no prior history of CAD. She has pleuritic chest pain that does not support angina or ACS. The patient has also been diagnosed with depression and insomnia and is taking trazadone.

The patient's oncologist is no longer at the hospital, and the patient has missed multiple appointments and is not taking her aromatase inhibitor medication as prescribed. The patient's weight loss and effusion suggest breast cancer recurrence, and a CT torso with prep for allergy to iodine is planned.

The patient has also been diagnosed with asthma and has significant wheezing on exam. A CXR reports atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right middle lobe, but no evidence of infection and afebrile.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent pericardial effusion: The patient is at high risk for recurrent effusion, and the drain will be continued until output decreases. If the effusion recurs, it may lead to cardiac tamponade and further complications.
2. Breast cancer recurrence: The patient's weight loss and effusion suggest breast cancer recurrence, which can lead to metastasis and poor prognosis if left untreated.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR reports atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right middle lobe, and if left untreated, it can lead to further complications and increased risk of mortality.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has CAD risk factors, including hypertension and smoking, and may be at risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's shortness of breath with exertion and significant orthopnea may indicate respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications and increased risk of mortality.

Based on the patient's progress note, it is essential to monitor her closely for any signs of complications and adjust treatment accordingly. Further testing, such as a CT torso with prep for allergy to iodine, is planned to evaluate the patient's breast cancer status and rule out any other underlying conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema, progressive shortness of breath, and significant orthopnea. The patient has been experiencing symptoms for one month, including wheezing and coughing, which were treated with prednisone and nebulizers for presumed asthma.

The patient has a pericardial effusion, which was drained in the cath lab, and a drain was placed. The effusion appears to be exudative, and cytology is pending. The patient has a high risk for recurrent effusion and will have the drain removed tomorrow. A repeat echo will be performed tomorrow to evaluate the resolution of the effusion.

The patient has CAD risk factors of hypertension and smoking, but no prior history of CAD. The patient's breast cancer is in remission, but the patient has missed multiple appointments and is not taking her medication as prescribed.

The patient has a history of asthma, which has improved since admission. The patient has also been experiencing symptoms of depression and insomnia, and is being treated with trazodone.

The patient's social situation is concerning, as they live in a rooming house and report stresses at home. The patient has not followed with medical care and has missed multiple appointments.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Recurrent pericardial effusion: The patient has a high risk for recurrent effusion, and the drain will be removed tomorrow. The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of recurrence.
2. Breast cancer recurrence: The patient's breast cancer is in remission, but the patient has missed multiple appointments and is not taking their medication as prescribed. The patient's oncologist is no longer at the hospital, and the patient will need to be referred to a new oncologist.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of asthma and is at risk for pulmonary embolism.
4. Heart failure: The patient has a history of hypertension and smoking, and is at risk for heart failure.
5. Depression and insomnia: The patient is experiencing symptoms of depression and insomnia, and will need to be closely monitored for signs of worsening symptoms.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia, and will need to be closely monitored for signs of infection.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and will require close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Hemoglobin: 15.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 303 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 122 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient is currently receiving the following medications:

* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis)
* Indomethacin (for pain control)
* Percocet (for pain control)
* Albuterol nebulizers (for asthma)
* Ipratropium nebulizers (for asthma)
* Singulair (for asthma)
* Trazodone (for depression and insomnia)

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pericardial tamponade due to the pericardial effusion
* Recurrence of breast cancer
* Respiratory failure due to atelectasis or early pneumonia
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to CAD risk factors
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility
* Stress ulcer due to prolonged NPO status
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and immobility."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema and pericardial effusion. The patient has undergone pericardial drainage and cytology results show adenocarcinoma. The patient's oncologist is no longer at the hospital, and the patient has not been following up with medical care.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 98/71 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 94% and ABG results pending.

The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, no murmurs or pericardial friction rub, and soft abdomen. The patient's extremities show no pitting edema.

Laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.1 K/uL
* Hct: 45.9%
* Plt: 303 K/uL
* Cr: 0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 122 mg/dL
* Ca++: 8.7 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient's fluid analysis shows a pericardial effusion with exudative characteristics and adenocarcinoma on cytology.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continue drain until output decreases
* Avoid anticoagulants while drain is in place
* Continue Indomethacin/Percoect for pain control
* CT torso today with prep for allergy to evaluate recurrence of malignancy as possible etiology of effusion
* Smoking cessation education
* Social Work consult
* Oncology consult

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Recurrence of breast cancer
* Pericardial tamponade
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Respiratory failure
* Infection (pneumonia, sepsis)
* Bleeding complications (thrombocytopenia)
* Renal failure (hyperkalemia, azotemia)
* Cardiovascular complications (myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest)
* Respiratory failure (atelectasis, pneumonia)
* Neurological complications (seizures, stroke)

Based on the patient's history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid balance to prevent potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, currently presenting with bilateral lower extremity edema, pericardial effusion, and significant wheezing on exam. She has a history of CAD risk factors, HTN, and smoking. The patient is currently in the ICU, receiving prophylactic heparin and antibiotics, and is being treated for pain control with Indomethacin and Percocet.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pericardial effusion: The patient's pericardial effusion is exudative and cytology significant for adenocarcinoma, which suggests breast cancer recurrence. Further evaluation with CT torso and oncology consult is recommended.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's CAD risk factors and HTN may increase the risk of cardiovascular events, such as angina or acute coronary syndrome.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's significant wheezing on exam and history of smoking may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or COPD exacerbation.
4. Infection: The patient's pericardial effusion and respiratory symptoms may increase the risk of infection, such as pneumonia or pericarditis.
5. Depression and insomnia: The patient's history of depression and insomnia may worsen during her hospital stay, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary.
6. Social complications: The patient's lack of follow-up with medical care and history of missed appointments may indicate social and psychological issues that need to be addressed.
7. Nutritional complications: The patient's NPO status and history of constipation may indicate nutritional deficiencies or malabsorption.
8. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels may fluctuate during her hospital stay, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to maintain optimal glycemic control.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's pericardial effusion and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Consult with cardiology and oncology to further evaluate the patient's CAD risk factors and breast cancer recurrence.
3. Continue to treat the patient's respiratory symptoms with Albuterol NEBs, Ipratropium NEBs, and Singulair.
4. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust treatment as necessary to maintain optimal glycemic control.
5. Consult with social work to address the patient's social and psychological issues.
6. Consider a nutrition consult to evaluate the patient's nutritional status and provide recommendations for optimal nutrition during her hospital stay."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Likely metastatic disease to pericardial space.  Plan for pericardial
   window.  OK to pull drain today.  Clinical Care time 40 minutes.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer who presented with bilateral lower extremity edema and pericardial effusion. The patient has a significant medical history, including CAD risk factors, smoking, and a history of breast cancer. The patient is currently experiencing symptoms of coughing and wheezing, and has a history of asthma.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including drainage of the pericardial effusion, which revealed adenocarcinoma on cytology. The patient is currently receiving indomethacin and percocet for pain control, and is scheduled for a pericardial window procedure.

The patient's laboratory results show abnormal values for WBC, Hct, and Plt, indicating an inflammatory response. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 98/71 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Metastatic disease progression: Given the patient's history of breast cancer and the presence of adenocarcinoma in the pericardial fluid, there is a high likelihood of metastatic disease progression.
2. Pericardial tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion could lead to cardiac tamponade, which could be life-threatening.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's asthma and COPD could lead to respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's CAD risk factors and history of smoking could lead to cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure.
5. Infection: The patient's pericardial effusion and respiratory symptoms could increase the risk of infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue indomethacin and percocet for pain control.
2. Schedule the patient for a pericardial window procedure.
3. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
4. Consider antibiotic coverage for potential infections.
5. Consult with the patient's oncologist to discuss the cytology results and plan for further treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema, pericardial effusion, and significant wheezing on exam. The patient has undergone drainage of the pericardial effusion and has been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma. She has a history of CAD risk factors, but no prior history of CAD or congestive heart failure. The patient is currently on various medications, including indomethacin, percocet, and heparin, and has been instructed to avoid anticoagulants while the drain is in place.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Tamponade**: The patient has a pericardial effusion and has undergone drainage, but there is still a risk of tamponade due to the continued presence of fluid in the pericardial sac.
2. **Pericardial window**: The patient is scheduled to undergo a pericardial window procedure, which carries risks such as bleeding, infection, and cardiac tamponade.
3. **Cancer recurrence**: The patient's breast cancer has recurred, and there is a risk of further metastasis or progression of the disease.
4. **Pneumonia**: The patient has atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right middle lobe, which could progress to a more severe infection.
5. **Respiratory failure**: The patient has significant wheezing on exam and may be at risk of respiratory failure, particularly if her asthma is not well-controlled.
6. **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)**: The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to her immobility and the presence of a central line.
7. **Vascular access complications**: The patient has multiple lines and drains, which carry risks such as infection, bleeding, and dislodgement.
8. **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: The patient is at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to the use of anticoagulants and the presence of a pericardial effusion.
9. **Cardiac arrhythmias**: The patient has a history of CAD risk factors and is at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, particularly if her heart rhythm is not closely monitored.
10. **Infection**: The patient has multiple lines and drains, which carry risks of infection, particularly if proper infection control measures are not followed."

   # Pericardial effusion: Drain placed on [**9-12**], fluid showed
   adenocarcinoma.  The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after output decreased.
   Pt to go to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for window procedure today.  Pt has been in NSR
   since admission (with occ PVCs).  Fluid overload has improved since
   draining of effusion
   - Continue Indomethacin/percocet for pain control

   last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin
   (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not taking.  We now have
   evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor with pleural effusion

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with bilateral
   lower extremity edema of 1 day duration, found to have pericardial
   effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Drain placed on [**9-12**], fluid showed
   adenocarcinoma.  The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after output decreased.
   Pt to go to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for window procedure today.  Pt has been in NSR
   since admission (with occ PVCs).  Fluid overload has improved since
   draining of effusion
   - Continue Indomethacin/percocet for pain control
   - To CT today, NPO for procedure
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD risk factors of HTN and smoking. Pleuritic chest pain
   does not support angina or ACS. No prior history of CAD.   Lisinopril
   restarted for hypertension yesterday at
 home dose.
   .
   # Breast Cancer: Pt has been non-compliant with onc f/u.  Patient's
   last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin
   (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not taking.  We now have
   evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor with pleural effusion
   showing adenocarinoma and evidence of bony mets to the spine by CT.
   Also concern for malignant pleural effustions.  Appreciate oncology
   consult.
   -will obtain bone scan non-urgently
   -f/u onc recs
   -will add serum LDH, protein on to AM labs to help determine if pleural
   effusion is exudative/transudative.
   .
   # Asthma: Significant wheezing on exam on admission, but has since
   improved. CXR reports atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right
   middle lobe, but no evidence of infection and afebrile.  Also likely
   COPD given smoking history and lung volumes on CXR.
   - Continue Ipratropium NEBs standing; Albuterol NEBs prn
   - Continue outpatient singulair
   - If spikes or has leukocytosis consider CAP coverage, no antibiotics
   for now
   .
   # Depression/Insomnia: Continue outpatient trazadone 200 mg qhs.
   .
   # Constipation: suspect this is the cause of abd discomfort, slight
   tenderness to palpation.  No BM in last several days.  Will up-titrate
   bowel regimen as needed.
   .
   # Social: Patient currently lives in rooming house. Reports stresses at
   home. Has not followed with medical care (multiple do not show
   appointments).  Appreciate SW consult .

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, currently in the ICU due to pericardial effusion, bilateral pleural effusion, and possible malignant pleural effusion. She has been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer and has evidence of bony metastases. She has also been experiencing constipation, and her abdominal discomfort is suspected to be related to this. She has a history of CAD risk factors, including hypertension and smoking, but her pleuritic chest pain does not suggest angina or ACS. She has been non-compliant with oncology follow-up and has not been taking her aromatase inhibitor medication.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's bilateral pleural effusion and possible malignant pleural effusion could lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion could lead to cardiac tamponade if the effusion continues to accumulate and compress the heart.
3. Infection: The patient's pleural effusion and potential malignant pleural effusion could lead to infection if not properly managed.
4. Constipation-related complications: The patient's constipation could lead to complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or abscess formation if not properly managed.
5. Metastatic spread: The patient's metastatic breast cancer could continue to spread to other parts of the body, potentially leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's pericardial effusion and possible cardiac tamponade could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
7. Pneumonia: The patient's atelectasis and potential early pneumonia could lead to pneumonia if not properly managed.
8. Depression and insomnia: The patient's depression and insomnia could lead to decreased quality of life and potentially worsened medical outcomes if not properly managed.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's pericardial effusion has been drained, and she is scheduled for a window procedure today. She will continue to receive indomethacin and percocet for pain control. She will also be continued on Ipratropium NEBs and Albuterol NEBs as needed for asthma management. Her constipation will be managed with an increased bowel regimen as needed. She will also receive a bone scan non-urgently and will be followed up with oncology recommendations. She will have a social worker consult to address her stress and non-compliance with medical care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and cough, as well as a diagnosis of pericarditis. The patient underwent a thoracentesis on the right side, which revealed a large nonhemorrhagic bilateral pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis. A pericardial drain was also inserted, and a CT scan revealed multiple new scattered sclerotic lesions throughout the thoracolumbar spine, which are compatible with osseous metastases.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), a heart rate of 94 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 115/91 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 97% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.0 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 13.3 g/dL, and a platelet count of 322 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated calcium level of 8.9 mg/dL.

The patient's medications include fentanyl for pain management, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and lisinopril for blood pressure control. She is also receiving IV fluids and antibiotics.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

* Pericardial effusion without tamponade
* Constipation (obstipation, fos)
* Ineffective coping
* Pleural effusion, acute
* Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: IV fluids and electrolytes
* Glycemic control: Insulin and glucose monitoring
* Lines: 20-gauge IV line inserted
* Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with heparin sodium
* Stress ulcer: Stress ulcer prophylaxis with sucralfate
* VAP: VAP prophylaxis with heparin sodium

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Cardiac tamponade due to the pericardial effusion
* Respiratory failure due to the pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis
* Infection due to the pericardial drain and thoracentesis
* Bleeding due to the anticoagulant therapy with heparin sodium
* Constipation and obstipation due to the medication and underlying disease
* Pneumonia due to the pleural effusion and respiratory compromise
* Sepsis due to the underlying disease and potential infections."

 47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with bilateral
   lower extremity edema of 1 day duration, found to have pericardial
   effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Drain placed on [**9-12**], fluid showed
   adenocarcinoma.  The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after output decreased.
   Pt to go to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for window procedure today.  Pt has been in NSR
   since admission (with occ PVCs).  Fluid overload has improved since
   draining of effusion
   - Continue Indomethacin/percocet for pain control
   - NPO for procedure today
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD risk factors of HTN and smoking. Pleuritic chest pain
   does not support angina or ACS. No prior history of CAD.   Lisinopril
   restarted for hypertension yesterday at
 home dose.
   .
   # Breast Cancer: Pt has been non-compliant with onc f/u.  Patient's
   last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin
   (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not taking.  We now have
   evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor with pleural effusion
   showing adenocarinoma and evidence of bony mets to the spine by CT.
   Also concern for malignant pleural effustions.  Appreciate oncology
   consult.
   -will obtain bone scan non-urgently
   -f/u onc recs
   -will add serum LDH, protein on to AM labs to help determine if pleural
   effusion is exudative/transudative.
   .
   # Asthma: Significant wheezing on exam on admission, but has since
   improved. CXR reports atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right
   middle lobe, but no evidence of infection and afebrile.  Also likely
   COPD given smoking history and lung volumes on CXR.
   - Continue Ipratropium NEBs standing; Albuterol NEBs prn
   - Continue outpatient singulair
   - If spikes or has leukocytosis consider CAP coverage, no antibiotics
   for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and cough. She was found to have a pericardial effusion, which was drained on [**9-12**], and the fluid showed adenocarcinoma. The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after output decreased. The patient is currently NPO and has been scheduled for a window procedure today. She has a history of hypertension, smoking, and breast cancer, and is currently non-compliant with oncology follow-up. The patient's lung function has improved since draining of the effusion, and she is currently in sinus rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Malignant pleural effusion: The patient's pleural effusion showed adenocarcinoma, and there is concern for malignant pleural effusions. This could lead to respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Bony metastases: The patient has evidence of bony metastases to the spine, which could lead to spinal cord compression and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of smoking and is currently bedridden, which increases her risk of developing a pulmonary embolism.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's lung function is compromised due to the pleural effusion and atelectasis, which could lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of smoking and is currently in the ICU, which increases her risk of developing an infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of hypertension and smoking, which increases her risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
7. Depression and insomnia: The patient has a history of depression and insomnia, which could exacerbate her condition and impact her quality of life.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
 47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with bilateral
   lower extremity edema of 1 day duration, found to have pericardial
   effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Drain placed on [**9-12**], fluid showed
   adenocarcinoma.  The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after output decreased.
   Pt to go to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for window procedure today.  Pt has been in NSR
   since admission (with occ PVCs).  Fluid overload has improved since
   draining of effusion
   - Continue Indomethacin/percocet for pain control
   - To CT today, NPO for procedure
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD risk factors of HTN and smoking. Pleuritic chest pain
   does not support angina or ACS. No prior history of CAD.   Lisinopril
   restarted for hypertension yesterday at
 home dose.
   .
   # Breast Cancer: Pt has been non-compliant with onc f/u.  Patient's
   last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin
   (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not taking.  We now have
   evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor with pleural effusion
   showing adenocarinoma and evidence of bony mets to the spine by CT.
   Also concern for malignant pleural effustions.  Appreciate oncology
   consult.
   -will obtain bone scan non-urgently
   -f/u onc recs
   -will add serum LDH, protein on to AM labs to help determine if pleural
   effusion is exudative/transudative.
   .
   # Asthma: Significant wheezing on exam on admission, but has since
   improved. CXR reports atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right
   middle lobe, but no evidence of infection and afebrile.  Also likely
   COPD given smoking history and lung volumes on CXR.
   - Continue Ipratropium NEBs standing; Albuterol NEBs prn
   - Continue outpatient singulair
   - If spikes or has leukocytosis consider CAP coverage, no antibiotics
   for now
   .
   # Depression/Insomnia: Continue outpatient trazadone 200 mg qhs.
   .
   # Constipation: suspect this is the cause of abd discomfort, slight
   tenderness to palpation.  No BM in last several days.  Will up-titrate
   bowel regimen as needed.
   .
   # Social: Patient currently lives in rooming house. Reports stresses at
   home. Has not followed with medical care (multiple do not show
   appointments).  Appreciate SW consult .

   concur with the history, physical, and assessment and plan as outline
   in the admission note.    My examination today is consistent with the
   documented examination.

s note.  The patient remains weak but her
   appetite is good.

   Medical Decision Making:   Ms. [**Known lastname 8662**] is a 47 year old woman who has
   a history of breast cancer twice previously who presents with weight
   loss, peripheral edema, and cough/shortness of breath increasing over
   the last 2 months.  Her condition has worsened more recently with
   increasing cough.   An echocardiogram showed a large pericardial
   effusion with RV collapse.  Pericardiocentesis removed 500 of blood
   fluid consistent with an exudate and right heart catheterization after
   the procedure showed persistent elevations of her right heart pressures
   consistent with an effusive-constrictive etiology.
   The cytology has shown adenocarcinoma.  She has undergone right
   thoracentesis and the plan today is to perform a pericardial window
   with left thoracostomy drainage.
   The total time of this visit was 40 minutes with over 50% of the time
   spent on coordination of care and discussions with the patient.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema, pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion. The patient has undergone pericardial drainage and right thoracentesis, and is scheduled for a pericardial window procedure with left thoracostomy drainage.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion can continue to accumulate and cause cardiac tamponade, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pleural effusion can cause respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia and acidosis.
3. Infection: The patient's pleural effusion can become infected, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
4. Malignant pleural effusion: The patient's pleural effusion can be malignant, which can spread to other parts of the body and cause further complications.
5. Metastatic spread: The patient's breast cancer can continue to metastasize to other parts of the body, including the lungs, liver, and bones, which can cause further complications.
6. Constipation: The patient's constipation can lead to abdominal discomfort, pain, and potentially even bowel obstruction.
7. Depression and insomnia: The patient's depression and insomnia can worsen her overall mental and physical health, and can affect her ability to recover from her illness.
8. Inadequate pain control: The patient's pain can be inadequately controlled, which can lead to discomfort, distress, and potentially even organ dysfunction.
9. Inadequate nutrition: The patient's inadequate nutrition can lead to malnutrition, which can affect her overall health and recovery.
10. Inadequate glycemic control: The patient's inadequate glycemic control can lead to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, which can cause further complications.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor her and provide aggressive treatment to prevent or manage these complications."

 47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with bilateral
   lower extremity edema of 1 day duration, found to have pericardial
   effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Drain placed on [**9-12**], fluid showed
   adenocarcinoma.  The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after output decreased.
   Pt went to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for window procedure yesterday.  Pt has been in NSR
   since admission (with occ PVCs).  Fluid overload has improved since
   draining of effusion.
   - continue pleural drains for 24-48 hrs per [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   - Continue Indomethacin/dilaudid PO for pain control
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD risk factors of HTN and smoking. Pleuritic chest pain
   does not support angina or ACS. No prior history of CAD.   Lisinopril
   restarted for hypertension at
 home dose.
   .
   # Breast Cancer: Pt has been non-compliant with onc f/u.  Patient's
   last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin
   (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not taking.  We now have
   evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor with pleural effusion

   # Asthma: Significant wheezing on exam on admission, but has since
   improved. CXR reports atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right
   middle lobe, but no evidence of infection and afebrile.  Also likely
   COPD given smoking history and lung volumes on CXR.
   - Continue Ipratropium NEBs standing; Albuterol NEBs prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, presenting with bilateral lower extremity edema and a pericardial effusion. She was found to have adenocarcinoma in the effusion fluid. The patient underwent a pericardial window procedure and talc pleurodesis yesterday. She has been experiencing pain, which is being managed with dilaudid IV and PO. The patient has also been experiencing constipation, which is being treated with a bowel regimen.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, and blood pressure of 86/64 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 92%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance of -540 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral edema, soft and somewhat distended abdomen, and mild pain with palpation throughout. Her lungs are clear, and her heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.8 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 39.3%
* Platelet count: 247 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 130 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 10.7/35.2/0.9, ALT/AST: 16/24, Alk Phos/T Bili: 83/0.3, LDH: 127 IU/L, Ca++/Mg++/PO4: 8.7/2.0/3.1 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Malignant pleural effusions: The patient's pleural effusion showed adenocarcinoma, and there is a concern for malignant pleural effusions.
2. Fluid overload: The patient has a history of fluid overload, and the current fluid balance is -540 mL over the past 24 hours.
3. Constipation: The patient's bowel regimen has been uptitrated, but it has not had an effect. There is a risk of further constipation and potential complications.
4. Depression/insomnia: The patient is taking trazadone 200 mg qhs for depression and insomnia, but there is a risk of further complications if the patient does not follow up with medical care.
5. Social issues: The patient is living in a rooming house and reports stresses at home. There is a risk of further complications if the patient does not follow up with medical care and social support.

Recommendations:

1. Continue pleural drains for 24-48 hours per doctor's recommendations.
2. Continue Indomethacin/dilaudid PO for pain control.
3. Uptitrate bowel regimen as needed to achieve a bowel movement.
4. Continue outpatient Singulair for asthma.
5. Consider a bone scan non-urgently to evaluate the patient's bone metastases.
6. Obtain a consult with oncology to discuss further treatment options.
7. Consider a social worker consult to address the patient's social issues."

 47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with bilateral
   lower extremity edema of 1 day duration, found to have pericardial
   effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Drain placed on [**9-12**], fluid showed
   adenocarcinoma.  The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after output decreased.
   Pt went to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for window procedure yesterday.  Pt has been in NSR
   since admission (with occ PVCs).  Fluid overload has improved since
   draining of effusion.
   - continue pleural drains for 24-48 hrs per [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   - Continue Indomethacin/percocet for pain control
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD risk factors of HTN and smoking. Pleuritic chest pain
   does not support angina or ACS. No prior history of CAD.   Lisinopril
   restarted for hypertension at
 home dose.
   .
   # Breast Cancer: Pt has been non-compliant with onc f/u.  Patient's
   last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin
   (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not taking.  We now have
   evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor with pleural effusion
   showing adenocarinoma and evidence of bony mets to the spine by CT.
   Also concern for malignant pleural effustions.  Appreciate oncology
   consult.
   -will obtain bone scan non-urgently

   .
   # Asthma: Significant wheezing on exam on admission, but has since
   improved. CXR reports atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right
   middle lobe, but no evidence of infection and afebrile.  Also likely
   COPD given smoking history and lung volumes on CXR.
   - Continue Ipratropium NEBs standing; Albuterol NEBs prn
   - Continue outpatient singulair
   - If spikes or has leukocytosis consider CAP coverage, no antibiotics
   for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema and pericardial effusion. She has been admitted to the ICU for management of her condition. The patient has undergone a pericardial window procedure and talc pleurodesis, and has been started on a bowel regimen to manage constipation. She has also been prescribed pain medication and has had her pleural drains placed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 109 bpm, and blood pressure of 86/64 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 92%. Her physical examination is notable for bilateral lower extremity edema, and her labs show evidence of fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and she has a history of asthma and COPD. She may be at risk for respiratory failure if her condition worsens.
2. Cardiac tamponade: The patient has a history of pericardial effusion, which can lead to cardiac tamponade if the fluid accumulates further.
3. Malignant pleural effusion: The patient has a history of breast cancer and has developed a pleural effusion with adenocarcinoma. She may be at risk for malignant pleural effusion if the cancer spreads to her lungs.
4. Bony metastases: The patient has evidence of bony metastases to the spine on CT scan. She may be at risk for further bone damage and pain if left untreated.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of atelectasis and early pneumonia in the right middle lobe, and may be at risk for further infection if her condition worsens.
6. Constipation: The patient has a bowel regimen in place, but may be at risk for further constipation if the regimen is not effective.
7. Depression and insomnia: The patient has a history of depression and insomnia, and may be at risk for further psychological distress if left untreated.
8. Social issues: The patient lives in a rooming house and has a history of non-compliance with medical care. She may be at risk for further social issues if left untreated.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications and improve her overall condition."

Summary:

The patient is a 60-inch tall individual who has been admitted to the ICU with a pericardial window and talc pleurodesis. They have been experiencing pain, which has been managed with Dilaudid IV and later switched to PO medication. The patient has also been experiencing constipation, which has been treated with an increased bowel regimen. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 109 bpm, blood pressure of 86/64 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 92% and their heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.0 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 13.2 g/dL, and a platelet count of 247 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL, and their glucose level is 122 mg/dL. The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 24 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 16 IU/L.

The patient's diagnosis includes pericardial effusion without tamponade, constipation, ineffective coping, pleural effusion, acute pain, and chronic pain. The patient's treatment plan includes ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's pericardial effusion without tamponade is a potential risk factor for cardiac tamponade, which can lead to cardiac arrest if not managed promptly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pleural effusion and acute pain can lead to respiratory failure if not managed effectively.
3. Sepsis: The patient's constipation and ineffective coping can increase the risk of sepsis, particularly if the patient's gut is compromised.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's constipation and pain can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly if the patient is taking anticoagulant medications.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's pleural effusion and acute pain can increase the risk of pneumonia, particularly if the patient is not receiving adequate respiratory support.
6. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's immobilization and pain can increase the risk of VTE, particularly if the patient is not receiving adequate prophylaxis.
7. Wound infection: The patient's pericardial window and talc pleurodesis can increase the risk of wound infection, particularly if the patient's wound is not properly managed.
8. Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury: The patient's sepsis can lead to acute kidney injury, particularly if the patient's kidney function is compromised.
9. Gastrointestinal perforation: The patient's constipation and pain can increase the risk of gastrointestinal perforation, particularly if the patient is not receiving adequate medical management."

   Assessment and Plan
 47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with bilateral
   lower extremity edema of 1 day duration, found to have pericardial
   effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Drain placed on [**9-12**], fluid showed
   adenocarcinoma.  The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after output decreased.
   Pt went to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for window procedure yesterday.  Pt has been in NSR
   since admission (with occ PVCs).  Fluid overload has improved since
   draining of effusion.
   - continue pleural drains for 24-48 hrs per [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   - Continue Indomethacin/dilaudid PO for pain control
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD risk factors of HTN and smoking. Pleuritic chest pain
   does not support angina or ACS. No prior history of CAD.   Lisinopril
   restarted for hypertension at
 home dose.
   .
   # Breast Cancer: Pt has been non-compliant with onc f/u.  Patient's
   last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin
   (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not taking.  We now have
   evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor with pleural effusion
   showing adenocarinoma and evidence of bony mets to the spine by CT.
   Also concern for malignant pleural effustions.  Appreciate oncology
   consult.
   -will obtain bone scan non-urgently
   -f/u onc recs
   .
   # Asthma: Significant wheezing on exam on admission, but has since
   improved. CXR reports atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right
   middle lobe, but no evidence of infection and afebrile.  Also likely
   COPD given smoking history and lung volumes on CXR.
   - Continue Ipratropium NEBs standing; Albuterol NEBs prn
   - Continue outpatient singulair
   - If spikes or has leukocytosis consider CAP coverage, no antibiotics
   for now
   .
   # Depression/Insomnia: Continue outpatient trazadone 200 mg qhs.
   .
   # Constipation: bowel regimen uptitrated yesterday without effect.
   Will continue to to titrate to BM.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: rising k, ? tumor lysis, will re-check K this
   afternoon.
   .
   # Social: Patient currently lives in rooming house. Reports stresses at
   home. Has not followed with medical care (multiple do not show
   appointments).  Appreciate SW consult.  Will f/u with social work
   today.

   Pt went to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for window procedure yesterday.  Pt has been in NSR
   since admission (with occ PVCs).  Fluid overload has improved since
   draining of effusion.
   - continue pleural drains for 24-48 hrs per [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   - Continue Indomethacin/dilaudid PO for pain control

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, who presented with bilateral lower extremity edema and was found to have a pericardial effusion. The effusion was drained, and the patient underwent a window procedure yesterday. The patient has been experiencing pain, which is being managed with indomethacin and dilaudid. The patient has also been experiencing constipation, which has been treated with an increased bowel regimen. The patient's laboratory results show signs of hyperkalemia, which is being monitored. The patient's social situation is concerning, as they have not followed up with medical care and are experiencing stress at home.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Malignant pleural effusion: The patient's pleural effusion showed adenocarcinoma, which increases the risk of malignant pleural effusion.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's rising potassium levels are a concern, and tumor lysis may be a contributing factor.
3. Constipation: The patient's constipation is a potential complication of the bowel regimen, and titrating the dose may be necessary.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of smoking and COPD increases the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's pericardial effusion and history of breast cancer increase the risk of cardiac complications.
6. Infection: The patient's history of smoking and COPD increases the risk of infection, particularly pneumonia.
7. Depression and insomnia: The patient's history of depression and insomnia may worsen if not managed appropriately.
8. Social isolation: The patient's social situation is concerning, and social work consultation may be necessary to address their social isolation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's potassium levels and consider re-checking this afternoon.
2. Titrate the bowel regimen to achieve a bowel movement.
3. Continue to manage the patient's pain with indomethacin and dilaudid.
4. Consider ordering a bone scan to assess the extent of the patient's metastatic disease.
5. Consult with oncology to discuss the patient's treatment options and management of their breast cancer.
6. Consider ordering a stress test to assess the patient's cardiac function.
7. Consult with social work to address the patient's social isolation and provide support.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider ordering a CXR to assess for signs of pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
 47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with bilateral
   lower extremity edema of 1 day duration, found to have pericardial
   effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Drain placed on [**9-12**], fluid showed
   adenocarcinoma.  The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after output decreased.
   Pt to go to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for window procedure today.  Pt has been in NSR
   since admission (with occ PVCs).  Fluid overload has improved since
   draining of effusion
   - Continue Indomethacin/percocet for pain control
   - To CT today, NPO for procedure
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD risk factors of HTN and smoking. Pleuritic chest pain
   does not support angina or ACS. No prior history of CAD.   Lisinopril
   restarted for hypertension yesterday at
 home dose.
   .
   # Breast Cancer: Pt has been non-compliant with onc f/u.  Patient's
   last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin
   (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not taking.  We now have
   evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor with pleural effusion
   showing adenocarinoma and evidence of bony mets to the spine by CT.
   Also concern for malignant pleural effustions.  Appreciate oncology
   consult.
   -will obtain bone scan non-urgently
   -f/u onc recs
   -will add serum LDH, protein on to AM labs to help determine if pleural
   effusion is exudative/transudative.
   .
   # Asthma: Significant wheezing on exam on admission, but has since
   improved. CXR reports atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right
   middle lobe, but no evidence of infection and afebrile.  Also likely
   COPD given smoking history and lung volumes on CXR.
   - Continue Ipratropium NEBs standing; Albuterol NEBs prn
   - Continue outpatient singulair
   - If spikes or has leukocytosis consider CAP coverage, no antibiotics
   for now
   .
   # Depression/Insomnia: Continue outpatient trazadone 200 mg qhs.
   .
   # Constipation: suspect this is the cause of abd discomfort, slight
   tenderness to palpation.  No BM in last several days.  Will up-titrate
   bowel regimen as needed.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema and a pericardial effusion. She has been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma and has evidence of metastatic spread to the spine and pleural effusion. The patient has been non-compliant with oncological follow-up and is not taking her prescribed medication, Aromasin.

The patient has been in the ICU for several days, and her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 109 bpm, and blood pressure of 86/64 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 92%. She has a pericardial window and talc pleurodesis, and is receiving pain management with Dilaudid IV and PO.

The patient has a number of medical complications, including:

* Pericardial effusion with adenocarcinoma
* Malignant pleural effusion
* Bone metastases to the spine
* Potential for fluid overload
* Constipation
* Asthma/COPD
* Depression/insomnia
* Potential for stress ulcer and VAP

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.0-8.8 K/uL
* Hct: 39.3-48.6%
* Plt: 247-265
* Cr: 0.7-0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 112-130 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, LDH, Ca++/Mg++/PO4

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the comprehensive Progress Note today by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**].  I
   concur with the history, physical, and assessment and plan as outline
   in the admission note.    My examination today is consistent with the
   documented examination.
   History:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**]
s note.  The patient remains weak but her
   appetite is good.
   Physical Examination:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**]
s note.
   Medical Decision Making:   Ms. [**Known lastname 8662**] is a 47 year old woman who has
   a history of breast cancer twice previously who presents with weight
   loss, peripheral edema, and cough/shortness of breath increasing over
   the last 2 months.  Her condition has worsened more recently with
   increasing cough.   An echocardiogram showed a large pericardial
   effusion with RV collapse.  Pericardiocentesis removed 500 of blood
   fluid consistent with an exudate and right heart catheterization after
   the procedure showed persistent elevations of her right heart pressures
   consistent with an effusive-constrictive etiology.
   The cytology has shown adenocarcinoma.
   She underwent a pericardial window with talc infiltration of the left
   pleural space.  She now has two chest tubes in place with active
   drainage.  Will continue with CT in place today.   She will remain in
   the CCU until the chest tubes have been removed.
   The total time of this visit was 40 minutes with over 50% of the time
   spent on coordination of care and discussions with the patient.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with bilateral
   lower extremity edema of 1 day duration, found to have pericardial
   effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Drain placed on [**9-12**], fluid showed
   adenocarcinoma.  The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after output decreased.
   Pt went to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for window procedure yesterday.  Pt has been in NSR
   since admission (with occ PVCs).  Fluid overload has improved since
   draining of effusion.
   - continue pleural drains for 24-48 hrs per [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   - Continue Indomethacin/dilaudid PO for pain control
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD risk factors of HTN and smoking. Pleuritic chest pain
   does not support angina or ACS. No prior history of CAD.   Lisinopril
   restarted for hypertension at
 home dose.
   .
   # Breast Cancer: Pt has been non-compliant with onc f/u.  Patient's
   last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin
   (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not taking.  We now have
   evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor with pleural effusion
   showing adenocarinoma and evidence of bony mets to the spine by CT.
   Also concern for malignant pleural effustions.  Appreciate oncology
   consult.

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the comprehensive Progress Note today by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**].  I
   concur with the history, physical, and assessment and plan as outline
   in the admission note.    My examination today is consistent with the
   documented examination.
   History:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**]
s note.  The patient remains weak but her
   appetite is good.
   Physical Examination:   Per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 3099**]
s note.
   Medical Decision Making:   Ms. [**Known lastname 8662**] is a 47 year old woman who has
   a history of breast cancer twice previously who presents with weight
   loss, peripheral edema, and cough/shortness of breath increasing over
   the last 2 months.  Her condition has worsened more recently with
   increasing cough.   An echocardiogram showed a large pericardial
   effusion with RV collapse.  Pericardiocentesis removed 500 of blood
   fluid consistent with an exudate and right heart catheterization after
   the procedure showed persistent elevations of her right heart pressures
   consistent with an effusive-constrictive etiology.
   The cytology has shown adenocarcinoma.
   She underwent a pericardial window with talc infiltration of the left
   pleural space.  She now has two chest tubes in place with active
   drainage.  Will continue with CT in place today.   She will remain in
   the CCU until the chest tubes have been removed.
   The total time of this visit was 40 minutes with over 50% of the time
   spent on coordination of care and discussions with the patient.

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer who presented with bilateral lower extremity edema and was found to have a pericardial effusion. She was initially treated with a pericardial window with talc infiltration of the left pleural space and had two chest tubes placed for drainage. The patient's condition has improved since the drainage, and she is currently in the CCU with a plan to continue pleural drains for 24-48 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Malignant pleural effusion: The patient has a history of breast cancer and has been diagnosed with adenocarcinoma in the pericardial fluid. There is a risk of malignant pleural effusion, which could worsen her respiratory status.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and has been experiencing shortness of breath and cough. She may be at risk for respiratory failure, especially if her pleural effusion worsens.
3. Cardiac tamponade: The patient has a pericardial effusion, which could worsen and lead to cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and has been experiencing shortness of breath and cough. She may be at risk for infection, especially if her pleural effusion becomes infected.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels have been rising, and there is a risk of hyperkalemia, which could worsen her cardiac status.
6. Constipation: The patient has been experiencing constipation, which could worsen her overall condition if not managed properly.
7. Depression and insomnia: The patient has a history of depression and insomnia, which could worsen her mental health if not managed properly.
8. Social issues: The patient has a history of non-compliance with medical care and has not followed up with appointments. She may be at risk for social issues, such as homelessness, if not addressed.

Overall, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including malignant pleural effusion, respiratory failure, cardiac tamponade, infection, hyperkalemia, constipation, depression and insomnia, and social issues. It is essential to closely monitor her condition and manage her symptoms to prevent these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, presenting with bilateral lower extremity edema, pericardial effusion, and evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor with pleural effusion showing adenocarcinoma and evidence of bony mets to the spine by CT.

The patient has been in the ICU for several days, with a pericardial effusion drain placed on 9/12 and removed on 9/17. The patient has been experiencing fluid overload, which has improved since the drain was removed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 86/59 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium and has a central line in place.

The patient has a number of laboratory abnormalities, including hyperkalemia, with a potassium level of 4.4 mEq/L. The patient's white blood cell count has been fluctuating, with a highest value of 9.5 K/uL.

The patient has a number of medical conditions, including breast cancer, pericardial effusion, and evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor. The patient is also experiencing fluid overload, hyperkalemia, and constipation.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing pleural drains for 24-48 hours, restarting lisinopril for hypertension, and obtaining a bone scan non-urgently. The patient will also continue to receive indomethacin and dilaudid for pain control, and will be followed up with oncology and social work.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Malignant pleural effusions
* Bony mets to the spine
* Pericardial tamponade
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Respiratory failure
* Infection
* Sepsis
* Hyperkalemia
* Hypokalemia
* Constipation
* Bowel obstruction

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care as necessary to prevent these complications and ensure the patient's comfort and safety."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, who presents with bilateral lower extremity edema of 1 day duration and a pericardial effusion cytology significant for adenocarcinoma with metastasis to her L-spine. The patient has been non-compliant with oncological follow-up appointments and has not been taking her prescribed medication, Aromasin. She has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of pericardial effusion and has undergone a drain placement and subsequent removal. The patient's condition has improved since the draining of the effusion, and she has been experiencing chest pain, which is managed with indomethacin and dilaudid. The patient also has a history of asthma, hypertension, and smoking, and has been diagnosed with COPD. She has been experiencing hyperkalemia, which has been resolved, and has had high blood sugars, which will be monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD and asthma puts her at risk for respiratory failure, especially with the presence of atelectasis and early pneumonia in the right middle lobe.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's pericardial effusion and metastatic breast cancer to the spine increase her risk for cardiac complications, such as cardiac tamponade, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
3. Infection: The patient's history of smoking and COPD increases her risk for respiratory infections, and the presence of atelectasis and early pneumonia in the right middle lobe suggests that she may be at risk for infection.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's history of hyperkalemia and the presence of metastatic breast cancer to the spine increase her risk for hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.
5. Anemia: The patient's history of breast cancer and metastasis to the spine increases her risk for anemia, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased immune function.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's history of breast cancer and metastasis to the spine increases her risk for malnutrition, which can lead to weight loss, fatigue, and decreased immune function.
7. Depression: The patient's history of breast cancer and metastasis to the spine increases her risk for depression, which can lead to decreased quality of life, anxiety, and decreased immune function.
8. Anxiety: The patient's history of breast cancer and metastasis to the spine increases her risk for anxiety, which can lead to decreased quality of life, insomnia, and decreased immune function.
9. Constipation: The patient's history of breast cancer and metastasis to the spine increases her risk for constipation, which can lead to decreased quality of life, abdominal pain, and decreased immune function.
10. Social complications: The patient's history of living in a rooming house and experiencing stress at home increases her risk for social complications, such as decreased social support, decreased quality of life, and increased risk for depression and anxiety."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 47 year old female PMH breast cancer who presents with bilateral
   lower extremity edema of 1 day duration, found to have pericardial
   effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: Drain placed on [**9-12**], fluid showed
   adenocarcinoma.  The drain was pulled on [**9-17**] after output decreased.
   Pt went to CT [**Doctor First Name **] for window procedure yesterday.  Pt has been in NSR
   since admission (with occ PVCs).  Fluid overload has improved since
   draining of effusion.
   - continue pleural drains for 24-48 hrs per [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   - Continue Indomethacin/dilaudid PO for pain control
   .
   # CORONARIES: CAD risk factors of HTN and smoking. Pleuritic chest pain
   does not support angina or ACS. No prior history of CAD.   Lisinopril
   restarted for hypertension at
 home dose.
   .
   # Breast Cancer: Pt has been non-compliant with onc f/u.  Patient's
   last appointment [**2115-1-30**] reports she is to continue Aromasin
   (aromotase inhibitor) which she is currently not taking.  We now have
   evidence of metastatic spread of her tumor with pleural effusion
   showing adenocarinoma and evidence of bony mets to the spine by CT.
   Also concern for malignant pleural effustions.  Appreciate oncology
   consult.
   -will obtain bone scan non-urgently
   -f/u onc recs
   .
   # Asthma: Significant wheezing on exam on admission, but has since
   improved. CXR reports atelectasis vs early pneumonia in the right
   middle lobe, but no evidence of infection and afebrile.  Also likely
   COPD given smoking history and lung volumes on CXR.
   - Continue Ipratropium NEBs standing; Albuterol NEBs prn
   - Continue outpatient singulair
   - If spikes or has leukocytosis consider CAP coverage, no antibiotics
   for now
   .
   # Depression/Insomnia: Continue outpatient trazadone 200 mg qhs.
   .
   # Constipation: bowel regimen uptitrated yesterday without effect.
   Will continue to to titrate to BM.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: rising k, ? tumor lysis, will re-check K this
   afternoon.
   .
   # Social: Patient currently lives in rooming house. Reports stresses at
   home. Has not followed with medical care (multiple do not show
   appointments).  Appreciate SW consult.  Will f/u with social work
   today.

Summary:

The patient is a 47-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, presenting with bilateral lower extremity edema and a pericardial effusion. She was found to have adenocarcinoma in the pleural fluid. A drain was placed on [**9-12**], and the output decreased, leading to its removal on [**9-17**]. The patient has been in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) since admission, with occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). She has been experiencing fluid overload, which has improved since the draining of the effusion.

The patient has several comorbidities, including coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors, asthma, depression, insomnia, constipation, and hyperkalemia. She is not compliant with her oncology follow-up appointments and has not been taking her aromatase inhibitor medication as prescribed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Malignant pleural effusion: The patient's pleural effusion has been confirmed to be adenocarcinoma, and there is a risk of malignant pleural effusion, which can lead to respiratory distress and decreased lung function.
2. Bony metastases: The patient has evidence of bony metastases to the spine, which can lead to spinal cord compression, pain, and neurological deficits.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of asthma and COPD, combined with the possibility of malignant pleural effusion, increases the risk of respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's CAD risk factors and history of pericardial effusion increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and history of pleural effusion increase the risk of infection, including pneumonia and sepsis.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient's rising potassium levels may be due to tumor lysis, and further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent cardiac complications.
7. Depression and insomnia: The patient's depression and insomnia may exacerbate her overall condition and increase her risk of developing other complications.
8. Constipation: The patient's constipation may worsen her overall condition and increase her risk of developing other complications.
9. Social factors: The patient's social situation, including her living situation and lack of compliance with medical appointments, may exacerbate her overall condition and increase her risk of developing other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue pleural drains for 24-48 hours as recommended by the attending physician.
2. Continue Indomethacin and dilaudid for pain control.
3. Restart Lisinopril for hypertension at home dose.
4. Obtain a bone scan non-urgently.
5. Follow up with oncology recommendations.
6. Continue Ipratropium and Albuterol nebulizers as prescribed.
7. Monitor potassium levels closely and consider re-checking this afternoon.
8. Titrate bowel regimen to achieve regular bowel movements.
9. Consult with social work to address the patient's social situation and improve her overall care."
