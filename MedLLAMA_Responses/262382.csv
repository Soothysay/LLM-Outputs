 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, UPPER (MELENA, GI BLEED, GIB)
   60 year old man with history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal
   varices, currently on liver transplant list presenting with upper GI
   bleed in setting of recent MVC, intubated for acute mental status
   changes.
   #  UPPER GI BLEED:  Currently hemodynamically stable.  HCT at OSH was
   34.  Positive NG Lavage at OSH, no coffee grounds here.  Hepatology
   following. Pt will need EGD in AM, sooner if decompensates. Given
   history of varices, this would be most likely cause. Patient however
   had patent TIPS on [**2190-10-6**] which should significantly decrease the
   risk of variceal bleed. In addition to TIPS stenosis would also
   consider peptic ulcer disease, portal gastropathy, etc.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and liver transplant list, who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB) after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). He was intubated for acute mental status changes and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient's mental status is altered, and he is sedated. He has a history of cirrhosis, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, portal vein thrombosis, and chronic back pain.

Recent events include:

* Lumbar puncture (LP) on 11/13 at 12:00 AM, which showed 1 WBC, 2 RBCs, protein 73, glucose 93, and a negative gram stain.
* Ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone antibiotics were administered on 11/12 at 7:09 PM and 9:01 PM, respectively.
* The patient was given propofol at a dose of 20 mcg/kg/min.

Lab results:

* WBC count: 6.1 K/uL
* Hct: 26.2%
* Plt: 54 K/uL
* Cr: 1.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 107 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.0/32.6/1.3, ALT/AST: 18/36, Alk Phos/T Bili: 85/1.1, LDH: 282 IU/L, Ca++: 8.6 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 3.4 mg/dL

Imaging results:

* CT abdomen: No acute intra-abdominal process, cirrhosis with stable TIPS position, and no free fluid in the abdomen.
* CT head: No acute intracranial process.
* CXR: Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate position, minimally displaced fracture of a lateral lower right rib, and vascular engorgement.

Potential medical complications:

* Worsening of altered mental status due to hepatic encephalopathy
* Development of respiratory failure or worsening of existing respiratory failure
* Increased risk of bleeding due to upper gastrointestinal bleed and liver disease
* Risk of infection due to invasive lines and devices
* Potential for TIPS stenosis or thrombosis
* Risk of portal gastropathy or peptic ulcer disease
* Risk of chronic renal insufficiency progression
* Risk of diabetes mellitus complications
* Risk of hypertension complications
* Risk of portal vein thrombosis complications
* Risk of chronic back pain progression

Plan:

* Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust sedation as needed.
* Perform an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to evaluate the upper gastrointestinal tract and identify the source of bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with cirrhosis due to HCV, esophagus varices, and a history of TIPS insertion. He was admitted to the ICU after a recent MVA and is currently intubated for airway protection. He has developed delta MS and is experiencing agitated delirium. His vital signs are stable, and his lab results show signs of liver dysfunction. He is receiving rifaximin and lactulose for treatment of his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and liver dysfunction, he is at risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to altered mental status, seizures, and even death.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of esophagus varices and cirrhosis puts him at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to cirrhosis and liver dysfunction makes him more susceptible to infections, which can be severe and life-threatening.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to manage his respiratory status, and he may require more aggressive respiratory support.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of cirrhosis and liver dysfunction may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
6. Renal failure: The patient's liver dysfunction may lead to kidney dysfunction, which can progress to renal failure.
7. Sepsis: The patient's immunocompromised state and history of liver dysfunction make him more susceptible to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation may increase his risk of developing pneumonia, which can be severe and life-threatening.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, lab results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent or treat them."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with cirrhosis due to HCV, esophageal varices, and a history of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement. He was admitted to the ICU after a motor vehicle accident (MVA) and is currently intubated for airway protection.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 153/83 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a ventilator. His respiratory support includes invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 563 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 6.1 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 54 K/uL. His liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of 18 and 36 IU/L, respectively. His coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prothrombin time (PT) of 15.0 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 32.6 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with a soft, non-tender abdomen and no signs of distension or obesity. He has trace edema in both lower extremities and warm skin.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is being managed with rifaximin and lactulose.
2. Gastrointestinal bleed, which is being monitored for signs of bleeding.
3. Agitation, which is being managed with antipsychotics prior to extubation.
4. Nutrition: NPO for extubation.
5. Glycemic control: Regular insulin sliding scale.
6. Lines: 22-gauge and 20-gauge peripheral IV lines.
7. Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with boots, stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and VAP prophylaxis with HOB elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy worsening, leading to increased agitation and potential sepsis.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding worsening, leading to hypovolemic shock.
3. Respiratory failure, requiring increased ventilatory support or potential extubation.
4. Sepsis, potentially due to infected wounds or catheters.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), potentially due to immobility and thrombocytopenia.
6. Stress ulcer bleeding, potentially due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and use of PPI.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), potentially due to prolonged intubation and immobility.

Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status is essential to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with hepatic encephalopathy and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to portal hypertension and cirrhosis. He has a history of recent motor vehicle collision (MVC) and is on the transplant list. The patient is intubated for airway protection and is receiving sedation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, and blood pressure of 159/76 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 17 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100%. His hemodynamic monitoring shows a stable hematocrit.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.1-4.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.5-9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 54-49 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.8-1.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 107-123 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.4/32.8/1.2, ALT/AST: 18/36, Alk Phos/T Bili: 85/1.1, LDH: 282 IU/L, Ca++: 8.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.7 mg/dL, PO4: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* RUQ ultrasound: Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flow and velocities between 90-190 cm/sec, increased relative to prior studies, which may be secondary to technical factors.
* Unchanged occlusion of the left portal vein.

The patient's microbiology results show:

* Spinal fluid gram stain: No polymorphonuclear leukocytes seen. No microorganisms seen.
* Fluid culture: Pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further bleeding from esophageal varices
* Increased risk of infection due to cirrhosis and immunosuppression
* Development of sepsis due to portal hypertension and cirrhosis
* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Development of chronic renal insufficiency due to cirrhosis
* Development of diabetes mellitus due to cirrhosis and immunosuppression
* Development of portal vein thrombosis due to cirrhosis and portal hypertension
* Development of chronic back pain due to portal hypertension and cirrhosis.

The patient's plan includes:

* IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Hold octreotide per GI
* CTX for SBP prophylaxis
* Active T&S
* Hold coumadin
* Wean sedation for trial of extubation
* Continue lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
* Restart propranolol if/when hemodynamically stable after extubation
* Follow up CSF and blood cultures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with hepatic encephalopathy and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) who was admitted to the ICU for airway protection. The patient has a history of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and left portal vein thrombosis, and is on the transplant list. The patient was intubated for airway protection due to hepatic encephalopathy and has been receiving lactulose and rifaximin for treatment.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 159/76 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% and heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.1-4.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.5-9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 54-49 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.8-1.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 107-123 mg/dL
* Other lab results include elevated liver enzymes, elevated bilirubin, and decreased albumin.

The patient's imaging results show a patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flow and velocities between 90-190 cm/sec, and unchanged occlusion of the left portal vein.

The patient's medical history includes chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, portal vein thrombosis, and chronic back pain.

The patient's current medications include lactulose, rifaximin, pantoprazole, and ciprofloxacin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further bleeding from the esophageal varices
* Increased risk of infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state
* Hepatic encephalopathy worsening or not responding to treatment
* Renal insufficiency worsening or not responding to treatment
* Portal vein thrombosis worsening or not responding to treatment
* Increased risk of sepsis or organ failure due to the patient's underlying medical conditions
* Worsening of the patient's respiratory status due to the patient's underlying lung disease or respiratory failure."

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of hepatic cirrhosis, portal hypertension, esophageal varices, and left portal vein thrombosis, who is on the transplant list. He was admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and intubated for airway protection due to hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, with stable hemoglobin levels, and is receiving lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 57 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 159/76 mmHg. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% fraction of inspired oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 54 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 107 mg/dL
* Alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 18 IU/L
* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 36 IU/L
* Alkaline phosphatase: 85 IU/L
* Total bilirubin: 1.1 mg/dL
* Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 282 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Patent TIPS with wall-to-wall flow and velocities between 90 and 190 cm/sec
* Unchanged occlusion of the left portal vein
* RUQ ultrasound: patent TIPS with unchanged occlusion of the left portal vein

Potential medical complications:

* UGIB: continued bleeding, requiring further treatment and monitoring
* Hepatic encephalopathy: progression to more severe encephalopathy, requiring adjustments to lactulose and rifaximin dosing
* Chronic renal insufficiency: progression to chronic kidney disease, requiring further monitoring and potential treatment
* Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycemia, requiring adjustments to insulin dosing
* Hypertension: uncontrolled blood pressure, requiring further treatment and monitoring
* Portal vein thrombosis: potential for further thrombosis or embolism, requiring further monitoring and potential treatment
* Chronic back pain: potential for further pain management issues, requiring further evaluation and treatment
* FEN: potential for further electrolyte imbalances, requiring further monitoring and potential treatment
* PPX: potential for further pneumoboots, requiring further monitoring and potential treatment"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with HCV cirrhosis and a history of esophageal varices bleeding, who presented with hepatic encephalopathy of unclear etiology. He was initially intubated for airway protection, but was extubated this morning and is doing well.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is no longer intubated and is breathing spontaneously, with a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a normal sinus rhythm, with a blood pressure of 122/83 mmHg and a heart rate of 55 beats per minute.
* Neurological: The patient is delirious, but is attentive and follows simple commands.
* Abdominal: The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 6.1-4.6 K/uL
* Hct: 26.2-28.9%
* Plt: 54-49 K/uL
* Cr: 1.8-1.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 107-123 mg/dL

The patient is being treated for hepatic encephalopathy and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. He is also receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's condition can worsen, leading to increased levels of ammonia in the blood, which can cause further neurological symptoms.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is still elevated, and he may require further respiratory support.
* Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and he may be at risk for developing sepsis.
* Bleeding: The patient's history of esophageal varices bleeding and cirrhosis make him at risk for bleeding complications.
* Infection: The patient's delirious state and elevated WBC count make him at risk for developing an infection.
* Liver failure: The patient's cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy make him at risk for liver failure.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting his treatment plan as needed to prevent these potential complications from occurring."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with HCV cirrhosis and a history of esophageal varices bleeding, who presented with unclear etiology of hepatic encephalopathy. He was initially intubated for airway protection but was extubated during rounds. The patient is currently extubated and doing well. He is receiving treatment for hepatic encephalopathy and is being monitored for potential bleeding. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 55 bpm, and blood pressure of 122/83 mmHg. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via face tent and standby ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's condition can deteriorate if not properly managed, leading to increased risk of seizures, coma, and death.
2. Bleeding: The patient's history of esophageal varices bleeding and ongoing liver disease increases the risk of bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
3. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to liver disease and prolonged hospitalization increases the risk of infection, which can be difficult to treat.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is closely monitored, but there is a risk of respiratory failure if his condition worsens.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's liver disease and potential bleeding can lead to cardiovascular instability, including hypotension and tachycardia.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's hepatic encephalopathy can lead to neurological complications, including seizures, coma, and death.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's liver disease and potential bleeding can lead to malnutrition, which can worsen his overall condition.
8. DVT and VAP: The patient is at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to his prolonged hospitalization and immobility.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue aggressive treatment for hepatic encephalopathy, monitor his vital signs closely, and adjust his care plan as needed to prevent complications."
