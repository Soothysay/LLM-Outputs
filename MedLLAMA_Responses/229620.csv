You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure, sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and renal failure. She has a history of CAD, s/p CABG, s/p AVR with porcine valve, hypertension, and diabetes. Her current condition is characterized by:

* Cardiogenic shock with low cardiac output, cold extremities, and elevated troponin levels
* Sepsis with bilateral pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and significant leukocytosis
* Renal failure with hypotension and prerenal azotemia
* Hypoxemic respiratory failure with ARDS-like features
* Anemia with low HCT and no obvious bleeding source
* Mild shock liver with elevated LFTs
* Hyperglycemia with need for insulin therapy
* Hypertension with need for medication adjustment
* Hyperlipidemia with need for statin therapy
* GERD with need for medication adjustment
* Glaucoma with need for eye drop therapy
* OSA with need for nocturnal oxygen therapy
* PVD with need for aspirin and statin therapy

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: continued cardiogenic shock, low cardiac output, and potential for further cardiac damage.
2. Sepsis complications: potential for further organ dysfunction, septic shock, and death.
3. Respiratory complications: continued hypoxemic respiratory failure, potential for further respiratory deterioration, and need for mechanical ventilation.
4. Renal complications: potential for further renal failure, need for dialysis, and potential for electrolyte imbalances.
5. Anemia complications: potential for further anemia, need for transfusions, and potential for bleeding complications.
6. Liver complications: potential for further liver dysfunction, need for liver support, and potential for liver failure.
7. Hyperglycemia complications: potential for further hyperglycemia, need for insulin therapy, and potential for ketoacidosis.
8. Hypertension complications: potential for further hypertension, need for medication adjustment, and potential for cardiovascular complications.
9. Hyperlipidemia complications: potential for further hyperlipidemia, need for statin therapy, and potential for cardiovascular complications.
10. GERD complications: potential for further GERD symptoms, need for medication adjustment, and potential for aspiration pneumonia.
11. Glaucoma complications: potential for further glaucoma symptoms, need for eye drop therapy, and potential for vision loss.
12. OSA complications: potential for further OSA symptoms, need for nocturnal oxygen therapy, and potential for respiratory complications.
13. PVD complications: potential for further PVD symptoms, need for aspirin and statin therapy, and potential for cardiovascular complications.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of her various medical complications to prevent further deterioration and improve her chances of recovery."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old female with past medical history significant for CAD s/p
   CABG, s/p AVR with porcine valve, Htn, DM, presents with sepsis from
   pulmonary or urinary source, cardiogenic shock in setting of NSTEMI,
   and  renal failure.
   # Septic shock: Significant Leukocytosis. Fever. Bilateral Pneumonia,
   Urinary tract infection. given vanc/ceftriax/azithro. Given smoking
   history and elevated LDH  concerned for post-obstructive. Will treat
   vanc/zosyn. Cipro for urinary coverage and double GNR. Image procine
   AVR for signs endocarditis. In past 5 years has had pneumonvax.
   - vanc level in am
   - CVP now >12 and septic component of her shock has improved, but
   remains with cardiogenic as above
   - femoral a-line, dobutamine and levophed for MAP >65
   - zosyn/cipro
   - send for flu
   - urine legionella
   - sputum, blood, urine, stool cx
   - TTE to eval EF and AVR
   - consider BAL given hypoxemia, to eval for PJP or endobronchial lesion
   with obstruction
   - hold anti-hypertensives
   # Cardiogenic Shock/ NSTEMI/ Known CAD: EKG changes. In setting of
   demand, but with signficant troponin. Mycocardial stunning from oxygen
   demand, CvO2 low, extremities are cold.
   - start heparin drip
   - on dobutamine
   - trend troponin
   - aspirin, statin, plavix
   - holding metoprolol
   - repeat EKG
   - given blood
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: in setting of pneumonia. hx prior
   trach
   - sedation midaz/fentanyl
   - ARDS net ventilation -- wean FiO2 and increase PEEP
   - antibiotics as above
   - consider BAL as above
   # Renal Failure - hypotension in sepsis and cardiogenic. urinary lytes
   prerenal, FeNa o.2%
   - follow UOP goal 30 ml/hr
   - f/u urine culture
   - trend creatinine
   # Anemia: hx HCT 30, on admit 26-29. No obvious bleeding source. Does
   have hx of hemorrhoids. In setting of low CvO2 and cardiogenic shock
   will transfuse.
   - tranfuse 2 units pRBCs
   - trend HCT and CvO2
   - guaiac
   # LFTs: ALT/AST
   - concerned mild shock liver, will trend
   # DM2: hold hypoglycemics
   - start HISS prn
   # Hyperlipidemia
   - increase simvastatin to 80mg given NSTEMI
   # GERD
   - lansoprazole b/c intubated cannot take omeprazole
   # Glaucoma
   - cont timolol eye drops
   # OSA on nocturnal oxygen
   - note will always need nighttime O2

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus (DM). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 39.5°C (103.1°F)
* Heart rate: 120 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 103/45 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 34%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 7 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 14.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.6 g/dL
* Creatinine: 2.9 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.4 mmol/L
* Troponin-T: 10.06 ng/mL
* ALT/AST: 2193/2212 IU/L

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Septic shock: The patient has a high white blood cell count, fever, and bilateral pneumonia, which suggests septic shock. She is being treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin and ciprofloxacin.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has a low cardiac output, as evidenced by her low CvO2 and cold extremities. She is being treated with dobutamine and levophed to increase her mean arterial pressure (MAP) to greater than 65 mmHg.
3. Renal failure: The patient has a creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL, which suggests renal failure. She is being treated with fluids and antibiotics to try to improve her renal function.
4. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL, which may be contributing to her cardiogenic shock. She is being transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs).
5. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has a low oxygen saturation of 34% and is being treated with sedation, mechanical ventilation, and antibiotics.
6. LFTs: The patient has elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), which may be due to mild shock liver. She will be monitored for any changes in her liver function.
7. DM2: The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and is being treated with regular insulin sliding scale.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is being treated with simvastatin to reduce her cholesterol levels.
9. GERD: The patient is being treated with lansoprazole to reduce her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Glaucoma: The patient is being treated with timolol eye drops to reduce her intraocular pressure.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiogenic shock and low cardiac output may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemic respiratory failure may worsen if her oxygen saturation does not improve.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen if her creatinine level continues to rise.
4. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock may worsen if her infection is not properly treated.
5. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and low platelet count may increase her risk of bleeding.
6. Infection: The patient's septic shock and hypoxemic respiratory failure may increase her risk of infection.
7. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's cardiogenic shock and low cardiac output may increase her risk of cardiac tamponade.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and potential complications. She requires close monitoring and treatment to manage her sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and renal failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old female with past medical history significant for CAD s/p
   CABG, s/p AVR with porcine valve, HTN, DM2, presents with sepsis from
   pulmonary source, cardiogenic shock in setting of NSTEMI, acute renal
   failure, and shock liver.  The most important
   # Septic shock: Bilateral pneumonia.  Sputum/blood cultures pending.
   Appears as if patient has been fluid resucitated adequately.  Influenza
   negative.
   - Continue vancomycin (dose by level), zosyn, ciprofloxacin
   - Sputum, blood cultures pending
   - Continue vasopressin, levophed for goal MAP > 55
   - Hold anti-hypertensives
   # NSTEMI: Patient appears to have primarily distributive shock at this
   time but there may be a component of cardiogenic shock.  She has known
   CAD s/p CABG in [**2194**].  Anterolateral EKG changes.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Continue hepatin gtt x 48 hours
   - TTE today
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 30
   - Continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - Holding metoprolol for hypotension, statin for liver failure
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Pneumonia/ARDS.
   - Decrease tidal volume and wean settings as tolerated
   - Antibiotics as above
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had pre-renal urine electrolytes on
   admission due to sepsis and cardiogenic shock.  She continues to be
   anuric, not responsive to fluids, and now likely has transitioned to
   acute tubular necrosis.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Goals of care discussion as above regarding initiation of CVVH
   # Anemia: Stable status post 2U PRBC to increase CvO2.  No signs or
   symptoms of active bleeding.
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 30
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Shock liver: AST/ALT > [**2187**].
   - Hold statin
   - Continue to trend
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Mottled extremities on pressors.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Attempt to wean pressors if tolerated
   # Type 2 diabetes: Improved control with insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding statin in setting of liver failure.
   # GERD: Increased PPI to [**Hospital1 **] given gastocult positive NG drainage.
   # Glaucoma: Continue timolol eye drops.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old female with past medical history significant for CAD s/p
   CABG, s/p AVR with porcine valve, HTN, DM2, presents with sepsis from
   pulmonary source, cardiogenic shock in setting of NSTEMI, acute renal
   failure, and shock liver.  The most important
   # Septic shock: Bilateral pneumonia.  Sputum/blood cultures pending.
   Appears as if patient has been fluid resucitated adequately.  Influenza
   negative.
   - Continue vancomycin (dose by level), zosyn, ciprofloxacin
   - Sputum, blood cultures pending
   - Continue vasopressin, levophed for goal MAP > 55
   - Hold anti-hypertensives
   # NSTEMI: Patient appears to have primarily distributive shock at this
   time but there may be a component of cardiogenic shock.  She has known
   CAD s/p CABG in [**2194**].  Anterolateral EKG changes.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Continue hepatin gtt x 48 hours
   - TTE today
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 30
   - Continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - Holding metoprolol for hypotension, statin for liver failure
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Pneumonia/ARDS.
   - Decrease tidal volume and wean settings as tolerated
   - Antibiotics as above
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had pre-renal urine electrolytes on
   admission due to sepsis and cardiogenic shock.  She continues to be
   anuric, not responsive to fluids, and now likely has transitioned to
   acute tubular necrosis.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Goals of care discussion as above regarding initiation of CVVH
   # Anemia: Stable status post 2U PRBC to increase CvO2.  No signs or
   symptoms of active bleeding.
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 30
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Shock liver: AST/ALT > [**2187**].
   - Hold statin
   - Continue to trend
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Mottled extremities on pressors.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Attempt to wean pressors if tolerated
   # Type 2 diabetes: Improved control with insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding statin in setting of liver failure.
   # GERD: Increased PPI to [**Hospital1 **] given gastocult positive NG drainage.
   # Glaucoma: Continue timolol eye drops.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old female with past medical history significant for CAD s/p
   CABG, s/p AVR with porcine valve, Htn, DM, presents with sepsis from
   pulmonary or urinary source, cardiogenic shock in setting of NSTEMI,
   and  renal failure.
   # Septic shock: Significant Leukocytosis. Fever. Bilateral Pneumonia,
   Urinary tract infection. given vanc/ceftriax/azithro. Given smoking
   history and elevated LDH  concerned for post-obstructive. Will treat
   vanc/zosyn. Cipro for urinary coverage and double GNR. Image procine
   AVR for signs endocarditis. In past 5 years has had pneumonvax.
   - vanc level in am
   - CVP now >12 and septic component of her shock has improved, but
   remains with cardiogenic as above
   - femoral a-line, dobutamine and levophed for MAP >65
   - zosyn/cipro
   - send for flu
   - urine legionella
   - sputum, blood, urine, stool cx
   - TTE to eval EF and AVR
   - consider BAL given hypoxemia, to eval for PJP or endobronchial lesion
   with obstruction
   - hold anti-hypertensives
   # Cardiogenic Shock/ NSTEMI/ Known CAD: EKG changes. In setting of
   demand, but with signficant troponin. Mycocardial stunning from oxygen
   demand, CvO2 low, extremities are cold.
   - start heparin drip
   - on dobutamine
   - trend troponin
   - aspirin, statin, plavix
   - holding metoprolol
   - repeat EKG
   - given blood
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: in setting of pneumonia. hx prior
   trach
   - sedation midaz/fentanyl
   - ARDS net ventilation -- wean FiO2 and increase PEEP
   - antibiotics as above
   - consider BAL as above
   # Renal Failure - hypotension in sepsis and cardiogenic. urinary lytes
   prerenal, FeNa o.2%
   - follow UOP goal 30 ml/hr
   - f/u urine culture
   - trend creatinine
   # Anemia: hx HCT 30, on admit 26-29. No obvious bleeding source. Does
   have hx of hemorrhoids. In setting of low CvO2 and cardiogenic shock
   will transfuse.
   - tranfuse 2 units pRBCs
   - trend HCT and CvO2
   - guaiac
   # LFTs: ALT/AST
   - concerned mild shock liver, will trend
   # DM2: hold hypoglycemics
   - start HISS prn
   # Hyperlipidemia
   - increase simvastatin to 80mg given NSTEMI
   # GERD
   - lansoprazole b/c intubated cannot take omeprazole
   # Glaucoma
   - cont timolol eye drops
   # OSA on nocturnal oxygen
   - note will always need nighttime O2

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a significant past medical history, including CAD, s/p CABG, s/p AVR with porcine valve, hypertension, and diabetes. She is currently in the ICU due to sepsis, cardiogenic shock, and renal failure.

The patient's condition has been managed with various medications and treatments, including vasopressors, insulin, and blood products. However, her condition remains unstable, with a low cardiac output, hypoxemia, and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock may worsen due to ongoing sepsis, hypotension, and low cardiac output.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may worsen due to ongoing sepsis, hypotension, and low cardiac output.
4. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen due to ongoing infection and inadequate treatment.
5. Endocarditis: The patient's porcine valve may be at risk for endocarditis due to the presence of bacteria in the blood.
6. Myocardial infarction: The patient's NSTEMI may worsen due to ongoing cardiogenic shock and low cardiac output.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hemodynamic instability may worsen due to ongoing sepsis, hypotension, and low cardiac output.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen due to ongoing renal failure and inadequate treatment.
9. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen due to ongoing sepsis, hypotension, and low cardiac output.
10. Organ failure: The patient's organs, including the kidneys, liver, and heart, may fail due to ongoing sepsis, hypotension, and low cardiac output.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year-old female with past medical history significant for CAD s/p
   CABG, s/p porcine AVR, HTN, DM2, presents with sepsis from pulmonary
   source, cardiogenic shock in setting of NSTEMI, acute renal failure,
   and shock liver.  The patient has an increasingly grim prognosis given
   multiorgan system failure.  The most important plan for today is to
   readdress goals of care with the patient
s family.
   # Septic shock: Bilateral pneumonia.  Sputum/blood cultures pending.
   Appears as if patient has been fluid resucitated adequately now with
   CVP 15-17, no respiratory variation.  Influenza negative.
   - Continue vancomycin (dose by level), zosyn, ciprofloxacin
   - Sputum, blood cultures pending
   - Continue vasopressin, levophed for goal MAP > 55
   - Hold anti-hypertensives
   # NSTEMI: Patient appears to have primarily distributive shock at this
   time but there may be a component of cardiogenic shock.  She has known
   CAD s/p CABG in [**2194**].  Anterolateral EKG changes.  CK has peaked,
   however, troponin T continues to rise.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Continue hepatin gtt x 48 hours
   - TTE today
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 30
   - Continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - Holding metoprolol for hypotension and holding statin for liver
   failure
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Pneumonia/ARDS.
   - Decrease tidal volume and wean settings as tolerated
   - Antibiotics as above
   # Acute renal failure: Patient had pre-renal urine electrolytes on
   admission due to sepsis +/- cardiogenic shock.  She continues to be
   anuric, not responsive to fluids, and now likely has transitioned to
   acute tubular necrosis.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Start bicarbonate gtt
   - Goals of care discussion as above regarding initiation of CVVH
   # Anemia: Stable > 30 status post 2U PRBC to increase CvO2.  No signs
   or symptoms of active bleeding.
   - Transfuse for hematocrit < 30
   - Guaiac all stools
   # Shock liver: AST/ALT > [**2187**].
   - Hold statin
   - Continue to trend
   # Peripheral vascular disease: Mottled extremities on pressors.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix
   - Attempt to wean pressors if tolerated
   # Type 2 diabetes: Improved control with insulin gtt.
   - Continue insulin gtt
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding statin in setting of liver failure
   # GERD: Increased PPI to [**Hospital1 **] given gastocult positive NG drainage
   # Glaucoma: Continue timolol eye drops

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old female with a significant past medical history, including CAD, s/p CABG, s/p porcine AVR, HTN, DM2, and presents with sepsis from a pulmonary source, cardiogenic shock in the setting of NSTEMI, acute renal failure, and shock liver. The patient has an increasingly grim prognosis given multiorgan system failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiovascular: Cardiogenic shock with a cardiac index of 1.2 L/min/m2, and a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 45 mmHg. The patient is receiving vasopressin and levophed to maintain a goal MAP > 55.
* Respiratory: Hypoxemic respiratory failure with a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 34 mmHg and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 430 mL and a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute.
* Renal: Acute renal failure with anuria and a creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL. The patient is receiving renally dosed medications and avoiding nephrotoxins.
* Hepatic: Shock liver with elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT > 2187).
* Neurological: The patient is sedated and responsive to verbal stimuli.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition are:

* Cardiac arrest due to continued cardiogenic shock
* Respiratory failure due to hypoxemia and potential development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Renal failure due to continued anuria and potential development of acute tubular necrosis
* Hepatic failure due to continued shock liver and potential development of fulminant hepatic failure
* Neurological decline due to continued sedation and potential development of septic encephalopathy
* Infection due to continued sepsis and potential development of secondary infections
* Bleeding due to continued thrombocytopenia and potential development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

The patient's care plan includes:

* Readdressing goals of care with the patient's family
* Continuing vancomycin, zosyn, and ciprofloxacin for sepsis
* Continuing vasopressin and levophed for cardiogenic shock
* Holding anti-hypertensives
* Transfusing for hematocrit < 30
* Trending cardiac enzymes
* Holding statin for liver failure
* Continuing insulin gtt for glucose control
* Continuing PPI for GERD
* Continuing timolol eye drops for glaucoma

The patient's disposition is currently listed as ICU, and the code status is DNR (do not resuscitate)."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old woman p/w pneumonia, septic shock, and NSTEMI. Now with
   shock liver and progressive acute renal failure. Prognosis is
   increasingly grim.
   High dose pressors despite adequate volume resuscitation(CVP 15, no
   pulse pressure variation). Worsening metabolic acidosis will speak with
   family today about RRT and possibly consult renal. Troponins still
   increasing but no utility to cardiac intervention. Will check TTE today
   but appears to be in primarily distributive shock at this point.
   Further plans as per resident note.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old woman with a history of CAD, AVR, and p/w septic shock, pneumonia, and NSTEMI. She has developed multiorgan failure, including shock liver, acute renal failure, and pressor dependence. Her condition is worsening, with increasing troponins and metabolic acidosis. The patient's code status has been changed to DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is likely to worsen due to her increasing troponins and metabolic acidosis, which may lead to further organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to progress, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potential need for RRT (renal replacement therapy).
3. Shock Liver: The patient's shock liver is likely to worsen, leading to further liver dysfunction and potential liver failure.
4. NSTEMI: The patient's NSTEMI is likely to progress, leading to further cardiac damage and potential need for cardiac intervention.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's worsening metabolic acidosis may lead to further organ dysfunction and failure.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
7. Cardiovascular Failure: The patient's cardiovascular failure is likely to worsen, leading to further cardiac damage and potential need for cardiac intervention.

Recommendations:

1. Continue high-dose pressors to maintain blood pressure and perfusion.
2. Consider RRT for acute renal failure.
3. Monitor troponins and metabolic acidosis closely to guide further management.
4. Consider cardiac intervention for NSTEMI.
5. Continue respiratory support with mechanical ventilation and consider ECMO if necessary.
6. Monitor for signs of cardiovascular failure and consider further cardiac intervention if necessary.
7. Consider palliative care consultation to discuss end-of-life care with the patient and her family."

   Assessment and Plan
   72 year old woman p/w pneumonia, septic shock, and NSTEMI. Now with
   shock liver and progressive acute renal failure. Prognosis is
   increasingly grim.
   High dose pressors despite adequate volume resuscitation(CVP 15, no
   pulse pressure variation). Worsening metabolic acidosis will speak with
   family today about
   RRT and possibly consult renal. Troponins still increasing but no
   utility to cardiac intervention. Will check TTE today but appears to be
   in primarily distributive shock at this point.
   Further plans as per resident note.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 72-year-old woman with a history of CAD, AVR, and pneumonia, who has developed septic shock, NSTEMI, and is now experiencing shock liver and progressive acute renal failure. She is receiving high-dose pressors despite adequate volume resuscitation, and her prognosis is increasingly grim. Her metabolic acidosis is worsening, and she may require renal replacement therapy (RRT). Her cardiac condition is not improving, and cardiac intervention is unlikely to be beneficial.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progressive acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and her prognosis is grim. She may require RRT to manage her kidney function.
2. Shock liver: The patient's liver function is compromised, which can lead to further complications, such as coagulopathy and decreased albumin production.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's acid-base imbalance is worsening, which can lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory depression, and decreased tissue perfusion.
4. Cardiac instability: The patient's cardiac condition is not improving, and cardiac intervention is unlikely to be beneficial. This can lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrest and death.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and on mechanical ventilation, and her respiratory status is critical. Further deterioration can lead to respiratory failure and death.
6. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis is causing organ dysfunction, which can lead to further complications, such as adrenal insufficiency, pancreatitis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
7. Infection control: The patient is at risk of developing further infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI), which can worsen her condition and increase her risk of mortality.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent further complications and improve her chances of survival."
