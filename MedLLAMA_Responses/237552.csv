   Assessment and Plan
   24yo F with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant hypertension presents with
   abdominal pain and headache this morning and admitted for hypertensive
   urgency.
   .
   1. Hypertensive Urgency: BP elevated on arrival to 260/130. Pt reports
   taking all medication as prescribed.  Differential includes
   hypertension secondary to abdominal pain, pheochromocytoma, [**Location (un) 6367**]
   disease.  Pt denies drug use including cocaine, amphetamines.  Had HD
   yesterday so volume overload is less likely.  Likely has an anxiety
   component precipitating hypertension.
   - continue PO Labetolol 400mg TID, Hydralazine 100mg PO q8H, Nifedipine
   90mg PO qday, Clonidine
   - attempt to wean Labetolol gtt
   - IV Hydralazine for goal BP < 180/100
   - serum metanephrines pending from last admission
   - check tox screen
   .
   2. Abdominal Pain: Extensive prior workup unrevealing.  KUB done today
   without free air or evidence of SBO.  LFTs normal. Contributing to
   abdominal pain can be narcotic use, ascites with potential for SBP or
   infection.  Pt had recent CT scan which did not show source of
   abdominal pain.
   - send peritoneal fluid for cell count, gram stain and culture
   - if cell counts look like SBP, will start Cipro
   - consider pulling PD catheter depending on results
   - per patient, pain best controlled with Dilaudid which she takes at
   home, will attempt PO Dilaudid to avoid addicting complications of IV
   Dilaudid
   - add on lipase and amylase
   .
   3. ESRD: HD yesterday. On T/Th/Sat schedule.  Pt currently undergoing
   HD due to recent ex-lap but was on PD prior to this and would like to
   go back to PD which can be done 3 weeks post-op per discharge summary.
   - check Ca/Phos tomorrow
   - HD tomorrow
   - renal following
   .
   4. Hx of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT: Pt is subtherapeutic on coumadin.
   Unclear if not currently taking Coumadin although patient states that
   she has been taking all home meds.
   - heparin gtt to bridge to Coumadin
   - Coumadin 5mg PO qday
   .
   5. Anxiety: Likely contributing to medical problems and may be etiology
   of admission.  Although pt states she is taking her current
   medications, does report increased anxiety which can lead to medication
   non-compliance and hypertension.  Pt recently saw psychiatrist who
   started her on Celexa.
   - continue Celexa 20mg PO qday
   - Ativan 1mg PO q8hours PRN
   - psych consult in the AM
   .
   6. Anemia: currently at baseline.  Likely related to ESRD.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   7. SLE:
   - continue Prednisone 20mg PO qday
   .
   8. FEN: regular diet, replete lytes PRN
   .
   9. Prophylaxis: Heparin gtt, no need for ulcer prophylaxis at this
   time, bowel regigmen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and malignant hypertension. She was admitted for hypertensive urgency due to abdominal pain and headache.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.8°C, Tcurrent 36.4°C, HR 92 bpm, BP 183/127 mmHg, RR 16 inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%.
* Physical examination: The patient is well-appearing, with a midline scar well-healed, soft, diffusely tender to palpation, and +rebound, no guarding. PD catheter in LLQ without erythema or purulent material draining. +dullness on percussion with evidence of clinical ascites.
* Laboratory results: WBC 5.8 K/uL, Hct 30.4%, Plt 217 K/uL, Cr 4.5 mg/dL, Glucose 89 mg/dL, and other lab results within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's BP remains elevated, and there is a risk of further complications such as cardiac damage, stroke, or kidney damage.
2. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain may be related to ascites, potential SBP or infection, and the patient's recent CT scan did not show a source of abdominal pain.
3. ESRD: The patient's ESRD is a significant underlying condition, and there is a risk of further kidney damage or worsening of her condition.
4. SLE: The patient's SLE may be contributing to her abdominal pain and hypertension, and there is a risk of further flares or complications.
5. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety may be contributing to her hypertension and medical non-compliance, and there is a risk of further complications if left untreated.
6. Thrombotic events: The patient has a history of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT and is currently subtherapeutic on coumadin, which increases the risk of further thrombotic events.
7. Infection: The patient's PD catheter and ascites increase the risk of infection, and the patient's recent CT scan did not show a source of abdominal pain, which may indicate a potential infection.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the plan of care should focus on:

1. Managing the patient's hypertension and abdominal pain with medication and further evaluation.
2. Monitoring the patient's ESRD and kidney function.
3. Managing the patient's SLE and potential flares.
4. Addressing the patient's anxiety and potential medical non-compliance.
5. Monitoring the patient's thrombotic risk and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as needed.
6. Monitoring the patient for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as needed.
7. Providing education to the patient and her family regarding her condition, treatment plan, and potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   24yo F with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant hypertension presents with
   abdominal pain and headache this morning and admitted for hypertensive
   urgency.
   .
   1. Hypertensive Urgency: BP elevated on arrival to 260/130. Pt reports
   taking all medication as prescribed.  Differential includes
   hypertension secondary to abdominal pain, pheochromocytoma, [**Location (un) 6367**]
   disease.  Pt denies drug use including cocaine, amphetamines.  Had HD
   yesterday so volume overload is less likely.  Likely has an anxiety
   component precipitating hypertension.  Tox screen negative.
   - continue PO Labetolol 400mg TID, Hydralazine 100mg PO q8H, Nifedipine
   90mg PO qday, Clonidine
   - attempt to wean Labetolol gtt
   - IV Hydralazine for goal BP < 180/100
   - serum metanephrines pending from last admission
   .
   2. Abdominal Pain: Extensive prior workup unrevealing.  KUB done today
   without free air or evidence of SBO.  LFTs normal. Contributing to
   abdominal pain can be narcotic use, ascites with potential for SBP or
   infection.  Pt had recent CT scan which did not show source of
   abdominal pain. Cell counts show polys of 180.  Gram stain negative for
   organisms.
   - consider starting SBP treatment per renal; will f/u renal recs
   - consider pulling PD catheter depending on results and per renal team
   - per patient, pain best controlled with Dilaudid which she takes at
   home, will attempt PO Dilaudid to avoid addicting complications of IV
   Dilaudid
   .
   3. ESRD: HD yesterday. On T/Th/Sat schedule.  Pt currently undergoing
   HD due to recent ex-lap but was on PD prior to this and would like to
   go back to PD which can be done 3 weeks post-op per discharge summary.
   - HD today
   - renal following
   .
   4. Hx of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT: Pt is subtherapeutic on coumadin.
   Unclear if not currently taking Coumadin although patient states that
   she has been taking all home meds.
   - heparin gtt to bridge to Coumadin
   - Coumadin 5mg PO qday
   .
   5. Anxiety: Likely contributing to medical problems and may be etiology
   of admission.  Although pt states she is taking her current
   medications, does report increased anxiety which can lead to medication
   non-compliance and hypertension.  Pt recently saw psychiatrist who
   started her on Celexa.
   - continue Celexa 20mg PO qday
   - Ativan 1mg PO q8hours PRN
   - psych consult
   .
   6. Anemia: currently at baseline.  Likely related to ESRD.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   7. SLE:
   - continue Prednisone 20mg PO qday
   .
   8. FEN: regular diet, replete lytes PRN
   .
   9. Prophylaxis: Heparin gtt, no need for ulcer prophylaxis at this
   time, bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

The patient, a 24-year-old African-American woman with SLE, ESRD on HD, and malignant hypertension, was admitted for hypertensive urgency. She presented with abdominal pain and headache, which were initially thought to be related to abdominal pain, pheochromocytoma, or medication non-compliance. However, further evaluation revealed no evidence of free air or SBO on KUB, and LFTs were normal. The patient's abdominal pain is likely related to ascites, potential SBP or infection, and narcotic use.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and the risk of hypertensive crisis remains high. Continued monitoring and management with IV Hydralazine and oral medications are necessary.
2. Abdominal Complications: The patient's abdominal pain may be a sign of underlying complications such as SBP, infection, or bowel obstruction. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address these potential complications.
3. Anxiety and Non-Compliance: The patient's anxiety may be contributing to her medical problems, including hypertension and non-compliance with medication. Psychiatric evaluation and therapy may be necessary to address these issues.
4. Thrombotic Complications: The patient has a history of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT and is currently subtherapeutic on Coumadin. Heparin gtt may be necessary to bridge to Coumadin.
5. Infection: The patient's ascites and potential SBP or infection increase the risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment are necessary if infection occurs.
6. Nutritional Complications: The patient's ESRD and HD may lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances. Monitoring of nutritional status and electrolyte levels is necessary to prevent complications.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypertension and ESRD increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and stroke. Monitoring of cardiovascular status and prompt treatment of any complications are necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old with a chief complaint of hypertensive urgency, SLE, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). They were admitted to the ICU for management of their condition. The patient has a dialysis catheter in place and is receiving hemodialysis (HD) this morning. They have a history of ascites and an indwelling peritoneal dialysis catheter. The patient is currently on home regimen for SBP, but DBP remains high. They have a rash and itching due to penicillins and Percocet, respectively. The patient is also taking coumadin for SVC thrombosis and Celexa for depression.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, with a SBP of 213 mmHg and a DBP of 129 mmHg. The patient is receiving labetalol drip and has transitioned to home regimen as tolerated with prn hydralazine sliding scale. The patient will continue to receive HD this morning to assist with volume overload.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient already has ESRD, and the high blood pressure may exacerbate the condition.
2. Volume overload: The patient is receiving HD, which may help with volume overload, but the patient's blood pressure remains elevated, which may indicate ongoing volume overload.
3. Ascites: The patient has a history of ascites and an indwelling peritoneal dialysis catheter, which may lead to further complications if not managed properly.
4. Infections: The patient's low WBC count may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be further evaluated.
5. SVC thrombosis: The patient is receiving coumadin for SVC thrombosis, which needs to be monitored closely to prevent further complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to ESRD and needs to be monitored closely.
7. Depression: The patient is taking Celexa for depression, which needs to be monitored closely for any changes in mood or behavior.
8. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, which may lead to further complications if not managed properly."

   24yo F with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant hypertension presents with
   abdominal pain and headache this morning and admitted for hypertensive
   urgency.
   .
   1. Hypertensive Urgency: BP elevated on arrival to 260/130. Pt reports
   taking all medication as prescribed.  Differential includes
   hypertension secondary to abdominal pain, pheochromocytoma, [**Location (un) 6367**]
   disease.  Pt denies drug use including cocaine, amphetamines.  Had HD
   yesterday so volume overload is less likely.  Likely has an anxiety
   component precipitating hypertension.  Tox screen negative.
   - continue PO Labetolol 400mg TID, Hydralazine 100mg PO q8H, Nifedipine
   90mg PO qday, Clonidine
   - IV Hydralazine for goal BP < 180/100
   - serum metanephrines pending from last admission
   2. Abdominal Pain: Extensive prior workup unrevealing.  KUB done today
   without free air or evidence of SBO.  LFTs normal. Contributing to
   abdominal pain can be narcotic use, ascites with potential for SBP or
   infection.  Pt had recent CT scan which did not show source of
   abdominal pain. Cell counts show polys of 180.  Gram stain negative for
   organisms.
   - consider starting SBP treatment per renal; will f/u renal recs
   - consider pulling PD catheter depending on results and per renal team
   - per patient, pain best controlled with Dilaudid which she takes at
   home, will attempt PO Dilaudid to avoid addicting complications of IV
   Dilaudid
   .
   3. ESRD: HD yesterday. On T/Th/Sat schedule.  Pt currently undergoing
   HD due to recent ex-lap but was on PD prior to this and would like to
   go back to PD which can be done 3 weeks post-op per discharge summary.
   - HD today
   - renal following
   .
   4. Hx of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT: Pt is subtherapeutic on coumadin.
   Unclear if not currently taking Coumadin although patient states that
   she has been taking all home meds.
   - heparin gtt to bridge to Coumadin
   - Coumadin 5mg PO qday
   .
   5. Anxiety: Likely contributing to medical problems and may be etiology
   of admission.  Although pt states she is taking her current
   medications, does report increased anxiety which can lead to medication
   non-compliance and hypertension.  Pt recently saw psychiatrist who
   started her on Celexa.
   - continue Celexa 20mg PO qday
   - Ativan 1mg PO q8hours PRN
   - psych consult
   .
   6. Anemia: currently at baseline.  Likely related to ESRD.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   7. SLE:
   - continue Prednisone 20mg PO qday
   .
   8. FEN: regular diet, replete lytes PRN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   24yo F with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant hypertension presents with
   abdominal pain and headache this morning and admitted for hypertensive
   urgency.
   .
   1. Hypertensive Urgency: BP elevated on arrival to 260/130. Pt reports
   taking all medication as prescribed.  Differential includes
   hypertension secondary to abdominal pain, pheochromocytoma, [**Location (un) 6367**]
   disease.  Pt denies drug use including cocaine, amphetamines.  Had HD
   yesterday so volume overload is less likely.  Likely has an anxiety
   component precipitating hypertension.  Tox screen negative.
   - continue PO Labetolol 400mg TID, Hydralazine 100mg PO q8H, Nifedipine
   90mg PO qday, Clonidine
   - IV Hydralazine for goal BP < 180/100
   - serum metanephrines pending from last admission
   2. Abdominal Pain: Extensive prior workup unrevealing.  KUB done today
   without free air or evidence of SBO.  LFTs normal. Contributing to
   abdominal pain can be narcotic use, ascites with potential for SBP or
   infection.  Pt had recent CT scan which did not show source of
   abdominal pain. Cell counts show polys of 180.  Gram stain negative for
   organisms.
   - consider starting SBP treatment per renal; will f/u renal recs
   - consider pulling PD catheter depending on results and per renal team
   - per patient, pain best controlled with Dilaudid which she takes at
   home, will attempt PO Dilaudid to avoid addicting complications of IV
   Dilaudid
   .
   3. ESRD: HD yesterday. On T/Th/Sat schedule.  Pt currently undergoing
   HD due to recent ex-lap but was on PD prior to this and would like to
   go back to PD which can be done 3 weeks post-op per discharge summary.
   - HD today
   - renal following
   .
   4. Hx of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT: Pt is subtherapeutic on coumadin.
   Unclear if not currently taking Coumadin although patient states that
   she has been taking all home meds.
   - heparin gtt to bridge to Coumadin
   - Coumadin 5mg PO qday
   .
   5. Anxiety: Likely contributing to medical problems and may be etiology
   of admission.  Although pt states she is taking her current
   medications, does report increased anxiety which can lead to medication
   non-compliance and hypertension.  Pt recently saw psychiatrist who
   started her on Celexa.
   - continue Celexa 20mg PO qday
   - Ativan 1mg PO q8hours PRN
   - psych consult
   .
   6. Anemia: currently at baseline.  Likely related to ESRD.
   - continue to monitor

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with a complex medical history, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and a history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of hypertensive urgency.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 86 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 213/129 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 11 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient's physical examination is notable for a soft, non-tender abdomen, with bowel sounds present, and distended. Her extremities show trace edema.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 180 cells/μL
* Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 217 K/μL
* Creatinine: 4.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 6 mg/dL
* Sodium: 138 mmol/L
* Potassium: 5.1 mmol/L
* Chloride: 105 mmol/L
* Carbon dioxide: 30.4 mmol/L
* Anion gap: 5.8 mmol/L
* TropT: 0.07 ng/mL
* Glucose: 89 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.4 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she is being treated with oral and intravenous medications to control her hypertension.
2. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is thought to be related to her ESRD and may be exacerbated by her recent surgery. She is being treated with pain medication and is undergoing further evaluation to determine the cause of her pain.
3. ESRD: The patient is undergoing HD three times a week and is being monitored for any signs of complications.
4. Hx of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT: The patient is being treated with heparin to prevent further clotting.
5. Anxiety: The patient is being treated with anxiolytic medications and is undergoing further evaluation to determine the cause of her anxiety.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is thought to be related to her ESRD and is being monitored.
7. SLE: The patient is being treated with prednisone to manage her SLE.
8. FEN: The patient is being fed a regular diet and is being monitored for any signs of electrolyte imbalance.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she is at risk for developing a hypertensive emergency.
* Renal failure: The patient's ESRD increases her risk for developing acute kidney injury.
* DVT: The patient's history of DVT increases her risk for developing further clotting.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia increases her risk for developing complications such as heart failure and decreased oxygen delivery to her tissues.
* SLE: The patient's SLE increases her risk for developing complications such as nephritis and vasculitis.
* Anxiety: The patient's anxiety increases her risk for developing complications such as hypertension and tachycardia.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions that require close monitoring and management. Her potential medical complications are significant, and it is essential to continue to monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and overall clinical condition to prevent and manage these complications."

Summary:

The patient, a 24-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with hypertensive urgency. She has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on peritoneal dialysis. She was started on a dialysis catheter and is being treated with heparin sodium. Her blood pressure is still elevated, and she is being weaned off labetalol drip and transitioned to her home regimen with prn hydralazine. She has also been diagnosed with ascites and is at risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She is being treated with prednisone and is on immunosuppressive drugs.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive urgency: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and she is at risk for further complications such as cardiac arrest, stroke, and renal damage.
2. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD is a significant risk factor for further kidney damage, and she may require further dialysis or kidney transplantation.
3. Ascites: The patient's ascites is a risk factor for SBP, and she may require further treatment with antibiotics and drainage of the ascites.
4. SVC thrombosis: The patient's SVC thrombosis is a potential risk factor for pulmonary embolism and other complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to her ESRD and may require further treatment with blood transfusions or erythropoietin.
6. Depression: The patient's depression is a potential risk factor for poor outcomes and may require further treatment with antidepressant medications.
7. Infections: The patient's immunosuppressive medications and indwelling PD catheter make her at risk for infections, and she may require further treatment with antibiotics.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and ESRD make her at risk for cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrest, stroke, and heart failure.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old with a chief complaint of hypertensive urgency, complicated by renal failure, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The patient is currently on dialysis and has a history of abdominal pain and an indwelling peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter. The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, with a systolic pressure of 213 mmHg and a diastolic pressure of 129 mmHg. The patient is also experiencing ascites, which was drained and revealed a white blood cell count of 180. The patient's labs show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and magnesium, and decreased levels of hemoglobin and platelets.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, which may lead to a hypertensive crisis if not properly managed.
2. Renal failure: The patient's ESRD is likely to worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Sepsis: The patient's indwelling PD catheter and ascites increase the risk of sepsis, which may be exacerbated by the patient's immunosuppressed state due to SLE.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and ESRD increase the risk of cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's ascites and ESRD increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pleural effusions and respiratory failure.
6. Infection: The patient's indwelling PD catheter and ascites increase the risk of infection, which may be exacerbated by the patient's immunosuppressed state due to SLE.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient's ESRD and hypertension increase the risk of bleeding complications such as hematuria and epistaxis.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's ESRD and hypertension increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies such as anemia, which may be exacerbated by the patient's immunosuppressed state due to SLE.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue to monitor their blood pressure, renal function, and electrolyte levels closely, and to manage their hypertension and ESRD aggressively. The patient's indwelling PD catheter and ascites should be monitored closely for signs of infection or bleeding, and the patient should be counseled on the importance of adhering to their medication regimen and diet."

   Assessment and Plan
   24yo F with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant hypertension presented with
   abdominal pain and headache yesterday and was admitted for hypertensive
   urgency.
   .
   #1. Hypertensive Urgency: BP elevated on arrival to 260/130. Pt reports
   taking all medication as prescribed.  Differential includes
   hypertension secondary to abdominal pain, pheochromocytoma, [**Location (un) 6367**]
   disease.  Pt denies drug use including cocaine, amphetamines.  Had HD
   yesterday so volume overload is less likely.  Likely has an anxiety
   component precipitating hypertension.  Tox screen negative. Blood
   pressure improved during MICU stay, although morning blood pressures
   today were elevated before patient received inpatient meds.
   - continue PO Labetolol 400mg TID, Hydralazine 100mg PO q8H, Nifedipine
   90mg PO qday, Clonidine
   - attempt to wean Labetolol gtt
   - IV Hydralazine for goal BP < 180/100
   - follow serum metanephrines pending from last admission
   #2Headache: R sided HA for several weeks, radiates to R jaw where
   patient had previous tooth extraction. Neg head ct, no focal neuro
   findings.  No visual deficits. HA did not improve w/blood pressure
   control so likely not part of hypertensive disease.
   -          Tylenol, PO dilaudid for pain.
   -          Consider neuro outpatient for HA management
   -          UE U/s (b/c of Hx of UE DVT and appears to have facial
   swelling)
   -          Thorough dental exam
   .
   #3. Abdominal Pain: Resolved this am.  Extensive prior workup
   unrevealing.  KUB done today without free air or evidence of SBO.  LFTs
   normal. Contributing to abdominal pain can be narcotic use, ascites
   with potential for SBP or infection.  Pt had recent CT scan which did
   not show source of abdominal pain. Cell counts show polys of 180.  Gram
   stain negative for organisms.
   - renal did not recommend SBP treatment, should not pull PD catheter at
   this time.
   - per patient, pain best controlled with Dilaudid which she takes at
   home, will attempt PO Dilaudid to avoid addicting complications of IV
   Dilaudid
   .
   #4. ESRD: On T/Th/Sat HD schedule.  Pt currently undergoing HD due to
   recent ex-lap but was on PD prior to this and would like to go back to
   PD which can be done 3 weeks post-op per discharge summary.
   - HD yesterday
   - renal following
   .
   4. Hx of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT: Pt is subtherapeutic on coumadin.
   Unclear if not currently taking Coumadin although patient states that
   she has been taking all home meds. Heparin gtt to bridge to Coumadin ->
   suptratherapeutic PTT.
   -d/c heparin (risk of hypertensive ich)
   - Coumadin 5mg PO qday
   .
   5. Anxiety: Likely contributing to medical problems and may be etiology
   of admission.  Although pt states she is taking her current
   medications, does report increased anxiety which can lead to medication
   non-compliance and hypertension.  Pt recently saw psychiatrist who
   started her on Celexa.
   - continue Celexa 20mg PO qday
   - Ativan 1mg PO q8hours PRN
   - psych consult
   .
   6. Anemia: currently at baseline.  Likely related to ESRD.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   7. SLE:
   - continue Prednisone 20mg PO qday
   .
   8. FEN: regular diet, replete lytes PRN
   .
   9. Prophylaxis: Heparin gtt d/c, no need for ulcer prophylaxis at this
   time, bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and hypertension. She was admitted for hypertensive urgency and presented with abdominal pain and headache. Her blood pressure is still elevated, and she is being treated with a combination of oral and IV medications. She has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently on heparin therapy. She is also taking medications for anxiety and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and she is at risk for a hypertensive crisis, which could lead to cardiac complications, stroke, or other serious medical issues.
2. Volume Overload: The patient had hemodialysis (HD) yesterday, and there is a risk of volume overload, which could exacerbate her hypertension and other medical conditions.
3. Infection: The patient's abdominal pain is still unresolved, and there is a risk of infection, particularly with the presence of a PD catheter.
4. Thrombosis: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on heparin therapy. There is a risk of thrombosis, particularly with the presence of a PD catheter.
5. Narcotic Dependence: The patient is taking Dilaudid for pain management, and there is a risk of narcotic dependence and addiction.
6. Anxiety and Depression: The patient has a history of anxiety and depression, and these conditions could exacerbate her medical issues and impact her mental health.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour ICU admission with a history of deep vein thrombosis, chronic pain, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure range of 150's-160's/80's-100's mmHg, and a heart rate of 77-114 bpm. The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion and is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, and mild elevation of creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits, and the platelet count is slightly elevated.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the noted changes in laboratory results. The patient's physical examination is not fully assessed due to the patient's lack of response to stimuli.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's history of hypertension and recent blood pressure readings in the 150's-160's/80's-100's mmHg range suggest that the patient is at risk for hypertensive crisis.
2. Renal failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease and elevated creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL suggest that the patient is at risk for further renal failure.
3. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's history of deep vein thrombosis and the presence of a dialysis catheter suggest that the patient is at risk for further deep vein thrombosis.
4. Infection: The patient's lack of response to stimuli and the presence of a dialysis catheter suggest that the patient is at risk for infection.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's lack of nutrition and the presence of a dialysis catheter suggest that the patient is at risk for malnutrition.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level of 89 mg/dL suggests that the patient is at risk for hypoglycemia.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent hypertensive crisis.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent further renal failure.
3. Monitor the patient's dialysis catheter site for signs of infection and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's nutrition closely and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent malnutrition.
5. Monitor the patient's glucose level closely and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent hypoglycemia.
6. Consider a psych consult to address the patient's coping mechanisms and stress levels."

   Assessment and Plan
   24yo F with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant hypertension presents with
   abdominal pain and headache this morning and admitted for hypertensive
   urgency.
   .
   1. Hypertensive Urgency: BP elevated on arrival to 260/130. Pt reports
   taking all medication as prescribed.  Differential includes
   hypertension secondary to abdominal pain, pheochromocytoma, [**Location (un) 6367**]
   disease.  Pt denies drug use including cocaine, amphetamines.  Had HD
   yesterday so volume overload is less likely.  Likely has an anxiety
   component precipitating hypertension.  Tox screen negative.
   - continue PO Labetolol 400mg TID, Hydralazine 100mg PO q8H, Nifedipine
   90mg PO qday, Clonidine
   - attempt to wean Labetolol gtt
   - IV Hydralazine for goal BP < 180/100
   - serum metanephrines pending from last admission
   .
   2. Abdominal Pain: Extensive prior workup unrevealing.  KUB done today
   without free air or evidence of SBO.  LFTs normal. Contributing to
   abdominal pain can be narcotic use, ascites with potential for SBP or
   infection.  Pt had recent CT scan which did not show source of
   abdominal pain. Cell counts show polys of 180.  Gram stain negative for
   organisms.
   - consider starting SBP treatment per renal; will f/u renal recs
   - consider pulling PD catheter depending on results and per renal team
   - per patient, pain best controlled with Dilaudid which she takes at
   home, will attempt PO Dilaudid to avoid addicting complications of IV

   Assessment and Plan
   24yo F with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant hypertension presents with
   abdominal pain and headache this morning and admitted for hypertensive
   urgency.
   .
   1. Hypertensive Urgency: BP elevated on arrival to 260/130. Pt reports
   taking all medication as prescribed.  Differential includes
   hypertension secondary to abdominal pain, pheochromocytoma, [**Location (un) 6367**]
   disease.  Pt denies drug use including cocaine, amphetamines.  Had HD
   yesterday so volume overload is less likely.  Likely has an anxiety
   component precipitating hypertension.  Tox screen negative.
   - continue PO Labetolol 400mg TID, Hydralazine 100mg PO q8H, Nifedipine
   90mg PO qday, Clonidine
   - attempt to wean Labetolol gtt
   - IV Hydralazine for goal BP < 180/100
   - serum metanephrines pending from last admission
   .
   2. Abdominal Pain: Extensive prior workup unrevealing.  KUB done today
   without free air or evidence of SBO.  LFTs normal. Contributing to
   abdominal pain can be narcotic use, ascites with potential for SBP or
   infection.  Pt had recent CT scan which did not show source of
   abdominal pain. Cell counts show polys of 180.  Gram stain negative for
   organisms.
   - consider starting SBP treatment per renal; will f/u renal recs
   - consider pulling PD catheter depending on results and per renal team
   - per patient, pain best controlled with Dilaudid which she takes at
   home, will attempt PO Dilaudid to avoid addicting complications of IV
   Dilaudid
   .
   3. ESRD: HD yesterday. On T/Th/Sat schedule.  Pt currently undergoing
   HD due to recent ex-lap but was on PD prior to this and would like to
   go back to PD which can be done 3 weeks post-op per discharge summary.
   - HD today
   - renal following
   .
   4. Hx of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT: Pt is subtherapeutic on coumadin.
   Unclear if not currently taking Coumadin although patient states that
   she has been taking all home meds.
   - heparin gtt to bridge to Coumadin
   - Coumadin 5mg PO qday
   .
   5. Anxiety: Likely contributing to medical problems and may be etiology
   of admission.  Although pt states she is taking her current
   medications, does report increased anxiety which can lead to medication
   non-compliance and hypertension.  Pt recently saw psychiatrist who
   started her on Celexa.
   - continue Celexa 20mg PO qday
   - Ativan 1mg PO q8hours PRN
   - psych consult
   .
   6. Anemia: currently at baseline.  Likely related to ESRD.
   - continue to monitor

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old woman with SLE, ESRD on HD, and malignant hypertension who was admitted for hypertensive urgency. She presents with abdominal pain and headache. Her blood pressure is controlled, and she is being treated with PO Labetolol, Hydralazine, Nifedipine, and Clonidine. She also has ascites with potential for SBP or infection, which is being monitored. She has a history of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT and is subtherapeutic on Coumadin. She is also being treated for anxiety and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and there is a risk of hypertensive crisis if it is not controlled.
2. Sepsis: The patient has ascites with potential for SBP or infection, which can lead to sepsis.
3. DVT/PE: The patient has a history of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT and is subtherapeutic on Coumadin, which increases the risk of DVT/PE.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to ESRD and may worsen if not properly managed.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's abdominal pain and ascites may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient's hypertension and ascites may lead to respiratory complications such as respiratory failure.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's hypertension and ascites may lead to neurological complications such as stroke or seizures.
8. Infection: The patient's ascites and history of SLE increase the risk of infection, particularly peritonitis.
9. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's ascites and history of SLE increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Overall, the patient is at risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with a chief complaint of malignant hypertension. She has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). She is currently in the ICU for hypertensive crisis and hypertensive emergency.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Heart rate: 77 bpm (normal range: 60-100 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 155/89 mmHg (normal range: 90-140/60-90 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute (normal range: 12-20 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 100% (normal range: 95-100%)

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Facial asymmetry with right greater than left facial swelling
* Soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present
* No edema in the extremities
* Warm skin
* Neurologically intact with normal strength and EOMI (eyes, ocular movements intact)

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.3 g/dL (normal range: 12-16 g/dL)
* White blood cell count: 5.8 K/uL (normal range: 4.5-11.0 K/uL)
* Platelet count: 217 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 4.5 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* TropT: 0.07 (normal range: <0.1)
* Glucose: 89 mg/dL (normal range: 70-110 mg/dL)

The patient's medical history includes deep venous thrombosis (DVT), chronic pain, hypertension, and ESRD. She has a history of SLE and is currently taking prednisone 20 mg for SLE, Celexa for depression, and coumadin with bridging heparin for SVC thrombosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Hypertensive crisis and hypertensive emergency: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and there is a risk of further complications if not managed properly.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is a risk of further kidney damage if not managed properly.
3. Deep venous thrombosis: The patient has a history of DVT and is currently at risk of further thrombotic events.
4. SVC thrombosis: The patient has a history of SVC thrombosis and is at risk of further thrombotic events.
5. Headache: The patient's headache is not fully explained and may be related to migraines, dental abscess, or SVC syndrome.
6. Pain: The patient has chronic pain and is at risk of further pain exacerbation.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to ESRD and may require further management.

Based on the patient's condition, it is recommended that she continue to receive close monitoring and management in the ICU. The patient's blood pressure should be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications. The patient's creatinine level should be closely monitored to prevent further kidney damage. The patient's DVT and SVC thrombosis should be closely monitored to prevent further thrombotic events. The patient's headache and pain should be closely monitored and managed to prevent further exacerbation. The patient's anemia should be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of malignant hypertension. They have a history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), upper extremity chronic pain, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a blood pressure of 155/89 mmHg and a heart rate of 77 bpm. They are receiving various medications, including antihypertensives, anticoagulants, and pain management medications. The patient's laboratory results show evidence of renal failure, with a creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 27.5 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and they may be at risk for further hypertensive complications, such as cardiac arrest, stroke, or kidney damage.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating impaired kidney function. This may lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and anemia.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT, and their current condition may increase their risk for further clot formation.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is not well-documented, but their oxygen saturation level is 100%, which may indicate some degree of respiratory compromise.
5. Infection: The patient has an indwelling catheter and is receiving antibiotics, which may increase their risk for catheter-associated urinary tract infections or other infections.
6. Pain management: The patient is receiving pain management medications, but their chronic pain may not be adequately controlled, which could lead to further complications.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and they may be at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring their vital signs, laboratory results, and medication regimen closely to prevent further deterioration and optimize their care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old with a chief complaint of malignant hypertension, who has been admitted to the ICU due to hypertensive crisis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), hypertension, and chronic pain. They have undergone several procedures, including a laparoscopic surgery for free air and have an indwelling peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter.

The patient's current vital signs are: temperature 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate 77 bpm, blood pressure 155/89 mmHg, respiratory rate 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%. The patient is receiving several medications, including labetalol, hydralazine, and clonidine.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, indicating end-stage renal disease. The patient's white blood cell count is 5.8 K/μL, and their platelet count is 217 K/μL. The patient's troponin-T level is 0.07 ng/mL, and their CK/CKMB levels are 33/0.07 IU/L.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease (ESRD) increases the risk of further renal damage and the need for dialysis.
2. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's malignant hypertension can lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrest, stroke, and renal failure.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of DVT and chronic pain increases the risk of recurrent DVT and pulmonary embolism.
4. Infection: The patient's indwelling PD catheter and recent surgical procedures increase the risk of infection.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 100% indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of hypertension and cardiac disease increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of abdominal pain and ascites increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's history of SLE and chronic pain increases the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures and stroke."
