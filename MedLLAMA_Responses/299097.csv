You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities, including VRE bacteremia, acute renal failure, pancytopenia, and altered mental status. The patient is currently receiving CVVH, insulin drip, and antibiotics, and is being monitored for hyperglycemia and potential ATN.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has VRE bacteremia, which increases the risk of developing sepsis, a life-threatening condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to an infection.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may progress to AKI, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of mortality.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's pancytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly with invasive procedures or anticoagulant therapy.
4. Infections: The patient's immunocompromised state may increase the risk of developing secondary infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or other opportunistic infections.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure, particularly if there is a delay in recognizing and treating underlying respiratory issues.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may progress to more severe neurological deficits, including seizures, coma, or brain death.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's immunocompromised state and use of antibiotics may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, including Clostridioides difficile infection or antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
9. Thrombotic complications: The patient's pancytopenia may increase the risk of thrombotic complications, including deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

Given the patient's critical illness and complex medical conditions, close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

   Renal function improved significantly over past 36 hours. Significant
   negative fluid balance with CVVH.
   Mental status better this morning; patient able to follow simple
   commands.
   Patient has respiratory alkalosis, possibly related to discomfort. She
   has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is probably a
   compensation for the respiratory alkalosis. No diarrhea. Oxygenation in
   good range.
   Insulin being adjusted to maintain serum glucose in range.
   Blood pressure remains high on hydralazine. Check with renal about
   using IV ACE inhibitor. If that is not an option, consider clonidine
   patch.
   Continues with abdominal pain, likely from the VOD. Checking stool for
   C diff. Bilirubin continues to rise. Will ask liver service to consult.
   LDH up; check smear for schistocytes.
   Continue to support blood counts with transfusions per protocol.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   compensation for the respiratory alkalosis. No diarrhea. Oxygenation in
   good range.
   Insulin being adjusted to maintain serum glucose in range.
   Blood pressure remains high on hydralazine. Check with renal about
   using IV ACE inhibitor. If that is not an option, consider clonidine

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with pancytopenia, occlusive disease, bacteremia, and hyperglycemia. They have been receiving treatment for their condition, including transfusions, antibiotics, and insulin infusion. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, and blood pressure of 155/87 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy and have a SpO2 of 95%. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 17 inspirations per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show that they have a white blood cell count of 0.2 K/uL, a platelet count of 20 K/uL, and a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL. Their electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a potassium level of 19 mEq/L. The patient's liver function tests show elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase, ALT, and AST. Their renal function tests show a creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen level of 28.9 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show a probable right pleural effusion and no free air under the diaphragm. The patient's abdominal exam shows tenderness in the right upper quadrant and bilateral pedal edema.

Potential medical complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential kidney damage. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration of dialysis may be necessary.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and they are receiving oxygen therapy. Close monitoring of respiratory status and consideration of mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
3. Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia and is receiving antibiotics. Close monitoring of infection status and consideration of additional antibiotics may be necessary.
4. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests show elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase, ALT, and AST. Close monitoring of liver function and consideration of liver transplantation may be necessary.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's platelet count is low, and they are receiving anticoagulant therapy. Close monitoring of bleeding status and consideration of platelet transfusions may be necessary.
6. Infection: The patient has a probable right pleural effusion and is at risk for infection. Close monitoring of infection status and consideration of antibiotics may be necessary.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving nutrition through a central line, and close monitoring of nutritional status and consideration of enteral nutrition may be necessary.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and they are receiving antihypertensive therapy. Close monitoring of cardiovascular status and consideration of additional antihypertensive therapy may be necessary."

   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 7.7 L off yesterday, total of 2.6L negative in 24 hours.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS 69 this morning, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. On floor, pt's FSBG were
   consistenly over 400. Pt was initially started on an insulin gtt that
   was d/c
d yesterday/ Following a returning of CBGs above her goal of
   100-151 pt was restarted on Insulin IV gtt [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs. Will
   following insulin gtt requirement with the goal of titrating up the
   Lantus dose.  Lantus was held this morning with goal of adding up total
   insulin gtt requirement and adding [**Last Name (un) 3384**] to her lantus.  Likely had poor
   sq absorption of insulin so will be difficult to titrate
   - will increase lantus per insulin gtt requirement over last 24 hours
   and transition to SSI
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +18 post cord stem cell transplant.  ANC this
   morning
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   -
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Plt did not
   bump appropriately last night after 2 units (13-
13) but at 27 this
   morning.  Discussed possiblity of plt antibody with transfusion
   medicine
 given bump to 27, less concerning for it.  Advised that to
   get an accurate plt count it must be drawn 15-30 minutes after
   transfusion which we have not been doing.
   -transfusion medicine to discuss plt goal with heme/onc
 who needs to
   discuss with principle investigator of study to determine bottom limit
   of acceptable plt count
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>30 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. Her
   hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt unfortunately
   does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer acting
   antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.  Was started on labetalol gtt
   yesterday which controlled bp
s well, has not required it this morning
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in the low 100s, pt
   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a
   sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low threhold and obtain
   surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures were drawn three
   days ago.
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 7.7 L off yesterday, total of 2.6L negative in 24 hours.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS 69 this morning, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. On floor, pt's FSBG were
   consistenly over 400. Pt was initially started on an insulin gtt that
   was d/c
d yesterday/ Following a returning of CBGs above her goal of
   100-151 pt was restarted on Insulin IV gtt [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs. Will
   following insulin gtt requirement with the goal of titrating up the
   Lantus dose.  Lantus was held this morning with goal of adding up total
   insulin gtt requirement and adding [**Last Name (un) 3384**] to her lantus.  Likely had poor
   sq absorption of insulin so will be difficult to titrate
   - will increase lantus per insulin gtt requirement over last 24 hours
   and transition to SSI
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +18 post cord stem cell transplant.  ANC this
   morning
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   -
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Plt did not
   bump appropriately last night after 2 units (13-
13) but at 27 this
   morning.  Discussed possiblity of plt antibody with transfusion
   medicine
 given bump to 27, less concerning for it.  Advised that to
   get an accurate plt count it must be drawn 15-30 minutes after
   transfusion which we have not been doing.
   -transfusion medicine to discuss plt goal with heme/onc
 who needs to
   discuss with principle investigator of study to determine bottom limit
   of acceptable plt count
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>30 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. Her
   hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt unfortunately
   does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer acting
   antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.  Was started on labetalol gtt
   yesterday which controlled bp
s well, has not required it this morning
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in the low 100s, pt
   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a
   sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low threhold and obtain
   surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures were drawn three
   days ago.
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - surveillance cx
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no(diarrhea and abdominal pain),

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood transplantation. She was transferred to the ICU for initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia. The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, presumed VOD, hypertension, and C. difficile colitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Renal failure: The patient is already experiencing acute renal failure, and the CRRT may not be effective in managing her condition. There is a risk of further renal damage or failure.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are not well-controlled, and there is a risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and there is a risk of bleeding or bleeding complications.
4. Presumed VOD: The patient has symptoms of VOD, including RUQ pain, ascites, and reversal of flow in the portal system. There is a risk of further liver damage or failure.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is not well-controlled, and there is a risk of developing hypertension-related complications, such as cardiovascular disease or stroke.
6. C. difficile colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, and there is a risk of recurrence or further complications.
7. Line infection: The patient has multiple lines in place, including a PICC line, midline, and dialysis catheter. There is a risk of line infection or sepsis.
8. Mucositis: The patient has mucositis, which can lead to further complications, such as infection or bleeding.
9. Intragluteal folds rash: The patient has an intragluteal folds rash, which may be a sign of an allergic reaction or infection.
10. Nausea and vomiting: The patient has nausea and vomiting, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and other complications.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for developing further medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

   Chief Complaint: Initiation of CRRT
   24 Hour Events:
   - INR 1.8, patient given another 1 unit of FFP and 10 mg IV K. Per heme
   onc needs q6h coags and fibrinogen until this is stable and INR > 1.5
   needs to be corrected with FFP.
   - Given hypertension she was started on a labetolol gtt per renal recs.
   - Tac level was 10.2
   - CXR and AXR this am sent for nonspecific pain showed: CXR - no free
   air is detected beneath the diaphragm. Although slightly blurred, the
   visualized bowel loops are grossly unremarkable. A small right
   pleural effusion is seen, similar to that seen on the chest x-ray from
   [**2149-2-7**].
   - ID had no changes in their recs.
   - Heme/onc had no changes in their recs.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] agreed with plan to increase lantus so that the insulin gtt
   could be weaned off.
   - C.diff x 2 pending and 1 C.diff negative; BCx NGTD.
   - Plt count did not bump at all to plt transfusion at 10 pm med
   dosing.  BMT fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] and said to give plt again with next
   infusion and if still not bumping, check with the blood bank in the am
   about the possibility of plt antibodies.  Was given 2 units of platlets
   after plt at recheck were 13 and post transfusion plt count was ***.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: Initiation of CRRT
   24 Hour Events:
   - INR 1.8, patient given another 1 unit of FFP and 10 mg IV K. Per heme
   onc needs q6h coags and fibrinogen until this is stable and INR > 1.5
   needs to be corrected with FFP.
   - Given hypertension she was started on a labetolol gtt per renal recs.
   - Tac level was 10.2
   - CXR and AXR this am sent for nonspecific pain showed: CXR - no free
   air is detected beneath the diaphragm. Although slightly blurred, the
   visualized bowel loops are grossly unremarkable. A small right
   pleural effusion is seen, similar to that seen on the chest x-ray from
   [**2149-2-7**].
   - ID had no changes in their recs.
   - Heme/onc had no changes in their recs.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] agreed with plan to increase lantus so that the insulin gtt
   could be weaned off.
   - C.diff x 2 pending and 1 C.diff negative; BCx NGTD.
   - Plt count did not bump at all to plt transfusion at 10 pm med
   dosing.  BMT fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] and said to give plt again with next
   infusion and if still not bumping, check with the blood bank in the am
   about the possibility of plt antibodies.  Was given 2 units of platlets
   after plt at recheck were 13 and post transfusion plt count was ***.

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood transplantation. She was transferred to the ICU for initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia. The patient has developed acute renal failure, presumed to be due to a combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. She has also developed hypertension, hyperglycemia, and presumed VOD.

The patient's current medications include insulin IV gtt, Lantus, Tacrolimus, Cellcept, Solumedrol, Lasix, and thiazides. She is also receiving CRRT, defibrotide, and vancomycin.

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 0.3
* Hct: 27.2
* Plt: 13
* Cr: 1.1
* TCO2: 19
* Glucose: 148
* INR: 1.8
* PT/PTT: 19.7/41.9

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 36.2°C
* Tcurrent: 34.7°C
* HR: 76 bpm
* BP: 114/60 mmHg
* RR: 16 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 96%

Potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis and is currently receiving antibiotics. She also has a PICC line and a dialysis catheter, which increases her risk of infection.
2. Bleeding: The patient has thrombocytopenia and is receiving anticoagulation therapy. This increases her risk of bleeding.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is presumed to be due to Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. She is receiving CRRT, which may help to manage her renal failure.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is likely due to Tacro toxicity. She is receiving antihypertensive medications, including Hydralazine and Labetolol.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is likely due to Solumedrol. She is receiving insulin IV gtt and Lantus to manage her hyperglycemia.
6. VOD: The patient's presumed VOD is likely due to Tacro toxicity. She is receiving defibrotide to manage her VOD.
7. Mucositis: The patient has mucositis, which is likely due to her chemotherapy treatment. She is receiving supportive care and pain regimen to manage her mucositis.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's condition is stable, but she is at risk for several potential complications. She will require close monitoring of her vital signs, lab results, and medication regimen. She will also require regular assessments of her renal function, bleeding risk, and infection risk."

   Chief Complaint: Initiation of CRRT
   24 Hour Events:
   - INR 1.8, patient given another 1 unit of FFP and 10 mg IV K. Per heme
   onc needs q6h coags and fibrinogen until this is stable and INR > 1.5
   needs to be corrected with FFP.
   - Given hypertension she was started on a labetolol gtt per renal recs.
   - Tac level was 10.2
   - CXR and AXR this am sent for nonspecific pain showed: CXR - no free
   air is detected beneath the diaphragm. Although slightly blurred, the
   visualized bowel loops are grossly unremarkable. A small right
   pleural effusion is seen, similar to that seen on the chest x-ray from
   [**2149-2-7**].
   - ID had no changes in their recs.
   - Heme/onc had no changes in their recs.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] agreed with plan to increase lantus so that the insulin gtt
   could be weaned off.
   - C.diff x 2 pending and 1 C.diff negative; BCx NGTD.
   - Plt count did not bump at all to plt transfusion at 10 pm med
   dosing.  BMT fellow was contact[**Name (NI) **] and said to give plt again with next
   infusion and if still not bumping, check with the blood bank in the am

 [**Last Name **] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 LYMPHOMA (CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM, LYMPHOID)
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, now transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 7.7 L off yesterday, total of 2.6L negative in 24 hours.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - will discuss possibiilty of CVVH on floor
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS 69 this morning, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. On floor, pt's FSBG were
   consistenly over 400. Pt was initially started on an insulin gtt that
   was d/c
d yesterday/ Following a returning of CBGs above her goal of
   100-151 pt was restarted on Insulin IV gtt [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs. Will
   following insulin gtt requirement with the goal of titrating up the
   Lantus dose.  Lantus was held this morning with goal of adding up total
   insulin gtt requirement and adding [**Last Name (un) 3384**] to her lantus.  Likely had poor
   sq absorption of insulin so will be difficult to titrate
   - continue insulin gtt, titrate to FSBG 100-151, FS Q1 H, will monitor
   insulin requirements to eventually wean of insulin gtt whilst
   increasing Lantus as above
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +18 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   -
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Plt did not
   bump appropriately last night after 2 units (13-
13) but at 27 this
   morning.  Discussed possiblity of plt antibody with transfusion
   medicine
 given bump to 27, less concerning for it.  Advised that to
   get an accurate plt count it must be drawn 15-30 minutes after
   transfusion which we have not been doing.
   -transfusion medicine to discuss plt goal with heme/onc
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>30 and hct >30
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. Her
   hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt unfortunately
   does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer acting
   antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.  Was started on labetalol gtt
   yesterday which controlled bp
s well, has not required it
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in the low 100s, pt
   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a
   sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low threhold and obtain
   surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures were drawn three
   days ago.
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - surveillance cx
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no(diarrhea and abdominal pain),
   currently one C. diff has been sent yesterday.
   - was on PO vancomycin, now on Flagyl
   - f/u c.diff assay
   - continue contact precautions
    # Diastolic HTN starting [**1-24**] likely [**3-3**] to Tacro toxicity
   - will monitor BP closely during CRRT
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # ? Line infection:
   - Cont daptomycin and zosyn
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid PCA

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, now transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 7.7 L off yesterday, total of 2.6L negative in 24 hours.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - will discuss possibiilty of CVVH on floor
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS 69 this morning, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. On floor, pt's FSBG were
   consistenly over 400. Pt was initially started on an insulin gtt that
   was d/c
d yesterday/ Following a returning of CBGs above her goal of
   100-151 pt was restarted on Insulin IV gtt [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs. Will
   following insulin gtt requirement with the goal of titrating up the
   Lantus dose.  Lantus was held this morning with goal of adding up total
   insulin gtt requirement and adding [**Last Name (un) 3384**] to her lantus.  Likely had poor
   sq absorption of insulin so will be difficult to titrate
   - continue insulin gtt, titrate to FSBG 100-151, FS Q1 H, will monitor
   insulin requirements to eventually wean of insulin gtt whilst
   increasing Lantus as above
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +18 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   -
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Plt did not
   bump appropriately last night after 2 units (13-
13) but at 27 this
   morning.  Discussed possiblity of plt antibody with transfusion
   medicine
 given bump to 27, less concerning for it.  Advised that to
   get an accurate plt count it must be drawn 15-30 minutes after
   transfusion which we have not been doing.
   -transfusion medicine to discuss plt goal with heme/onc
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>30 and hct >30
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. Her
   hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt unfortunately
   does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer acting
   antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.  Was started on labetalol gtt
   yesterday which controlled bp
s well, has not required it
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in the low 100s, pt
   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a
   sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low threhold and obtain
   surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures were drawn three
   days ago.
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - surveillance cx
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no(diarrhea and abdominal pain),
   currently one C. diff has been sent yesterday.
   - was on PO vancomycin, now on Flagyl
   - f/u c.diff assay
   - continue contact precautions
    # Diastolic HTN starting [**1-24**] likely [**3-3**] to Tacro toxicity
   - will monitor BP closely during CRRT

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood transplantation. She was transferred to the ICU for initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is requiring CRRT. The likely etiology of ARF is a combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are consistently above 400 mg/dL. She was initially started on an insulin gtt, but it was discontinued due to poor absorption. She is currently on an insulin gtt with a goal of titrating up the Lantus dose.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is persistently low, likely due to chemotherapy. She did not respond to a recent platelet transfusion and may have platelet antibodies.
4. Presumed VOD: The patient has RUQ pain, ascites, and a question of reversal of flow in the portal system, which is consistent with VOD. She is being treated with defibrotide.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she is being treated with hydralazine. Her blood pressure goals are SBP 130-150.
6. Fevers: The patient had a fever, which resolved after the removal of her IJ line. She is currently on vancomycin and zosyn.
7. C. difficile colitis: The patient has had no symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal pain, but one C. diff assay is pending.
8. Mucositis: The patient has mucositis, which is slowing improving.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and hypertension.
2. Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppressive therapy and fevers.
3. Increased risk of VOD progression.
4. Increased risk of ARF progression.
5. Increased risk of hyperglycemia complications, such as ketoacidosis.
6. Increased risk of hypertension complications, such as cardiac failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue CRRT and monitor for signs of ARF progression.
2. Continue insulin gtt and titrate up the Lantus dose as needed.
3. Monitor platelet count and transfuse as needed.
4. Continue defibrotide and monitor for signs of VOD progression.
5. Continue antihypertensive therapy and monitor blood pressure.
6. Continue febrile management and monitor for signs of infection.
7. Continue C. difficile colitis treatment and monitor for symptoms.
8. Continue mucositis management and monitor for signs of improvement.

The patient's code status is full code, and she is being cared for in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU patient with a history of lymphoma, who underwent cord stem cell transplantation (SCT) 18 days prior. They are currently experiencing acute renal failure, acute pain, hyperglycemia, lymphoma, hyperbilirubinemia, pancytopenia, neutropenic fever, and VRE infection. They are receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and hyperglycemia control. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.3°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/79 mmHg. They are receiving mechanical ventilation and have a SpO2 of 96%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as a low white blood cell count and platelet count.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney damage. This may lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and potentially life-threatening complications if left untreated.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, which may lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, or other complications if not managed properly.
3. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count and platelet count may increase their risk of infection and bleeding, respectively.
4. Neutropenic fever: The patient's low white blood cell count may increase their risk of developing a life-threatening infection.
5. VRE infection: The patient's VRE infection may lead to sepsis, organ failure, and potentially life-threatening complications if not treated promptly and effectively.
6. Lymphoma: The patient's lymphoma may relapse or progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.
7. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's elevated bilirubin levels may indicate liver damage or dysfunction, which may lead to jaundice, pruritus, and potentially life-threatening complications if left untreated.
8. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressure may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, stroke, or kidney damage, if left untreated.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring their vital signs, laboratory results, and treatment plan closely. The patient's medical team should also consider adjusting their treatment plan to address any emerging complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old post-cord stem cell transplant (SCT) recipient with a diagnosis of acute renal failure, lymphoma, and other underlying medical conditions. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for various complications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.3°C, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 131/79 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 96% on room air, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.45, pCO2 of 31 mmHg, and pO2 of 78 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 0.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 27 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a potassium level of 3.7 mEq/L. The patient's liver function tests show elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin, and their lactate level is elevated at 1.9 mmol/L.

The patient is being treated with a variety of medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and pain medications. They are also receiving insulin infusions to manage their hyperglycemia.

The patient's medical history is significant for lymphoma, and they have undergone a cord SCT. They are at risk for developing veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and are being monitored closely for this complication.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's neutropenic fever and elevated lactate level suggest a high risk of developing sepsis.
2. VOD: The patient's history of cord SCT and elevated bilirubin level put them at risk for developing VOD.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if they do not receive adequate treatment.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may lead to further complications if not managed properly.
5. Infection: The patient's neutropenic fever and elevated lactate level suggest a high risk of developing infections.
6. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase their risk of bleeding.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not managed properly.
8. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver function tests suggest a high risk of developing liver failure.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple underlying medical conditions and potential complications. It is essential to closely monitor their condition and adjust their treatment plan as needed to prevent further complications."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - per transfusion medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn,
   recommended that we shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets
   are transfused - anything after that will definitely be lower.  Could
   also check a panel reactive antibody (did not do).  Can also transfuse
   'O' platelets if concerned (did not do)
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   - hct goal remains around 30 - but we should base it on her fluid
   status as well
   - plt count at 5pm was 15, got one unit along with her 8pm dose of
   Defibrotide
   - hct at 5pm was 33
   - renal recs to continues CVVH
   - patient with only minimal agitation - managed well with pain
   medication and ativan

   following insulin gtt requirement with the goal of titrating up the
   Lantus dose.  Lantus was held this morning with goal of adding up total
   insulin gtt requirement and adding [**Last Name (un) 3384**] to her lantus.  Likely had poor
   sq absorption of insulin so will be difficult to titrate
   - will increase lantus per insulin gtt requirement over last 24 hours
   and transition to SSI
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +18 post cord stem cell transplant.  ANC this
   morning
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily

   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Plt did not
   bump appropriately last night after 2 units (13-
13) but at 27 this
   morning.  Discussed possiblity of plt antibody with transfusion
   medicine
 given bump to 27, less concerning for it.  Advised that to
   get an accurate plt count it must be drawn 15-30 minutes after
   transfusion which we have not been doing.
   -transfusion medicine to discuss plt goal with heme/onc
 who needs to
   discuss with principle investigator of study to determine bottom limit
   of acceptable plt count
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of

   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>30 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. Her
   hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt unfortunately
   does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer acting
   antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.  Was started on labetalol gtt
   yesterday which controlled bp
s well, has not required it this morning
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in the low 100s, pt
   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a
   sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low threhold and obtain
   surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures were drawn three
   days ago.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - per transfusion medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn,
   recommended that we shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets
   are transfused - anything after that will definitely be lower.  Could
   also check a panel reactive antibody (did not do).  Can also transfuse
   'O' platelets if concerned (did not do)
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   - hct goal remains around 30 - but we should base it on her fluid
   status as well
   - plt count at 5pm was 15, got one unit along with her 8pm dose of
   Defibrotide
   - hct at 5pm was 33
   - renal recs to continues CVVH
   - patient with only minimal agitation - managed well with pain
   medication and ativan
   - Lantus increased to 50 units qd, off insulin gtt, on humalog sliding
   scale with q2h fingersticks and q6h SSI dosing per endocrine

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who underwent ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood transplantation. She was transferred to the ICU for initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Renal function: The patient has acute kidney injury (ARF) and is receiving CRRT. She has a history of sedimentation c/w ATN, and the most likely etiology is a combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been consistently above 100-151, and she was started on an insulin gtt. Her current goal is to maintain a blood glucose level of 100-151.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is persistently low, likely due to chemotherapy. She has received two units of platelets, but her platelet count did not increase as expected. The possibility of platelet antibody was discussed with transfusion medicine.
* Presumed VOD: The patient has RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of flow in the portal system. She was started on defibrotide.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently controlled with hydralazine, but she does not take POs. Other options for antihypertensive regimens include Clonidine patch and ACEI IV.
* Fevers: The patient had been afebrile for 24 hours, but started to develop fever again. She was started on vancomycin and cefepime, and her IJ line was removed due to suspicion of line contamination.
* C. difficile colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis and is currently on Flagyl.
* Mucositis: The patient has mucositis, which is slowing improving.
* Intragluteal folds rash: The patient has an intragluteal folds rash, which is unlikely to be fungal.
* Nausea: The patient has nausea, which is being managed with antiemetics.
* Bone pain: The patient has bone pain, which is being managed with Dilaudid.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Further deterioration of renal function
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Increased risk of VOD progression
* Increased risk of hypertension complications
* Development of C. difficile colitis
* Development of mucositis
* Development of skin rash
* Development of nausea and vomiting
* Development of bone pain

The patient's current medications include:

* Lantus
* SSI
* Daptomycin
* Flagyl
* Zosyn
* Hydralazine
* Clonidine
* PPI
* Tylenol
* Dilaudid

The patient's current lab results include:

* WBC: 0.2
* Hct: 30.9%
* Plt: 15
* Cr: 1.3

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 5.7 L off yesterday, total for LOS in the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] of 16.1 L
   negative.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Plt did not
   bump appropriately last night after 2 units (13-
13) but at 27 this
   morning.  Discussed possiblity of plt antibody with transfusion
   medicine
 given bump to 27, less concerning for it.  Advised that to
   get an accurate plt count it must be drawn 15-30 minutes after
   transfusion which we have not been doing.
   -transfusion medicine to discuss plt goal with heme/onc
 who needs to
   discuss with principle investigator of study to determine bottom limit
   of acceptable plt count
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>30 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. Her
   hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt unfortunately
   does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer acting
   antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.  Was started on labetalol gtt
   yesterday which controlled bp
s well, has not required it this morning
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in the low 100s, pt
   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a
   sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low threhold and obtain
   surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures were drawn three
   days ago.
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - surveillance cx
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no(diarrhea and abdominal pain),
   currently one C. diff has been sent yesterday.
   - was on PO vancomycin, now on Flagyl
   - f/u c.diff assay
   - continue contact precautions
    # Diastolic HTN starting [**1-24**] likely [**3-3**] to Tacro toxicity
   - will monitor BP closely during CRRT
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # ? Line infection:
   - Cont daptomycin and zosyn
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) 443**] [**Name (NI) 152**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3339**]
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Holding TPN per heme/onc, will discuss with them today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 5.7 L off yesterday, total for LOS in the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] of 16.1 L
   negative.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Plt did not
   bump appropriately last night after 2 units (13-
13) but at 27 this
   morning.  Discussed possiblity of plt antibody with transfusion
   medicine
 given bump to 27, less concerning for it.  Advised that to
   get an accurate plt count it must be drawn 15-30 minutes after
   transfusion which we have not been doing.
   -transfusion medicine to discuss plt goal with heme/onc
 who needs to
   discuss with principle investigator of study to determine bottom limit
   of acceptable plt count
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>30 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. Her
   hydralazine was increased from 10mg q6h to 15mg q6h. Pt unfortunately
   does not take POs as she would benefit from a longer acting
   antihypertensive. Other options to consider for antihypertensive
   regimens are Clonidine patch, ACEI IV.  Was started on labetalol gtt
   yesterday which controlled bp
s well, has not required it this morning
   -Discuss with renal regarding starting a long term ACEI IV, Clonidine
   patch for BP control.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage. Overnight pt was noted to be tachycardic in the low 100s, pt
   was also noted to be
shaking
 and uncomfortable. Pt
s tachycardia
   appeared to improve after administration of Tylenol. Pt is currently on
   immunosuppressive therapy concern remains whether tachycardia may be a
   sign of an infectious state, will maintain a low threhold and obtain
   surveillance cultures particularly as last cultures were drawn three
   days ago.
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - surveillance cx
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no(diarrhea and abdominal pain),
   currently one C. diff has been sent yesterday.
   - was on PO vancomycin, now on Flagyl
   - f/u c.diff assay
   - continue contact precautions
    # Diastolic HTN starting [**1-24**] likely [**3-3**] to Tacro toxicity
   - will monitor BP closely during CRRT
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # ? Line infection:
   - Cont daptomycin and zosyn
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) 443**] [**Name (NI) 152**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3339**]

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - per transfusion medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn,
   recommended that we shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets
   are transfused - anything after that will definitely be lower.  Could
   also check a panel reactive antibody (did not do).  Can also transfuse
   'O' platelets if concerned (did not do)
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   - hct goal remains around 30 - but we should base it on her fluid
   status as well
   - plt count at 5pm was 15, got one unit along with her 8pm dose of
   Defibrotide
   - hct at 5pm was 33
   - renal recs to continues CVVH
   - patient with only minimal agitation - managed well with pain
   medication and ativan
   - Lantus increased to 50 units qd, off insulin gtt, on humalog sliding

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 5.7 L off yesterday, total for LOS in the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] of 16.1 L
   negative.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - per renal will try to maintain volume equilirium with 80 mg IV lasix
   [**Hospital1 **] today and hold off on further CVVHD; if she is persistently
   positive while on lasix, may have to restart CVVHD.
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers/Hypothermia
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours, however
   slightly hypothermic. Pt started on vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was
   tender and mildly erythematous. There was suspicion of line
   contamination so IJ line removed by IR on [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed
   [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**], per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime
   changed to zosyn for better anaerobe coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - warming blanket prn for hypothermia
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3)
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) 443**] [**Name (NI) 152**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3339**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - per transfusion medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn,
   recommended that we shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets
   are transfused - anything after that will definitely be lower.  Could
   also check a panel reactive antibody (did not do).  Can also transfuse
   'O' platelets if concerned (did not do)
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   - hct goal remains around 30 - but we should base it on her fluid
   status as well
   - plt count at 5pm was 15, got one unit along with her 8pm dose of
   Defibrotide
   - hct at 5pm was 33
   - renal recs to continues CVVH
   - patient with only minimal agitation - managed well with pain
   medication and ativan
   - Lantus increased to 50 units qd, off insulin gtt, on humalog sliding
   scale with q2h fingersticks and q6h SSI dosing per endocrine
   - sugars have been <200 overnight

Summary:

The patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who underwent ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood transplantation. She was transferred to the ICU for initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia. The patient has been experiencing several complications, including:

* Renal failure requiring CRRT, with a current volume overload
* Thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 15 and a goal of 20-30
* Hypertension, currently being managed with labetalol
* Fevers and hypothermia, with a current temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* Hyperglycemia, with a current glucose level of 184 mg/dL
* Mucositis, with slowing improvement
* Intragluteal folds rash, likely not fungal
* Nausea and bone pain, managed with antiemetics and pain regimen

Potential medical complications:

* Further decline in renal function, requiring adjustments to CRRT and potential need for dialysis
* Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia, particularly with invasive procedures
* Hypertensive crisis, potentially requiring urgent interventions
* Infection, particularly with line-related infections or C. difficile colitis
* VOD, potentially requiring treatment with defibrotide
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to mucositis
* Skin breakdown or infection due to intragluteal folds rash
* Cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias or cardiomyopathy

Plan:

* Continue CRRT and monitor renal function
* Monitor platelet count and transfuse as necessary to maintain a goal of 20-30
* Continue hypertension management with labetalol and monitor for signs of hypertensive crisis
* Continue to monitor and manage fevers and hypothermia
* Continue to manage hyperglycemia with Lantus and SSI
* Continue to monitor and manage mucositis, intragluteal folds rash, and nausea
* Continue to monitor and manage bone pain
* Continue to monitor for signs of infection and bleeding complications
* Consider adjustments to CRRT and potential need for dialysis based on renal function
* Consider adjustments to platelet transfusion strategy based on platelet count and bleeding risk
* Consider adjustments to hypertension management based on blood pressure and signs of hypertensive crisis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU patient with a complex medical history, including acute renal failure, lymphoma, and hyperglycemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 130/54 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Renal function: Creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 28 mg/dL
* Hematological: White blood cell count (WBC) 0.2 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) 12 K/uL
* Biochemical: Glucose 184 mg/dL, lactate 1.9 mmol/L
* Coagulation: International normalized ratio (INR) 1.7, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 32.0 seconds
* Electrolytes: Sodium 135 mmol/L, potassium 4.2 mmol/L, calcium 8.9 mg/dL

The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and immunosuppressants, as well as pain management and insulin therapy for hyperglycemia.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Renal failure: Continue renal replacement therapy (RRT) and consider continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) if necessary.
* Pain control: Continue pain regimen.
* Hyperglycemia: Continue insulin therapy and consider converting to Lantus if possible.
* Lymphoma: Continue immune regimen and defibrotide protocol per hematology service.
* Hyperbilirubinemia: Continue to trend and appears to be resolving.
* Pancytopenia, neutropenic fever, and VRE infection: Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and follow ID recommendations.
* Hypertension: Continue to monitor.
* Diabetes: Well-controlled on Lantus and RISS.

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of renal failure, leading to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance.
* Increased risk of infection due to neutropenia and immunosuppression.
* Hyperglycemia-related complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer or bleeding from anticoagulation therapy.
* Respiratory failure due to VAP or other respiratory complications.
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure due to electrolyte imbalance or medication side effects.
* Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia or anticoagulation therapy.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of lymphoma and undergoing cord blood stem cell transplantation. He has developed acute renal failure, requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (RRT). He also has hyperglycemia, which is being managed with insulin. The patient has been experiencing pain, which is being controlled with a pain regimen. He has developed pancytopenia, neutropenic fever, and VRE infection, and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. He has hypertension, which is being monitored, and diabetes, which is well-controlled with Lantus and RISS.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may progress to AKI, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
2. Sepsis: The patient's neutropenic fever and VRE infection may lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, or other complications if not properly managed.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or hypertensive encephalopathy, if not properly managed.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's neutropenic fever and VRE infection may lead to pneumonia, which can cause respiratory failure and increased mortality.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may lead to bleeding complications, such as petechiae, ecchymosis, or hemorrhage, if not properly managed.
7. Veno-Occlusive Disease (VOD): The patient's history of cord blood stem cell transplantation and diagnosis of lymphoma may increase his risk of developing VOD, which can cause liver failure and increased mortality.

These potential medical complications highlight the importance of close monitoring and management of the patient's condition to prevent or mitigate these complications and improve his overall outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Was off
   CVVHD yesterday and had a trial of 80 mg IV bid.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - per renal will try to maintain volume equilirium with 80 mg IV lasix
   [**Hospital1 **] today and hold off on further CVVHD; if she is persistently
   positive while on lasix, may have to restart CVVHD.
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and [**Hospital1 **] as needed to keep hct>30 and [**Hospital1 **]>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, [**Hospital1 **] >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers/Hypothermia
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours, however
   slightly hypothermic. Pt started on vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was
   tender and mildly erythematous. There was suspicion of line
   contamination so IJ line removed by IR on [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed
   [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**], per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime
   changed to zosyn for better anaerobe coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - warming blanket prn for hypothermia
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3)
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Was off
   CVVHD yesterday and had a trial of 80 mg IV bid.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - per renal will try to maintain volume equilirium with 80 mg IV lasix
   [**Hospital1 **] today and hold off on further CVVHD; if she is persistently
   positive while on lasix, may have to restart CVVHD.
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and [**Hospital1 **] as needed to keep hct>30 and [**Hospital1 **]>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, [**Hospital1 **] >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers/Hypothermia
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours, however
   slightly hypothermic. Pt started on vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was
   tender and mildly erythematous. There was suspicion of line
   contamination so IJ line removed by IR on [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed
   [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**], per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime
   changed to zosyn for better anaerobe coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - warming blanket prn for hypothermia
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3)
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood transplantation. She was transferred to the ICU for initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Renal function: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) and is on CRRT. She is volume overloaded and has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses of Lasix/thiazides. The plan is to maintain volume equilibrium with 80 mg IV Lasix and hold off on further CVVHD if she is persistently positive while on Lasix.
* T-cell lymphoma: The patient is on day 19 post-cord stem cell transplant and is taking Cellcept and solumedrol. She is also taking neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily to stimulate platelet production.
* Presumed VOD: The patient has RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of flow in the portal system. She is being treated with defibrotide.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient has persistently low platelet counts likely due to chemotherapy. She is being transfused with platelets to maintain a platelet count of >20.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure goals are SBP 130-150. She is off labetalol and will be monitored for hypertension.
* Fevers/Hypothermia: The patient has been afebrile for the last 24 hours but is slightly hypothermic. She is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels have been generally <200, and insulin gtt has been turned off. Her Lantus dose has been increased to 50 units qam.
* C. difficile colitis: The patient has had no diarrhea but continues to have RUQ abdominal pain. She is being treated with flagyl and contact precautions.
* Mucositis: The patient's mucositis is slowing improving and is being managed with supportive care and pain regimen.
* Intragluteal folds rash: The patient has a rash on her intragluteal folds that is unlikely to be fungal. She is being treated with Tucks pads PRN.
* Nausea: The patient is being treated with antiemetics.
* Bone pain: The patient is being treated with dilaudid PRN.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Progression of ARF: The patient's renal function is already compromised, and further deterioration could lead to more severe complications.
2. VOD: The patient's presumed VOD could lead to further complications such as liver failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, or death.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's persistently low platelet counts could lead to bleeding complications.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension could lead to cardiovascular complications such as heart failure or stroke.
5. Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state makes her more susceptible to infections, which could lead to sepsis or death.
6. Mucositis: The patient's mucositis could lead to further complications such as bleeding, infection, or malnutrition.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia could lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Was off
   CVVHD yesterday and had a trial of 80 mg IV bid.  She responded well to
   the lasix and put out 2.6 L and was only 1.3 L positive yesterday.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - Continue lasix 80 mg IV bid and following I/Os
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +20 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and [**Hospital1 **] as needed to keep hct>30 and [**Hospital1 **]>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, [**Hospital1 **] >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30, however her plt can be
   transfused for <20 given the difficulty maitaining her at 30.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to treatment with
   defibrotide.  Her T.bili continues to improve, today is 2.7.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 48 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3).   Will also start po vanc once she can take po
s per ID recs.
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) 443**] [**Name (NI) 152**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3339**]
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now per heme/onc.
   Glycemic Control:  Lantus and SSI as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to treatment with
   defibrotide.  Her T.bili continues to improve, today is 2.7.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 48 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3).   Will also start po vanc once she can take po
s per ID recs.
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn
   # Contact: [**Name (NI) 443**] [**Name (NI) 152**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3339**]

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who underwent ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood transplantation. She was transferred to the ICU for initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Renal function: The patient is still volume overloaded and has a persistently low platelet count. She has been on CRRT and has had a trial of diuresis with high doses of Lasix/thiazides.
* T-cell lymphoma: The patient is at day +20 post-cord stem cell transplant and is being treated with Cellcept and solumedrol. Her platelet and hemoglobin counts are being monitored, and she is being transfused as needed to maintain a platelet count of >20 and a hemoglobin count of >30.
* Presumed VOD: The patient has RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of flow in the portal system. She is being treated with defibrotide, and her T.bili is improving.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient has persistently low platelet counts, likely due to chemotherapy. She is being transfused as needed to maintain a platelet count of >20.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is being monitored, and she is off labetalol.
* Fevers: The patient has been afebrile for the last 48 hours and has been started on vancomycin.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are being monitored, and she is being treated with insulin and SSI.
* C. difficile colitis: The patient has had no diarrhea and continues to have RUQ abdominal pain, likely due to VOD. She is being treated with flagyl and will start po vanc once she can take po medications.
* Mucositis: The patient's mucositis is slowing improving, and she is being treated with supportive care and pain regimen.
* Intragluteal folds rash: The patient has an intragluteal folds rash that is unlikely to be fungal. She is being treated with Tucks pads PRN.
* Nausea: The patient is being treated with antiemetics.
* Bone pain: The patient is being treated with dilaudid PRN.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Renal failure: The patient's renal function is still compromised, and she may require continued CRRT or dialysis.
* Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases her risk of bleeding, and she may require platelet transfusions.
* Infection: The patient's neutropenia and immunosuppressive therapy increase her risk of infection. She may require continued antimicrobial therapy and close monitoring for signs of infection.
* VOD: The patient's presumed VOD may worsen, leading to further liver dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen, leading to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.
* C. difficile colitis: The patient's C. difficile colitis may worsen, leading to further complications such as diarrhea and abdominal pain.
* Mucositis: The patient's mucositis may worsen, leading to further complications such as pain and difficulty eating.
* Intragluteal folds rash: The patient's intragluteal folds rash may worsen, leading to further complications such as pain and discomfort.

Based on the patient's current status and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her condition. The patient's platelet and hemoglobin counts should be closely monitored, and she should be transfused as needed to maintain a platelet count of >20 and a hemoglobin count of >30. Her blood pressure should be closely monitored, and she should be treated with anti-hypertensive medications as needed. Her hyperglycemia should be closely monitored, and she should be treated with insulin and SSI as needed. Her C. difficile colitis should be closely monitored, and she should be treated with flagyl and po vanc as needed. Her mucositis should be closely monitored, and she should be treated with supportive care and pain regimen as needed. Her intragluteal folds rash should be closely monitored, and she should be treated with Tucks pads PRN as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 85.2 kg male with a chief complaint of 24-hour events, including a transfusion of 1u [**Name (NI) 3436**] and trial of Furosemide 80mg IV BID. The patient has a history of allergies to Codeine, Nausea/Vomiting, Sulfa (Sulfonamides), and Hives. The patient received antibiotics, including Daptomycin, Caspofungin, Metronidazole, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), and is currently receiving Furosemide, Lorazepam, and Pantoprazole.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 139/73 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. The patient's laboratory results show acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's inability to move or assess certain areas of the body. The patient's neurological examination is also limited due to the patient's inability to respond to stimuli.

The patient's assessment and plan include management of hyperglycemia, acute renal failure, and pain control. The patient is also being monitored for potential complications, including DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal liver function tests and elevated lactate levels, which may indicate sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and the patient's oxygen saturation is 95% on room air, which may indicate respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and the patient's heart rate is tachycardic, which may indicate cardiac complications.
4. Infection: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal liver function tests and elevated lactate levels, which may indicate infection.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's laboratory results show acute renal failure, which may require dialysis.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's laboratory results show hyperglycemia, which may require insulin therapy.
7. Liver Failure: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal liver function tests, which may indicate liver failure.
8. Bloodstream Infection: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal blood cultures, which may indicate a bloodstream infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 5.7 L off yesterday, total for LOS in the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] of 16.1 L
   negative.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - per renal will try to maintain volume equilirium with 80 mg IV lasix
   [**Hospital1 **] today and hold off on further CVVHD; if she is persistently
   positive while on lasix, may have to restart CVVHD.
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and [**Hospital1 **] as needed to keep hct>30 and [**Hospital1 **]>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, [**Hospital1 **] >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers/Hypothermia
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours, however
   slightly hypothermic. Pt started on vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was
   tender and mildly erythematous. There was suspicion of line
   contamination so IJ line removed by IR on [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed
   [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**], per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime
   changed to zosyn for better anaerobe coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - warming blanket prn for hypothermia
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3)
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Had a
   total of 5.7 L off yesterday, total for LOS in the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] of 16.1 L
   negative.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - per renal will try to maintain volume equilirium with 80 mg IV lasix
   [**Hospital1 **] today and hold off on further CVVHD; if she is persistently
   positive while on lasix, may have to restart CVVHD.
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +19 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and [**Hospital1 **] as needed to keep hct>30 and [**Hospital1 **]>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, [**Hospital1 **] >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30.  Hct goal will be difficult to
   attain given her persistenly low RBC liklely [**3-3**] to chemo.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to start treatment
   with defibrotide.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers/Hypothermia
 Had been afebrile for the last 24 hours, however
   slightly hypothermic. Pt started on vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was
   tender and mildly erythematous. There was suspicion of line
   contamination so IJ line removed by IR on [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed
   [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**], per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime
   changed to zosyn for better anaerobe coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   - warming blanket prn for hypothermia
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3)
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU patient with a complex medical history, including renal failure, lymphoma, hyperbilirubinemia, pancytopenia, neutropenic fever, VRE infection, hypertension, and hyperglycemia. The patient has undergone various interventions, including transfusions, antibiotics, and medication management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 134/79 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with an oxygen saturation of 97% and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of renal failure, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 23 mmol/L. The patient's white blood cell count is low, with a count of 0.2 K/uL. The patient's platelet count is also low, with a count of 27.

The patient's medical complications include acute renal failure, lymphoma, hyperbilirubinemia, pancytopenia, neutropenic fever, and VRE infection. The patient is at risk for further complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.

The patient's plan of care includes continued management of their acute renal failure, lymphoma, and hyperbilirubinemia. The patient will continue to receive broad-spectrum antibiotics for their VRE infection and will be monitored for signs of sepsis. The patient will also be monitored for signs of respiratory failure and will be given oxygen therapy as needed. The patient's pain will be managed with a pain regimen, and their hyperglycemia will be managed with insulin therapy.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex ICU patient with multiple medical complications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they are at risk for further complications. The patient's plan of care includes continued management of their medical complications and close monitoring for signs of sepsis, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old male with a history of lymphoma, acute renal failure, and VOD. He has been receiving treatment with tacrolimus, Cellcept, GCSF, steroids, and defibrotide. He has also been experiencing neutropenic fever, VRE infection, and hypertension. His current vital signs are as follows: Tmax 36.3°C (97.4°F), Tcurrent 35.7°C (96.3°F), HR 93 bpm, BP 134/79 mmHg, RR 16 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 97%. His physical examination is notable for tender abdomen, soft bowel sounds, and right-sided abdominal pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infection due to his neutropenic state and VRE infection.
2. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding.
3. VOD: The patient has a history of VOD, which can lead to liver failure and death.
4. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, and uremia.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia due to steroid treatment, which can lead to ketoacidosis and coma.
6. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which can lead to cardiac complications and stroke.
7. Pain: The patient is experiencing abdominal pain, which can lead to poor wound healing, infection, and decreased mobility.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to anemia, hypovolemia, and shock.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which can lead to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death.
10. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of hypertension, which can lead to cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and stroke.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Administer antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed to prevent infection.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse if necessary to prevent bleeding.
4. Continue to administer defibrotide and tacrolimus as prescribed to manage VOD and hypertension.
5. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as necessary to prevent hyperglycemia.
6. Continue to manage the patient's pain with analgesics and adjust as necessary to prevent poor wound healing and decreased mobility.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and administer antacids as necessary to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and administer oxygen as necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
9. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and administer medications as necessary to prevent cardiovascular complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   35 y/o female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who presented for
   ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood
   transplantation of a double cord, was transferred to the ICU for
   initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.
   # ARF/Need for CRRT - Sediment c/w ATN - Most likely etiology a
   combination of Prograf and acyclovir toxicity. Renal following. Remains
   volume overloaded. Has had aggressive trial of diuresis with high doses
   of Lasix/thiazides. Transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for initiation of CRRT.  Was off
   CVVHD yesterday and had a trial of 80 mg IV bid.  She responded well to
   the lasix and put out 2.6 L and was only 1.3 L positive yesterday.
   - Renal currently following pt, appreciate recs
   - Continue lasix 80 mg IV bid and following I/Os
   - trend lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   # T cell lymphoma: Day +20 post cord stem cell transplant.
   - Cont Cellcept and solumedrol 40 mg IV BID, hold tacrolimus given
   concern for toxicity, monitor daily levels
   - Awaiting recovery of counts (usually takes until day 21), transfusing
   pRBCs and plts as needed to keep hct>30 and plts>30.
   - continue neupogen 480 mcg SQ daily
   - daily coags, keep INR < 1.5 and fibrinogen > 150, plts >30, hct >30
   whilst on protocol
   - CBC with ANC [**Hospital1 **]
   - type and cross Q week, CMV viral load qweek, EBV viral load qweek
   (will check every Monday)
   - currently plt and hct goals both 30, however her plt can be
   transfused for <20 given the difficulty maitaining her at 30.
   # Presumed VOD - Pt with RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of
   flow in the portal system. Decision made by oncology to treatment with
   defibrotide.  Her T.bili continues to improve, today is 2.7.
   - continue defibrotide Q6H, infuse over 2 hours
   - plt and hct goals as above
   - tranfuse to current goals of plt>20 and hct >30 per heme/onc
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Persisently low likely [**3-3**] chemo.  Per transfusion
   medicine, low likelihood of anti-plt ab rxn, recommended that we
   shouldget a plt count 15-20 min after the platelets are transfused -
   anything after that will definitely be lower.
   - per heme/onc who spoke with the PI of the protocol, absolute lowest
   plt count is 20.  We should check it [**Hospital1 **] (3am and 3pm) and transfuse
   for significantly lower than 20
   # Hypertension: Current blood pressure goals for pt is SBP 130-150. She
   is off the labetalol gtt.
   - Continue to monitor and consider labetalol or hydralazine if she
   becomes hypertensive.
   # Fevers
 Had been afebrile for the last 48 hours. Pt started on
   vancomycin [**2149-1-18**] as L IJ CVL was tender and mildly erythematous.
   There was suspicion of line contamination so IJ line removed by IR on
   [**2149-1-20**]. Hickman removed [**1-30**]( due to VRE on BC), PICC in place [**1-31**],
   per ID c/s on [**2-1**] cefepime changed to zosyn for better anaerobe
   coverage
   - continue dapto, flagyl and zosyn, and casopfungin as outlined below
   - f/u cultures
   - f/u ID recs
   # Hyperglycemia
 FS generally < 200s, insulin gtt turned off.
   Hyperglycemia likely [**3-3**] to Solumedrol. Lantus increased to 50 units of
   lantus qam.
   - Continue increased lantus dose with SSI coverage.  Uptitrate as
   necessary.
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following, appreciate recs
   # h/o C. difficile colitis: Has had no diarrhea, continues to have RUQ
   abd pain (likely from VOD).  C.diff neg x 3.
   -Continue flagyl per ID recs as patient is neutopenic (even with C.diff
   neg x 3).   Will also start po vanc once she can take po
s per ID recs.
   - continue contact precautions
    # Mucositis, slowing improving
   - continue supportive care and pain regimen
   # Intragluteal folds rash: Unlikely to be fungal (no satellite lesions,
   just appears irritated). Continue Tucks pads PRN.
   # Nausea: Cont antiemetics.
   # Bone pain: Cont dilaudid prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient called out, however the BMT team was concerned about her
   mental status when they visited her.  She was awake and alert when
   evaluated after they left as she had been in the am.  The plan is to
   call her out in the am.
   - Her lantus was increased to 65 units [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**].
   - Per renal, continue diuresing with lasix and hold of CVVHD for now.
   Continue to hold IV acyclovir and ? of restarting tacroliums.
   - Per ID, continue antibiotics as they are, except change flagyl to po
   vanc when she is able to take po's.  Heme/onc wants a S&S consult
   before allowing her to take po's.
   - She got 1 unit of pRBC, 1 unit of FFP, and a few units of Plt over
   the last 24 h.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 35-year-old female with a history of T-cell lymphoma who underwent ablative chemotherapy with TBI Cytoxan followed by cord blood transplantation. She was transferred to the ICU for initiation of CRRT and management of hyperglycemia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: SpO2 90%, ABG //23/
* Cardiovascular: BP 148/85 mmHg, HR 80 bpm
* Neurologic: Alert and oriented x 3, answers questions appropriately and follows commands
* Renal: CRRT initiated, currently following pt, appreciate recs
* Gastrointestinal: RUQ pain, ascites, and question of reversal of flow in the portal system, presumed VOD, treated with defibrotide
* Hematologic: Thrombocytopenia, persistent low platelet count, likely due to [**3-3**] chemo
* Infections: C. difficile colitis, currently on flagyl and casopfungin, awaiting recovery of counts
* Endocrine: Hyperglycemia, likely due to Solumedrol, Lantus increased to 65 units qam

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Renal failure: The patient is currently on CRRT, and there is a risk of further deterioration of renal function.
2. VOD: The patient has presumed VOD, which can lead to liver failure and increased risk of bleeding.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's persistent low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.
4. Infections: The patient is at risk of developing further infections, particularly due to neutropenia.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen, leading to complications such as ketoacidosis.
6. Mucositis: The patient's mucositis may progress, leading to further pain and discomfort.
7. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may worsen, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
8. Bone pain: The patient's bone pain may worsen, leading to further discomfort and decreased mobility.

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue CRRT and monitor renal function closely.
2. Continue defibrotide and monitor liver function tests.
3. Continue platelet transfusions and monitor platelet count.
4. Continue antibiotics and monitor for signs of infection.
5. Continue insulin and Lantus to manage hyperglycemia.
6. Continue supportive care and pain regimen for mucositis.
7. Continue antiemetics for nausea and vomiting.
8. Continue dilaudid prn for bone pain.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications. Further assessment and plan adjustments will be necessary based on the patient's response to treatment."
