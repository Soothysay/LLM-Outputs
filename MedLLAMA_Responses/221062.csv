   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: No signs of sepsis on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 5**] as pt was normotensive.  Likely acquired from urine source as pt
   has positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although
   pt has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Lactate is normal. Overnight, patient became febrile and hypotensive
   consistent with recurrent sepsis. WBC increased from 17 to 44
   overnight. Diff shows 97% PMNs but no bands. Normal lactate reassuring.
   - ID consult
   - Continue Ceftaz per ID recommendations
   - Continue Gent until cultures clear
   - Consider abdominal imaging per ID recs
   - Consider repeat spinal imaging
   - US pacer/AICD pocket
   - Monitor for signs of endocarditis; TEE later this week for higher
   quality imaging
   - Trend repeat blood cultures
   - Remove HD line today by IR
 culture tip
   - Remove other lines and plan for line holiday until cx clear
 culture
   tip
   - Trend stool x 3 for C. diff (1^st sample pending)
   - Add-on LFTs
   - F/U CRP
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   - f/u vanc levels
   .
   3. History of Hypotension: differential includes sepsis given
   bactermia, and pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday.
   However, given that this only occurred with dialysis, it may be due to
   hypovolemia.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or
   ECG changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in
   the anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   concerning for contined sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Wean pressors when tolerated
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday for
   bacteremia.
   - renal dialysis team consult
   - f/u cultures
   - removal of HD line by IR today
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - pain consult today for ? injection
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   8. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: No signs of sepsis on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 5**] as pt was normotensive.  Likely acquired from urine source as pt
   has positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although
   pt has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Lactate is normal. Overnight, patient became febrile and hypotensive
   consistent with recurrent sepsis. WBC increased from 17 to 44
   overnight. Diff shows 97% PMNs but no bands. Normal lactate reassuring.
   - ID consult
   - Continue Ceftaz per ID recommendations
   - Continue Gent until cultures clear
   - Consider abdominal imaging per ID recs
   - Consider repeat spinal imaging
   - US pacer/AICD pocket
   - Monitor for signs of endocarditis; TEE later this week for higher
   quality imaging
   - Trend repeat blood cultures
   - Remove HD line today by IR
 culture tip
   - Remove other lines and plan for line holiday until cx clear
 culture
   tip
   - Trend stool x 3 for C. diff (1^st sample pending)
   - Add-on LFTs
   - F/U CRP
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   - f/u vanc levels
   .
   3. History of Hypotension: differential includes sepsis given
   bactermia, and pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday.
   However, given that this only occurred with dialysis, it may be due to
   hypovolemia.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or
   ECG changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in
   the anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   concerning for contined sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Wean pressors when tolerated
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday for
   bacteremia.
   - renal dialysis team consult
   - f/u cultures
   - removal of HD line by IR today
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - pain consult today for ? injection
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   8. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). He was transferred from another hospital with Pseudomonas and Gram-Positive Cocci (GPC) bacteremia associated with hypotension. He has been on Ceftazidime for 2 days and is currently febrile and hypotensive. The patient's white blood cell count has increased from 17 to 44 overnight, and the differential shows 97% polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) but no bands. The patient's lactate level is normal.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis/Pseudomonas Bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia is likely due to a line infection, and the ID consult recommends removing the HD line and culturing the tip. The patient's WBC count has increased, and the differential shows 97% PMNs, which is concerning for sepsis.
2. GPC Bacteremia: The patient's GPC bacteremia is likely a contaminant, but it is still a concern. The patient is currently on vancomycin, and the ID consult recommends redrawing blood cultures and following up on vanc levels.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is concerning, especially since it occurred post-HD. The patient may have hypovolemia, but given his bacteremia and fever, sepsis is also a concern.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient will need a new line placed after the line holiday for bacteremia.
5. PVD: The patient's PVD is being managed with Pentoxifylline.
6. Back Pain: The patient's back pain is chronic, but it has worsened in the past week. A CT scan did not show an epidural abscess, and the patient is being managed with Ultram, oxycodone, and lidocaine patch.
7. CAD: The patient's CAD is being managed with aspirin and statin, and the beta blocker is being held due to hypotension.
8. DM: The patient is currently hypoglycemic during HD and is not on any oral hyperglycemic agents.

Recommendations:

1. Remove the HD line today by IR and culture the tip.
2. Continue Ceftazidime per ID recommendations.
3. Continue Gentamicin until cultures clear.
4. Consider abdominal imaging per ID recs.
5. Consider repeat spinal imaging.
6. Monitor for signs of endocarditis; TEE later this week for higher-quality imaging.
7. Trend repeat blood cultures.
8. Remove other lines and plan for line holiday until cultures clear.
9. Trend stool x 3 for C. diff (1st sample pending).
10. Add-on LFTs.
11. F/U CRP.
12. Continue vancomycin dosed per HD.
13. Redraw blood cultures.
14. F/u cultures from OSH.
15. F/u vanc levels.
16. Wean pressors when tolerated.
17. Continue to monitor BPs.
18. Consult nephrology for line placement after line holiday.
19. Continue Pentoxifylline for PVD.
20. Manage back pain with Ultram, oxycodone, and lidocaine patch.
21. Hold beta blocker in the setting of hypotension.
22. Manage DM with Humalog SS."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis.
   Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive UTI.
   Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur on
   exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Lactate is
   normal WBC increased from 17 to 44 overnight. Diff shows 97% PMNs but
   no bands. Normal lactate reassuring.
   - ID consult
   - Continue Ceftaz, vanco per ID recommendations
   - Continue Gent until cultures clear
   - Antibiotic dosing: vanco with dialysis; ceftaz usually dosed with
   dialysis but patient will be on HD holiday; will discuss dosing plan
   with ID and pharmacy (may change to [**Last Name (un) **]; would need to determine [**Last Name (un) **]
   sensitivities from micro)
   - Consider abdominal imaging per ID recs to rule out other collections
   - Consider repeat L spine imaging to rule out abscess given back pain,
   bacteremia
   - US pacer/AICD pocket
   - Monitor for signs of endocarditis; TEE later this week for higher
   quality imaging
   - Trend repeat blood cultures
   - Removed HD line [**4-23**] by IR
 tip culture pending
   - Plan to maintain femoral line for pressors/abx for now; remove EJ
   line; plan for line holiday until cx clear for 24 hours (culture tips)
   - Attempt to place peripheral line earlier rather than later as patient
   will become more edematous with time
   - Trend stool x 3 for C. diff (1^st sample pending)
   - Add-on LFTs
   - F/U CRP
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   - f/u vanc levels
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   now on levophed. Differential includes sepsis given bactermia vs
   hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac event seems unlikely
   given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although echo did show new wall
   motion abnormalities in the anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient
   developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on
   Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be secondary to hypovolemia,
   but given patient also febrile and episode several hours post-dialysis
   concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Wean pressors when tolerated
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.
   - renal dialysis team consult
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - pain consult today for ? injection
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   8. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis.
   Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive UTI.
   Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur on
   exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Lactate is
   normal WBC increased from 17 to 44 overnight. Diff shows 97% PMNs but
   no bands. Normal lactate reassuring.
   - ID consult
   - Continue Ceftaz, vanco per ID recommendations
   - Continue Gent until cultures clear
   - Antibiotic dosing: vanco with dialysis; ceftaz usually dosed with
   dialysis but patient will be on HD holiday; will discuss dosing plan
   with ID and pharmacy (may change to [**Last Name (un) **]; would need to determine [**Last Name (un) **]
   sensitivities from micro)
   - Consider abdominal imaging per ID recs to rule out other collections
   - Consider repeat L spine imaging to rule out abscess given back pain,
   bacteremia
   - US pacer/AICD pocket
   - Monitor for signs of endocarditis; TEE later this week for higher
   quality imaging
   - Trend repeat blood cultures
   - Removed HD line [**4-23**] by IR
 tip culture pending
   - Plan to maintain femoral line for pressors/abx for now; remove EJ
   line; plan for line holiday until cx clear for 24 hours (culture tips)
   - Attempt to place peripheral line earlier rather than later as patient
   will become more edematous with time
   - Trend stool x 3 for C. diff (1^st sample pending)
   - Add-on LFTs
   - F/U CRP
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   - f/u vanc levels
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   now on levophed. Differential includes sepsis given bactermia vs
   hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac event seems unlikely
   given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although echo did show new wall
   motion abnormalities in the anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient
   developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on
   Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be secondary to hypovolemia,
   but given patient also febrile and episode several hours post-dialysis
   concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Wean pressors when tolerated
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.
   - renal dialysis team consult
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - pain consult today for ? injection
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   8. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, renal/cardiac diabetic diet as
   tolerated; 1500 cc fluid restriction daily
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots
   # Access: peripheral in right EJ, femoral CVL

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). He was transferred from another hospital with Pseudomonas and Gram-Positive Cocci (GPC) bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Sepsis/Pseudomonas bacteremia: The patient is febrile and hypotensive, and the bacteremia is likely acquired from the urine source.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and he requires pressors to maintain blood pressure.
* ESRD on HD: The patient requires a new line to be placed after the current line holiday (48 hours culture negative).
* PVD: The patient continues to take Pentoxifylline.
* Back Pain: The patient has chronic back pain, which is more severe in the past week, and has undergone a CT scan at OSH, which did not show an epidural abscess.
* CAD: The patient continues to take aspirin and a statin, and his beta blocker is being held in the setting of hypotension.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued sepsis and bacteremia, which may lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
* Hypotension, which may lead to cardiovascular instability and organ dysfunction.
* ESRD on HD, which may lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
* PVD, which may lead to limb ischemia and gangrene.
* Back pain, which may lead to chronic pain and disability.
* CAD, which may lead to myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue Ceftaz, vancomycin, and Gentamicin as per ID recommendations.
* Monitor for signs of endocarditis and trend repeat blood cultures.
* Remove HD line and place a new line after 48 hours of culture-negative results.
* Continue Pentoxifylline for PVD.
* Continue aspirin and statin for CAD.
* Manage back pain with oxycodone, standing tylenol, and lidocaine patch.
* Monitor blood glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
* Continue to monitor for signs of sepsis and bacteremia.

The patient's disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: No signs of sepsis on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 5**] as pt was normotensive.  Likely acquired from urine source as pt
   has positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although
   pt has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Lactate is normal. Overnight, patient became febrile and hypotensive
   consistent with recurrent sepsis. WBC increased from 17 to 44
   overnight. Diff shows 97% PMNs but no bands. Normal lactate reassuring.
   - ID consult
   - Continue Ceftaz per ID recommendations
   - Continue Gent until cultures clear
   - Consider abdominal imaging per ID recs
   - Consider repeat spinal imaging
   - US pacer/AICD pocket
   - Monitor for signs of endocarditis; TEE later this week for higher
   quality imaging
   - Trend repeat blood cultures
   - Remove HD line today by IR
 culture tip
   - Remove other lines and plan for line holiday until cx clear
 culture
   tip
   - Trend stool x 3 for C. diff (1^st sample pending)
   - Add-on LFTs
   - F/U CRP
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   - f/u vanc levels
   .
   3. History of Hypotension: differential includes sepsis given
   bactermia, and pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday.
   However, given that this only occurred with dialysis, it may be due to
   hypovolemia.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or
   ECG changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in
   the anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   concerning for contined sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Wean pressors when tolerated
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday for
   bacteremia.
   - renal dialysis team consult
   - f/u cultures
   - removal of HD line by IR today
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - pain consult today for ? injection
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   8. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (HD), chronic heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. He was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with pseudomonas and GPC bacteremia associated with hypotension. The patient has a history of hypotension, and his blood cultures showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa. He is currently febrile and hypotensive, and his white blood cell count increased from 17 to 44 overnight.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Sepsis/Pseudomonas bacteremia: The patient likely acquired the infection from the urine source, and the line is infected. The patient is being treated with ceftaz, and ID consult is recommended.
2. GPCs in blood: The patient has gram-positive bacteria in his blood, which may be contaminant or a separate infection. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, and blood cultures are being redrawn.
3. History of Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac event. The patient is being treated with pressors, and his blood pressure is being monitored.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient needs a new line placed after the line holiday for bacteremia.
5. PVD: The patient is being treated with pentoxifylline for his peripheral vascular disease.
6. Back Pain: The patient's back pain appears chronic, and a CT scan did not show an epidural abscess. The patient is being treated with pain medication and is being referred to a pain consult for possible injection.
7. CAD: The patient is being treated with aspirin and statin for his coronary artery disease.
8. DM: The patient is being treated with humalog SS for his diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his bacteremia and hypotension.
2. Endocarditis: The patient is at risk for endocarditis due to his bacteremia and history of murmur.
3. Line infection: The patient's line is infected, and removal of the line is recommended.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac event.
5. Cardiac event: The patient's cardiac history and new wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram make him at risk for cardiac event.
6. GPC bacteremia: The patient has gram-positive bacteria in his blood, which may be contaminant or a separate infection.
7. C. diff: The patient is at risk for C. diff infection due to his history of pseudomonas and GPC bacteremia.
8. Abdominal infection: The patient is at risk for abdominal infection due to his bacteremia and history of abdominal pain.

Recommendations:

1. Continue ID consult and treatment for sepsis and bacteremia.
2. Remove the infected line and replace it with a new one.
3. Continue vancomycin for GPC bacteremia.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Consider repeat echocardiogram to rule out endocarditis.
6. Monitor the patient's stool for C. diff infection.
7. Consider abdominal imaging to assess for fluid collection.
8. Continue pain management and refer to pain consult for possible injection."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: No signs of sepsis on presentation to
   [**Hospital1 5**] as pt was normotensive.  Likely acquired from urine source as pt
   has positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although
   pt has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Lactate is normal. Overnight, patient became febrile and hypotensive
   consistent with recurrent sepsis. WBC increased from 17 to 44
   overnight. Diff shows 97% PMNs but no bands. Normal lactate reassuring.
   - ID consult
   - continue Ceftaz per ID recommendations; patient received 1 dose gent
   on [**4-22**]
   - consider double-coverage with Cipro; although per ID, this is not
   necessary
   - Consider abdominal imaging per ID recs
   - monitor for signs of endocarditis and consider TEE for higher quality
   imaging
   - Trend repeat blood cultures
   - remove HD line today (and likely replace) by IR
 culture tip
   - remove other lines and plan for line holiday until cx clear
 culture
   tip
   - Trend stool x 3 for C. diff
   - Add-on LFTs
   - F/U CRP
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   - f/u vanc levels
   .
   3. History of Hypotension: differential includes sepsis given
   bactermia, and pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday.
   However, given that this only occurred with dialysis, it may be due to
   hypovolemia.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or
   ECG changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in
   the anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   concerning for contined sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Wean pressors when tolerated
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday for
   bacteremia.
   - renal dialysis team consult
   - f/u cultures
   - removal of HD line by IR today
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - pain consult today for ? injection
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   8. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU with Pseudomonas and Gram-Positive Cocci (GPC) bacteremia associated with hypotension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Temperature: 101.3°F (38.5°C)
* Blood pressure: 99/48 mmHg (normal range: 90-140/60-90 mmHg)
* Heart rate: 65 beats per minute (normal range: 60-100 beats per minute)
* Respiratory rate: 11 breaths per minute (normal range: 12-20 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 96% (normal range: 95-100%)
* White blood cell count: 44.1 K/μL (normal range: 4.5-11.0 K/μL)
* Platelet count: 190 K/μL (normal range: 150-450 K/μL)
* Hematocrit: 28.3% (normal range: 37-52%)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 27 mg/dL (normal range: 7-20 mg/dL)
* Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)

1. Sepsis/Pseudomonas bacteremia: The patient has a history of Pseudomonas bacteremia, which is likely acquired from the urinary tract. The patient is febrile and hypotensive, consistent with recurrent sepsis.
2. GPC bacteremia: The patient has a history of GPC bacteremia, which is likely contaminant given the presence of GPC in multiple blood cultures.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac event.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient requires regular hemodialysis, which may be complicated by bacteremia.
5. PVD: The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease, which may be complicated by bacteremia.
6. Back pain: The patient has chronic back pain, which may be exacerbated by bacteremia.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Blood cultures: Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from the blood cultures.
* Urine culture: Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from the urine culture.
* WBC count: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating infection.
* Platelet count: The patient's platelet count is normal.
* Hematocrit: The patient's hematocrit is slightly low, indicating anemia.
* Blood urea nitrogen: The patient's blood urea nitrogen is elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction.
* Creatinine: The patient's creatinine is elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction.
* Lactic acid: The patient's lactic acid level is slightly elevated, indicating metabolic acidosis.
* Calcium: The patient's calcium level is slightly low, indicating hypocalcemia.
* Magnesium: The patient's magnesium level is slightly low, indicating hypomagnesemia.
* Phosphate: The patient's phosphate level is slightly high, indicating hyperphosphatemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension.
   .
   1. Pseudomonas Bacteremia: No signs of sepsis currently as pt is
   normotensive.  Likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive
   UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur
   on exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Lactate is
   normal.
   - ID consult
   - continue Ceftaz per ID recommendations
   - consider double-coverage with Cipro; although per ID, this is not
   necessary
   - monitor for signs of endocarditis and consider TEE for higher quality
   imaging
   - Trend repeat blood cultures
   - remove HD line today (and likely replace) by IR
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   - f/u vanc levels
   .
   3. History of Hypotension: differential includes sepsis given
   bactermia, and pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday.
   However, given that this only occurred with dialysis, it may be due to
   hypovolemia.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or
   ECG changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in
   the anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   concerning for contined sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Wean pressors when tolerated
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday for
   bacteremia.
   - renal dialysis team consult
   - f/u cultures
   - removal of HD line by IR today
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - pain consult today for ? injection
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   8. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension.
   .
   1. Pseudomonas Bacteremia: No signs of sepsis currently as pt is
   normotensive.  Likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive
   UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur
   on exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Lactate is
   normal.
   - ID consult
   - continue Ceftaz per ID recommendations
   - consider double-coverage with Cipro; although per ID, this is not
   necessary
   - monitor for signs of endocarditis and consider TEE for higher quality
   imaging
   - Trend repeat blood cultures
   - remove HD line today (and likely replace) by IR
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   - f/u vanc levels
   .
   3. History of Hypotension: differential includes sepsis given
   bactermia, and pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday.
   However, given that this only occurred with dialysis, it may be due to
   hypovolemia.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or
   ECG changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in
   the anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   concerning for contined sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Wean pressors when tolerated
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday for
   bacteremia.
   - renal dialysis team consult
   - f/u cultures
   - removal of HD line by IR today
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - pain consult today for ? injection
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   8. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   .

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). He was transferred from another hospital with Pseudomonas and Gram-Positive Cocci (GPC) bacteremia associated with hypotension. The patient is currently receiving HD, antibiotics, and pressors. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a fever of 101.3°F (38.5°C) and a lactate level of 1.2 mmol/L.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pseudomonas Bacteremia:
	* Risk of sepsis and endocarditis
	* Need for ID consult, continuation of Ceftaz, and monitoring for signs of endocarditis
2. GPCs in Blood:
	* Risk of Gram-Positive Bacteremia
	* Need for continuation of vancomycin, redrawn blood cultures, and follow-up cultures
3. History of Hypotension:
	* Risk of continued sepsis and hypovolemia
	* Need for close monitoring of blood pressure and weaning of pressors when tolerated
4. ESRD on HD:
	* Need for new line placement after line holiday for bacteremia
	* Risk of continued bacteremia and sepsis
5. PVD:
	* Risk of continued pain and discomfort
	* Need for continuation of Pentoxifylline
6. Back Pain:
	* Risk of continued pain and discomfort
	* Need for continued monitoring and pain control measures
7. CAD:
	* Risk of continued cardiac complications
	* Need for continuation of aspirin and statin therapy
8. DM:
	* Risk of hypoglycemia during HD
	* Need for continuation of Humalog and close monitoring of blood glucose levels

Recommendations:

1. ID consult for Pseudomonas Bacteremia
2. Continue Ceftaz and monitor for signs of endocarditis
3. Consider double-coverage with Cipro
4. Monitor for signs of Gram-Positive Bacteremia
5. Continue vancomycin and redrawn blood cultures
6. Wean pressors when tolerated
7. New line placement after line holiday for bacteremia
8. Continue Pentoxifylline for PVD
9. Monitor and manage back pain
10. Continue aspirin and statin therapy for CAD
11. Monitor and manage DM
12. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis.
   Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive UTI.
   Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur on
   exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Culture
   positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (likely pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD and EJ lines have been removed; femoral line remains in place.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - check gent level
   - Change ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - place PICC line then D/C femoral line
   -  TTE or TEE to evaluate for endocarditis
   - F/U pacer/AICD pocket  ultrasound
   - consider repeat L spine imaging
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - Consider pain consult if sx worsen
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, renal/cardiac diabetic diet as
   tolerated; 1500 cc fluid restriction daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis.
   Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive UTI.
   Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur on
   exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Culture
   positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (likely pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD and EJ lines have been removed; femoral line remains in place.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - check gent level
   - Change ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - place PICC line then D/C femoral line
   -  TTE or TEE to evaluate for endocarditis
   - F/U pacer/AICD pocket  ultrasound
   - consider repeat L spine imaging
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - Consider pain consult if sx worsen
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, renal/cardiac diabetic diet as
   tolerated; 1500 cc fluid restriction daily
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). He was admitted with Pseudomonas and GPC bacteremia, and has since developed C. difficile infection. He has been on antibiotics, including Gentamicin, Ceftazidime, and Metronidazole, and has undergone removal of several lines, including the HD line, EJ line, and femoral line.

The patient has been experiencing hypotension, fever, and discomfort, and has required pressors to maintain blood pressure. He has also developed new wall motion abnormalities on echocardiogram. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypovolemia, and cardiac event.

The patient has several medical conditions that require ongoing management, including ESRD on HD, PVD, DM, and CAD. He is also experiencing back pain, which may be related to a chronic condition or a recent exacerbation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis/Pseudomonas bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia is likely acquired from the urine source, and the lines are infected. He is at risk for continued sepsis and bacteremia.
2. Endocarditis: Although the patient has a murmur, it is unclear whether it is related to endocarditis. He requires further evaluation, including a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).
3. GPC bacteremia: The patient has GPC bacteremia, which may be contaminant or represent a separate infection.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely related to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac event. He requires ongoing monitoring and management.
5. ESRD on HD: The patient requires ongoing dialysis management, including placement of a new line after a 48-hour culture-negative line holiday.
6. C. difficile infection: The patient has C. difficile infection, which requires ongoing treatment and management.
7. Back pain: The patient's back pain is likely related to a chronic condition, but may require further evaluation and management.
8. CAD: The patient's CAD requires ongoing management, including aspirin and statin therapy.
9. DM: The patient's DM requires ongoing management, including glycemic control and dietary therapy.
10. Drop in Hct: The patient's drop in Hct is likely related to dilutional anemia, but may require further evaluation and management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for sepsis and bacteremia.
2. Place a PICC line and remove the femoral line.
3. Perform a TEE to evaluate for endocarditis.
4. Monitor blood pressure and manage hypotension.
5. Manage ESRD on HD, including placement of a new line.
6. Continue treatment for C. difficile infection.
7. Manage back pain with pain control and further evaluation.
8. Manage CAD with aspirin and statin therapy.
9. Manage DM with glycemic control and dietary therapy.
10. Monitor Hct and manage anemia as necessary."

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a tunneled line stop, and subsequent blood cultures were sent. The patient has a history of GNR infection, and a recent blood culture from 4/22 was positive for GNR. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate of 65 bpm, and blood pressure of 88/53 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 95%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of GNR infection and the presence of GNR in the blood culture, there is a high risk of sepsis.
2. Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures are pending, but the presence of GNR in the blood culture suggests bacteremia.
3. Catheter-related infections: The patient has a tunneled line stop and multiple lines in place, which increases the risk of catheter-related infections.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via nasal cannula, which increases the risk of VAP.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, which may indicate stress ulcer.
6. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and the presence of multiple lines.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, which may indicate gastrointestinal complications such as Clostridioides difficile infection.
8. Renal failure: The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, which may indicate renal failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Administer antibiotics as directed by the patient's treating physician.
3. Consider adding a second antibiotic to cover potential resistant organisms.
4. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and adjust as necessary.
5. Consider adding a stress ulcer prophylaxis medication.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust oxygen delivery as necessary.
7. Consider adding a DVT prophylaxis medication.
8. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust as necessary.
9. Consider adding a medication to prevent Clostridioides difficile infection.
10. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis.
   Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive UTI.
   Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur on
   exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Culture
   positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (likely pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD and EJ lines have been removed; femoral line remains in place.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Ceftaz, Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent
   should continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Confirm Ceftaz with ID team given HD dosing and difficulty of
   checking levels; will check [**Last Name (un) **] sensitivities when newest culture is
   speciated
   - Consider abdominal imaging per ID recs to rule out other collections
   - Consider repeat L spine imaging to rule out abscess given back pain,
   bacteremia
   - F/U US of pacer/AICD pocket (done yesterday, no read)
   - Monitor for signs of endocarditis; TEE later this week for higher
   quality imaging
   - Consider TTE today per ID recs
   - Trend surveillence blood cultures, catheter tip cultures
   - Removed HD line [**4-23**] by IR
 tip culture pending
   - Plan to maintain femoral line for pressors/abx for now; remove EJ
   line; plan for line holiday until cx clear for 24 hours (culture tips)
   - Attempt to place peripheral line earlier rather than later as patient
   will become more edematous with time
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - Consider pain consult if sx worsen
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   8. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   9. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with sepsis and bacteremia associated with Pseudomonas and Gram-Positive Cocci (GPC).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 37°C (98.6°F), Heart Rate 65 beats per minute, Blood Pressure 88/53 mmHg, Respiratory Rate 10 breaths per minute, and Oxygen Saturation 95%.
* Laboratory results: White Blood Cell Count 17.3 x 10^9/L, Hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL, Platelet Count 125 x 10^9/L, Creatinine 5.2 mg/dL, and Lactic Acid 1.2 mmol/L.
* Imaging studies: Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows no evidence of abscess or collection.
* Physical examination: The patient is awake and alert but uncomfortable with movement, with a murmur on examination. He has multiple lesions on his feet that appear to be healing.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis and bacteremia: The patient has a history of sepsis and bacteremia, and the current cultures are positive for GNR. It is essential to continue antibiotic therapy and monitor for signs of endocarditis.
* Endocarditis: The patient has a murmur on examination, and there is a low concern for endocarditis. However, it is essential to monitor for signs of endocarditis and consider further imaging studies.
* Hypotension: The patient has required dopamine and levophed to maintain blood pressure, and the differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypovolemia, and cardiac event.
* ESRD on HD: The patient requires a new line placement after the line holiday (48 hours culture-negative) for bacteremia.
* PVD: The patient has a history of PVD, and it is essential to continue Pentoxifylline therapy.
* Back pain: The patient has chronic back pain, and it is essential to continue monitoring and managing pain with oxycodone and lidocaine patch.
* CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, and it is essential to continue aspirin and statin therapy.
* DM: The patient has a history of DM, and it is essential to continue monitoring blood glucose levels and adjust therapy as needed.
* Drop in Hct: The patient's Hematocrit has decreased, and it is essential to monitor and manage anemia with transfusions if necessary.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue antibiotic therapy for sepsis and bacteremia
* Monitor for signs of endocarditis
* Continue to manage hypotension with dopamine and levophed
* Place a new line after the line holiday for bacteremia
* Continue Pentoxifylline therapy for PVD
* Manage back pain with oxycodone and lidocaine patch
* Continue aspirin and statin therapy for CAD
* Monitor blood glucose levels and adjust therapy as needed for DM
* Monitor and manage anemia with transfusions if necessary
* Continue renal dialysis therapy as scheduled
* Monitor for signs of infection and adjust therapy as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis.
   Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive UTI.
   Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur on
   exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Culture
   positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (likely pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD and EJ lines have been removed; femoral line remains in place.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Ceftaz, Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent
   should continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Confirm Ceftaz with ID team given HD dosing and difficulty of
   checking levels; will check [**Last Name (un) **] sensitivities when newest culture is
   speciated
   - Consider abdominal imaging per ID recs to rule out other collections
   - Consider repeat L spine imaging to rule out abscess given back pain,
   bacteremia
   - F/U US of pacer/AICD pocket (done yesterday, no read)
   - Monitor for signs of endocarditis; TEE later this week for higher
   quality imaging
   - Consider TTE today per ID recs
   - Trend surveillence blood cultures, catheter tip cultures
   - Removed HD line [**4-23**] by IR
 tip culture pending
   - Plan to maintain femoral line for pressors/abx for now; remove EJ
   line; plan for line holiday until cx clear for 24 hours (culture tips)
   - Attempt to place peripheral line earlier rather than later as patient
   will become more edematous with time
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - Consider pain consult if sx worsen
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   8. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   9. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 70-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on Hemodialysis (HD), Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), was admitted to the ICU with pseudomonas and Gram-Positive Cocci (GPC) bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature (T) 37°C (98.6°F), Heart Rate (HR) 65 beats per minute (bpm), Blood Pressure (BP) 88/53 mmHg, Respiratory Rate (RR) 10 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 95%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is normotensive, but has required pressors in the past.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received 1,755 mL of fluid over the past 24 hours, with a total output of 700 mL.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 17.3 K/μL, hemoglobin (Hb) is 7.7 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) is 139 K/μL, and creatinine (Cr) is 5.2 mg/dL.
* Microbiology: The patient's blood culture is positive for GNR, and C. difficile is also positive.
* Physical examination: The patient is awake and alert, but uncomfortable with movement. He has a right femoral line in place, and a small splinter hemorrhage in his left thumbnail.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications are as follows:

* Sepsis/Pseudomonas bacteremia: The patient is at risk for sepsis and bacteremia due to his positive blood cultures and clinical symptoms.
* GPCs in blood: The patient may have a gram-positive bacteremia, which could be contaminant or a true infection.
* Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac events.
* ESRD on HD: The patient requires new lines for dialysis, and may need temporary line placement if unable to wait for surveillance cultures.
* PVD: The patient has a history of PVD, and may require further management for this condition.
* Back pain: The patient has chronic back pain, which may be related to his underlying medical conditions or other factors.
* CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, and may require further management for this condition.
* DM: The patient has a history of DM, and may require further management for this condition.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing ceftaz, gentamicin, and metronidazole antibiotics for 4 weeks.
* Confirming ceftaz with the ID team given HD dosing and difficulty of checking levels.
* Considering abdominal imaging to rule out other collections.
* Considering repeat L spine imaging to rule out abscess given back pain and bacteremia.
* Monitoring for signs of endocarditis and considering TEE later this week.
* Trending surveillance blood cultures and catheter tip cultures.
* Maintaining the femoral line for pressors and antibiotics for now.
* Attempting to place a peripheral line earlier rather than later.
* Continuing vancomycin dosed per HD for gram-positive bacteremia.
* Redrawing blood cultures and following up with cultures from OSH.
* Continuing to monitor BPs and considering further management for hypotension.
* Continuing pentoxifylline for PVD.
* Continuing aspirin and statin for CAD.
* Managing DM with humalog SS.
* Repeating Hct and trending PRN for drop in Hct.
* Transfusing for <22 if necessary.
* Providing prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin and pneumoboots.
* Monitoring for VAP and stress ulcer.
* Continuing code status as full.
* Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis.
   Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive UTI.
   Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur on
   exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Culture
   positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (likely pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD and EJ lines have been removed; femoral line remains in place.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Ceftaz, Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent
   should continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Confirm Ceftaz with ID team given HD dosing and difficulty of
   checking levels; will check [**Last Name (un) **] sensitivities when newest culture is
   speciated
   - Consider abdominal imaging per ID recs to rule out other collections
   - Consider repeat L spine imaging to rule out abscess given back pain,
   bacteremia
   - F/U US of pacer/AICD pocket (done yesterday, no read)
   - Monitor for signs of endocarditis; TEE later this week for higher
   quality imaging
   - Consider TTE today per ID recs
   - Trend surveillence blood cultures, catheter tip cultures
   - Removed HD line [**4-23**] by IR
 tip culture pending
   - Plan to maintain femoral line for pressors/abx for now; remove EJ
   line; plan for line holiday until cx clear for 24 hours (culture tips)
   - Attempt to place peripheral line earlier rather than later as patient
   will become more edematous with time
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - Consider pain consult if sx worsen
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   8. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   9. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, renal/cardiac diabetic diet as

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   should continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Confirm Ceftaz with ID team given HD dosing and difficulty of
   checking levels; will check [**Last Name (un) **] sensitivities when newest culture is
   speciated
   - Consider abdominal imaging per ID recs to rule out other collections
   - Consider repeat L spine imaging to rule out abscess given back pain,
   bacteremia
   - F/U US of pacer/AICD pocket (done yesterday, no read)
   - Monitor for signs of endocarditis; TEE later this week for higher
   quality imaging
   - Consider TTE today per ID recs
   - Trend surveillence blood cultures, catheter tip cultures
   - Removed HD line [**4-23**] by IR
 tip culture pending
   - Plan to maintain femoral line for pressors/abx for now; remove EJ
   line; plan for line holiday until cx clear for 24 hours (culture tips)
   - Attempt to place peripheral line earlier rather than later as patient
   will become more edematous with time
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   6. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - Consider pain consult if sx worsen
   .
   7. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   8. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   9. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, renal/cardiac diabetic diet as

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Sepsis/Pseudomonas bacteremia: The patient has been diagnosed with pseudomonas bacteremia, which is likely acquired from the urine source. The patient has been treated with ceftazidime, gentamicin, and metronidazole, and cultures are pending. The patient's femoral line remains in place, and the HD and EJ lines have been removed.
2. GPCs in blood: The patient has GPCs in their blood, which may be contaminated or a sign of gram-positive bacteremia. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, and blood cultures have been redrawn.
3. Hypotension: The patient has required pressors to maintain blood pressure, and the differential includes sepsis, hypovolemia, and cardiac event. The patient's cardiac enzymes and ECG are normal, but an echo showed new wall motion abnormalities.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient requires a new line placement after the line holiday (48 hours culture negative) for bacteremia. If unable to wait for surveillance cultures, a temporary line placement may be necessary.
5. PVD: The patient has chronic PVD and is being treated with pentoxifylline.
6. Back pain: The patient has chronic back pain, which is more severe in the past week. A CT scan did not show an epidural abscess, and the patient is being managed with pain control and physical therapy.
7. CAD: The patient has CAD and is being treated with aspirin and statin.
8. DM: The patient has DM and is being managed with insulin therapy.
9. Drop in Hct: The patient's Hct has dropped, which may be due to dilutional effects. The patient is being monitored for signs of active bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued sepsis and bacteremia
* Endocarditis
* Gram-positive bacteremia
* Hypotension and cardiovascular instability
* ESRD on HD and the need for new line placement
* PVD and the risk of limb loss
* Back pain and the risk of epidural abscess
* CAD and the risk of myocardial infarction
* DM and the risk of hypoglycemia
* Drop in Hct and the risk of bleeding

The patient's current plan includes:

* Continuing antibiotics and antifungals as directed
* Monitoring for signs of sepsis and bacteremia
* Maintaining blood pressure with pressors as necessary
* Placing a new line after the line holiday for bacteremia
* Managing pain with medications and physical therapy
* Monitoring for signs of endocarditis
* Continuing to monitor for signs of gram-positive bacteremia
* Monitoring for signs of hypotension and cardiovascular instability
* Managing ESRD on HD and the need for new line placement
* Managing PVD and the risk of limb loss
* Managing back pain and the risk of epidural abscess
* Managing CAD and the risk of myocardial infarction
* Managing DM and the risk of hypoglycemia
* Monitoring for signs of bleeding and managing as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with a PSA line infection and bacteremia. He has been doing well off pressors and has not shown any signs of organ dysfunction.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 111/56 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery.

The patient's physical examination is also stable, with no acute distress, normal breath sounds, and soft, non-tender abdomen. His extremities show right lower extremity edema and left lower extremity edema, both at a level of 2+.

Laboratory results show the following:

* Hemoglobin: 7.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 17.3
* Platelet count: 139
* Creatinine: 5.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 39 mg/dL
* Glucose: 147 mg/dL
* Other labs show normal or slightly elevated levels.

The patient's microbiology results show that 4 out of 14 sets of blood cultures were positive for PSA.

The assessment and plan include the following:

* Sepsis without organ dysfunction: change ceftaz to meropenem and gentamicin, and perform a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) today.
* Renal failure, end-stage: temporary line tomorrow or Sunday.
* Impaired skin integrity: continue to monitor and manage.
* C. diff: continue flagyl PO.
* Pain: get pain consult to make suggestions for back pain.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to transfer to the floor."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight on hospital day 1 several hours after
   dialysis.  Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has
   positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt
   has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He had been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Culture positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD, femoral, and EJ lines have been removed. HD line growing GNR.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Changed ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem until patient
   back on HD
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - PICC line in place
   - F/U on TTE; TEE likely next week.
   - F/U pacer/AICD pocket ultrasound
 No evidence of fluid collection or
   abscess in the right chest.
   - consider repeat L spine imaging
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redraw blood cultures daily
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Pt hypotensive this morning [**4-25**] to systolics in 70s-80s; given 250
   cc fluid bolus.  Not tachycardic, had been given opiates so this may
   have contributed.
   - Hold tamsulosin as may be contributing to hypotension
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - surveillance blood cultures
   - PICC line in place
   - F/U on TTE; TEE likely next week.
   - F/U pacer/AICD pocket ultrasound
 No evidence of fluid collection or
   abscess in the right chest.
   - consider repeat L spine imaging
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redraw blood cultures daily
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Pt hypotensive this morning [**4-25**] to systolics in 70s-80s; given 250
   cc fluid bolus.  Not tachycardic, had been given opiates so this may
   have contributed.
   - Hold tamsulosin as may be contributing to hypotension
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on Hemodialysis (HD), Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). He was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with Pseudomonas and Gram-Positive Cocci (GPC) bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including the removal of HD, femoral, and EJ lines, and the placement of a new PICC line. He has been started on meropenem and gentamycin for Pseudomonas bacteremia, and flagyl for C. difficile associated disease.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.4°C, HR 68 bpm, BP 93/53 mmHg, RR 11 inspirations per minute, SpO2 97%.
* Laboratory results: WBC 17.3, Hct 28.3, Plt 139, Cr 5.2, Glucose 147.
* Physical examination: Awake and alert, comfortable, and in no acute distress. Right EJ line removed, no erythema or tenderness at site. Multiple lesions on feet appear to be healing.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to Pseudomonas bacteremia
* Endocarditis due to GPC bacteremia
* Hypotension and hypovolemia due to fluid loss and sepsis
* C. difficile associated disease
* ESRD on HD: need for new line placement after line holiday (48 hours culture negative) for bacteremia
* PVD: need for continued Pentoxifylline therapy
* CAD: need for continued aspirin and statin therapy
* DM: need for continued insulin therapy and monitoring of blood glucose levels
* Drop in Hct: need for repeat Hct and trend PRN
* Chronic back pain: need for continued pain control and monitoring
* CAD: need for continued aspirin and statin therapy

Recommendations:

* Continue gentamycin and flagyl for Pseudomonas and C. difficile associated disease, respectively
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and septic shock
* Continue to monitor BP and fluid status
* Consider repeat L spine imaging to evaluate for abscess or epidural abscess
* Continue Pentoxifylline therapy for PVD
* Continue aspirin and statin therapy for CAD
* Continue insulin therapy and monitoring of blood glucose levels for DM
* Repeat Hct and trend PRN to evaluate for drop in Hct
* Continue pain control and monitoring for chronic back pain
* Consider temporary line placement if unable to wait for surveillance cx"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis.
   Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive UTI.
   Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur on
   exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He had been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Culture
   positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so far.
   HD, femoral, and EJ lines have been removed. HD line growing GNR.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Change ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem until patient
   back on HD
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - PICC line in place
   -  f/u on TTE; TEE likely next week.
   - F/U pacer/AICD pocket  ultrasound
 No evidence of fluid collection
   or abscess in the right chest.
   - consider repeat L spine imaging
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redraw blood cultures daily
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis.
   Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive UTI.
   Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur on
   exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He had been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Culture
   positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so far.
   HD, femoral, and EJ lines have been removed. HD line growing GNR.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Change ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem until patient
   back on HD
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - PICC line in place
   -  f/u on TTE; TEE likely next week.
   - F/U pacer/AICD pocket  ultrasound
 No evidence of fluid collection
   or abscess in the right chest.
   - consider repeat L spine imaging
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redraw blood cultures daily
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, renal/cardiac diabetic diet as
   tolerated; 1500 cc fluid restriction daily
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots
   # Access: Femoral CVL

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), chronic heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with sepsis and pseudomonas bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever. The patient has a history of ESRD on HD, CHF, PVD, DM, and CAD. He was transferred from another hospital with pseudomonas and GPC bacteremia.

The patient's current condition is:

* Fever and hypotension overnight
* Positive urine culture for pseudomonas
* Cultures from HD, femoral, and EJ lines are positive for GNR
* Abdominal CT scan shows no evidence of fluid collection or abscess in the right chest
* Patient is on meropenem and gentamycin for pseudomonas and GPC bacteremia
* Patient is on Flagyl for C. difficile-associated disease
* Patient is on Pentoxifylline for PVD
* Patient is on aspirin and statin for CAD
* Patient is on Humalog SS for DM

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis/Pseudomonas bacteremia: The patient's sepsis and bacteremia may lead to further complications such as organ failure, shock, and death.
2. Gram-positive bacteremia: The patient's positive blood cultures for GPC may indicate a secondary infection, which could lead to further complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be caused by sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac event, and may lead to organ failure, shock, and death.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient's ESRD on HD may lead to further complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalance, and cardiovascular events.
5. C. difficile-associated disease: The patient's C. difficile-associated disease may lead to further complications such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and electrolyte imbalance.
6. PVD: The patient's PVD may lead to further complications such as claudication, rest pain, and gangrene.
7. CAD: The patient's CAD may lead to further complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
8. DM: The patient's DM may lead to further complications such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for pseudomonas and GPC bacteremia
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely
3. Consider repeat imaging studies to evaluate for further complications
4. Continue to manage the patient's fluid and electrolyte status
5. Consider consultation with neurosurgery and cardiology to evaluate the patient's back pain and cardiac status
6. Continue to manage the patient's pain and discomfort
7. Consider consultation with nephrology to evaluate the patient's ESRD on HD
8. Continue to monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight on hospital day 1 several hours after
   dialysis.  Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has
   positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt
   has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He had been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Culture positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD, femoral, and EJ lines have been removed. HD line growing GNR.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Changed ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem until patient
   back on HD
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - PICC line in place
   - F/U on TTE; TEE likely next week.
   - F/U pacer/AICD pocket ultrasound
 No evidence of fluid collection or
   abscess in the right chest.
   - consider repeat L spine imaging
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redraw blood cultures daily
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Pt hypotensive this morning [**4-25**] to systolics in 70s-80s; given 250
   cc fluid bolus.  Not tachycardic, had been given opiates so this may
   have contributed.
   - Hold tamsulosin as may be contributing to hypotension
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 70-year-old male with ESRD on HD, CHF, PVD, DM, and CAD, who was transferred to the ICU with pseudomonas and GPC bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
* The patient has a PICC line in place, which was placed due to difficulty advancing the catheter tip to the distal SVC.
* The patient's blood cultures are positive for GNR, and the femoral and EJ lines have been removed.
* The patient is currently on gentamycin, Flagyl, and meropenem for antibiotic treatment.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, and blood pressure of 93/53 mmHg.
* The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 139 K/uL.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Sepsis/Pseudomonas Bacteremia:** The patient's bacteremia is likely acquired from the urine source, and the PICC line is infected. The patient's hypotension and fever overnight suggest ongoing sepsis.
2. **Gram-Positive Bacteremia:** The patient's blood cultures are also positive for GPC, which may be contaminating or a true bacteremia.
3. **Hypotension:** The patient's hypotension is likely secondary to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac event, but the echo did not show any significant cardiac changes.
4. **ESRD on HD:** The patient will need a new line placed after the current line holiday (48 hours culture-negative) for bacteremia.
5. **C. Diff-Associated Disease:** The patient is being treated with Flagyl for C. Diff-associated disease.
6. **PVD:** The patient is being treated with Pentoxifylline for PVD.
7. **Back Pain:** The patient's back pain is likely chronic, but the CT scan at OSH did not show an epidural abscess.
8. **CAD:** The patient is being treated with aspirin and statin for CAD, and the b-blocker is being held due to hypotension.
9. **DM:** The patient is being treated with Humalog SS for DM, and is at risk for hypoglycemia during HD.
10. **Drop in Hct:** The patient's Hct is dropping, possibly due to dilutional effects, and will need to be monitored and transfused if necessary.

**Recommendations:**

* Continue antibiotic treatment with gentamycin, Flagyl, and meropenem.
* Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
* Consider repeat imaging for endocarditis and pseudomonas infection.
* Continue to manage the patient's hypotension and fluid status.
* Monitor the patient's Hct and consider transfusion if necessary.
* Continue to manage the patient's DM and CAD.
* Consider repeat L spine imaging for PVD."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis.
   Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive UTI.
   Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur on
   exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Culture
   positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (likely pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD and EJ lines have been removed; femoral line remains in place.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - check gent level
   - Change ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - place PICC line then D/C femoral line
   -  TTE or TEE to evaluate for endocarditis
   - F/U pacer/AICD pocket  ultrasound
   - consider repeat L spine imaging
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight several hours after dialysis.
   Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has positive UTI.
   Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt has mumur on
   exam, he states this has been present in the past and concern for
   endocarditis is low.  He has been on ceftaz for 2 days.  Unclear where
   the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected. Culture
   positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (likely pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD and EJ lines have been removed; femoral line remains in place.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - check gent level
   - Change ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem
   - surveillance blood cultures
   - place PICC line then D/C femoral line
   -  TTE or TEE to evaluate for endocarditis
   - F/U pacer/AICD pocket  ultrasound
   - consider repeat L spine imaging
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - continue vancomycin dosed per HD
   - redrawn blood cultures
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, now off of pressors. Differential includes sepsis
   given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of dialysis.  Cardiac
   event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG changes, although
   echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the anterior wall,
   septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again overnight to SBPs
   in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD so could be
   secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile and episode
   several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   - Consider pain consult if sx worsen
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, CHF, PVD, DM, and CAD, who was transferred from another hospital with pseudomonas and GPC bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.

The patient has been experiencing hypotension and fever, and the bacteremia is likely acquired from the urine source. The patient has been on ceftaz for 2 days, and the culture is positive for GNR, which is likely pseudomonas. The patient has also been experiencing pain, and the pain service has been consulted.

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 17.3

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2167-4-25**] 09:27 AM
   - Patient became hypotensive into 60s (asymptomatic). Vasopressin
   started.
   - CT abd/pelvis non-contrast looking for abdominal source: New small to
   moderate bilateral pleural effusions with simple fluid attenuation,
   there is associate compressive atelectasis.  There has been prior
   mediastinotomy.  Pacer wires seen.  Coronary artery calcifications.
   Large stones in gallbladder (unchanged).  Cystic lesions in pancreas.
   Left upper pole mass, left lower pole cyst, right heterogeneous lower
   pole lesions are poorly evaluated.
   No free air in abdomen.  Mild diffuse mesenteric stranding and
   anasarca. No RP lymphadenopathy.
   1. no acute intraabdominal/pelvic process to explain symptoms
   2. multiple pancreatic/renal lesions
   3. cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
   4. new small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions
   TTE:
   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
   normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction ?
   30 percent). The estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2).
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
   leaflets are moderately thickened. The aortic valve is not well seen.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be
   fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is at least mild
   aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No obvious vegetations;
   significant left ventricular contractile dysfunction and aortic
   stenosis
   CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
   echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight on hospital day 1 several hours after
   dialysis.  Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has
   positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt
   has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He had been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Culture positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD, femoral, and EJ lines have been removed. HD line growing GNR.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Changed ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem until patient
   back on HD
   - surveillance blood cultures daily
   - PICC line in place
   - suboptimal TTE; TEE likely next week.
   - pacer/AICD pocket ultrasound
 No evidence of fluid collection or
   abscess in the right chest.
   - Abd/pelvis CT without appreciable abscess or cause for sepsis
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - discontinue vancomycin dosed per HD for now
   - redraw blood cultures daily
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, off of pressors transiently and now. Differential
   includes sepsis given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of
   dialysis.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG
   changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the
   anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   and episode several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued
   sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Hold tamsulosin as may be contributing to hypotension
   - wean vasopressin as tolerated
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - likely temporary HD placement tomorrow followed by dialysis (line by
   renal team)
   - monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   - still with urine in bladder
 bladder scan today and straight cath as
   needed
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn (start with 2.5 mg as 5 mg caused
   oversedation), standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2167-4-25**] 09:27 AM
   - Patient became hypotensive into 60s (asymptomatic). Vasopressin
   started.
   - CT abd/pelvis non-contrast looking for abdominal source: New small to
   moderate bilateral pleural effusions with simple fluid attenuation,
   there is associate compressive atelectasis.  There has been prior
   mediastinotomy.  Pacer wires seen.  Coronary artery calcifications.
   Large stones in gallbladder (unchanged).  Cystic lesions in pancreas.
   Left upper pole mass, left lower pole cyst, right heterogeneous lower
   pole lesions are poorly evaluated.
   No free air in abdomen.  Mild diffuse mesenteric stranding and
   anasarca. No RP lymphadenopathy.
   1. no acute intraabdominal/pelvic process to explain symptoms
   2. multiple pancreatic/renal lesions
   3. cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
   4. new small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions
   TTE:
   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
   normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction ?
   30 percent). The estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2).
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
   leaflets are moderately thickened. The aortic valve is not well seen.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be
   fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is at least mild
   aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No obvious vegetations;
   significant left ventricular contractile dysfunction and aortic
   stenosis

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight on hospital day 1 several hours after
   dialysis.  Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has
   positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt
   has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He had been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Culture positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD, femoral, and EJ lines have been removed. HD line growing GNR.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Changed ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem until patient
   back on HD
   - surveillance blood cultures daily
   - PICC line in place
   - suboptimal TTE; TEE likely next week.
   - pacer/AICD pocket ultrasound
 No evidence of fluid collection or
   abscess in the right chest.
   - Abd/pelvis CT without appreciable abscess or cause for sepsis
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - discontinue vancomycin dosed per HD for now
   - redraw blood cultures daily
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, off of pressors transiently and now. Differential
   includes sepsis given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of
   dialysis.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG
   changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the
   anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   and episode several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued
   sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Hold tamsulosin as may be contributing to hypotension
   - wean vasopressin as tolerated
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - likely temporary HD placement tomorrow followed by dialysis (line by
   renal team)
   - monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   - still with urine in bladder
 bladder scan today and straight cath as
   needed
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn (start with 2.5 mg as 5 mg caused
   oversedation), standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), chronic heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was transferred from another hospital with pseudomonas and gram-positive cocci (GPC) bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* Heart rate: 60 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 103/67 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 11 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 95%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 17.3 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 28.3%
* Platelet count: 139 K/uL
* Creatinine: 5.2 mg/dL
* Glucose: 147 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.2 g/dL
* LDH: 251 IU/L
* Calcium: 6.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.3 mg/dL

The patient has undergone several medical interventions, including:

* Hemodialysis
* Removal of HD, femoral, and EJ lines
* Placement of a PICC line
* Administration of antibiotics (Gent, Flagyl)
* Surveillance blood cultures daily
* Monitoring of electrolytes

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Sepsis and bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia is likely acquired from a urinary source, and the presence of GPC in blood cultures suggests a possible contaminant.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac event, and is being managed with vasopressors and fluid administration.
3. End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis: The patient requires ongoing dialysis and may need a new line placement after the current line holiday.
4. Chronic heart failure: The patient's CHF is likely contributing to his hypotension and may require further management.
5. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient's PVD may be contributing to his hypotension and may require further management.
6. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's DM may be contributing to his hypoglycemia during HD and requires ongoing management.
7. Coronary artery disease: The patient's CAD may be contributing to his hypotension and requires ongoing management.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac event: The patient's echocardiogram showed new wall motion abnormalities, which may indicate a cardiac event.
2. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and sepsis may worsen and require further management.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen and require further management.
4. End-stage renal disease: The patient's ESRD may worsen and require further management.
5. Chronic heart failure: The patient's CHF may worsen and require further management.
6. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient's PVD may worsen and require further management.
7. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's DM may worsen and require further management.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, I recommend the following:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy for sepsis and bacteremia.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely for signs of worsening sepsis or cardiac event.
3. Manage the patient's hypotension with vasopressors and fluid administration as needed.
4. Continue hemodialysis and monitor the patient's electrolytes and fluid status.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider further management for CHF and CAD.
6. Monitor the patient's PVD and consider further management as needed.
7. Manage the patient's DM and consider further management as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's renal status and consider further management as needed.
9. Consider further imaging studies (e.g., echocardiogram, CT scan) to evaluate the patient's cardiac and vascular status.
10. Consider consulting with specialists (e.g., cardiologist, nephrologist, infectious disease specialist) for further management and guidance."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight on hospital day 1 several hours after
   dialysis.  Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has
   positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt
   has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He had been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Culture positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD, femoral, and EJ lines have been removed. HD line growing GNR.
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Changed ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem until patient
   back on HD
   - surveillance blood cultures daily
   - PICC line in place
   - suboptimal TTE; TEE likely next week.
   - pacer/AICD pocket ultrasound
 No evidence of fluid collection or
   abscess in the right chest.
   - Abd/pelvis CT without appreciable abscess or cause for sepsis
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - discontinue vancomycin dosed per HD for now
   - redraw blood cultures daily
   - f/u cultures from OSH
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, off of pressors transiently and now. Differential
   includes sepsis given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of
   dialysis.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG
   changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the
   anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   and episode several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued
   sepsis.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Hold tamsulosin as may be contributing to hypotension
   - wean vasopressin as tolerated
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - likely temporary HD placement tomorrow followed by dialysis
   - monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   - still with urine in bladder
 bladder scan today and straight cath as
   needed
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn, standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, renal/cardiac diabetic diet as
   tolerated; 1500 cc fluid restriction daily
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, pneumoboots

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 TRANSTHORACIC ECHO - At [**2167-4-25**] 09:27 AM
   - Patient became hypotensive into 60s (asymptomatic). Vasopressin
   started.
   - CT abd/pelvis non-contrast looking for abdominal source: New small to
   moderate bilateral pleural effusions with simple fluid attenuation,
   there is associate compressive atelectasis.  There has been prior
   mediastinotomy.  Pacer wires seen.  Coronary artery calcifications.
   Large stones in gallbladder (unchanged).  Cystic lesions in pancreas.
   Left upper pole mass, left lower pole cyst, right heterogeneous lower
   pole lesions are poorly evaluated.
   No free air in abdomen.  Mild diffuse mesenteric stranding and
   anasarca. No RP lymphadenopathy.
   1. no acute intraabdominal/pelvic process to explain symptoms
   2. multiple pancreatic/renal lesions
   3. cholelithiasis without cholecystitis.
   4. new small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions
   TTE:
   The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
   normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. LV systolic function appears depressed (ejection fraction ?
   30 percent). The estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2).
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be determined. The aortic valve
   leaflets are moderately thickened. The aortic valve is not well seen.
   No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be
   fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. There is at least mild
   aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No obvious vegetations;
   significant left ventricular contractile dysfunction and aortic
   stenosis
   CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
   echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), chronic heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was transferred from another hospital with pseudomonas and GPC bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever. The patient's current condition is complicated by sepsis, GPC bacteremia, hypotension, and ESRD on HD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) and may be complicated by bacteremia, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. GPC Bacteremia: The patient's GPC bacteremia may be contaminant or a true infection, which can lead to further complications such as endocarditis, osteomyelitis, or sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac event, which can lead to organ failure and death.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient's ESRD on HD requires close monitoring of electrolytes, fluid balance, and blood pressure to prevent complications such as hypertension, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. C. Diff associated disease: The patient's C. Diff associated disease may lead to further complications such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and sepsis.
6. PVD: The patient's PVD may lead to further complications such as claudication, rest pain, and gangrene.
7. Back Pain: The patient's back pain may be due to a variety of causes, including musculoskeletal strain, spinal stenosis, or herniated disc, which can lead to further complications such as nerve damage, numbness, and weakness.
8. CAD: The patient's CAD may lead to further complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and heart failure.
9. DM: The patient's DM may lead to further complications such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis.
10. Drop in Hct: The patient's drop in Hct may be due to dilutional anemia or active bleeding, which can lead to further complications such as anemia, fatigue, and shortness of breath.

ICU Care:

The patient requires close monitoring in the ICU for the above-mentioned complications. The patient's care should include:

* Close monitoring of vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
* Frequent assessment of the patient's neurological status, including level of consciousness, pupillary response, and motor function.
* Monitoring of laboratory values, including complete blood count, electrolyte levels, and blood urea nitrogen.
* Administration of antibiotics and antifungals as necessary.
* Management of pain and discomfort, including administration of analgesics and sedatives.
* Monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels, including administration of IV fluids and electrolyte supplements as necessary.
* Monitoring of cardiac function, including administration of medications to control heart rate and blood pressure.
* Monitoring of respiratory function, including administration of oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as necessary.
* Monitoring of gastrointestinal function, including administration of anti-diarrheal medications and anti-nausea medications as necessary.
* Monitoring of renal function, including administration of dialysis and electrolyte supplements as necessary.
* Monitoring of blood glucose levels, including administration of insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents as necessary.
* Monitoring of electrolyte levels, including administration of electrolyte supplements as necessary.
* Monitoring of medication side effects, including administration of medications to manage side effects as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with septic shock and pseudomonal bacteremia. He has been receiving vasopressin to manage his blood pressure, which was weaned off overnight. He is still intermittently requiring vasopressin. His back pain has improved, and he is currently pain-free. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 103/67 mmHg, heart rate of 60 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.3, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 139,000/μL. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal failure. His liver function tests (LFTs) are normal, and his electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient has resolving shock, impaired skin integrity, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. He is at risk for developing further complications, including renal failure, respiratory failure, and septic shock. The plan is to continue his antibiotic therapy, manage his pain with oxycodone, and provide nutrition and glycemic control. He will also require close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's BUN and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal failure. This could lead to further complications, including electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen therapy, which may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation. He may require more aggressive respiratory support, such as mechanical ventilation.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is not yet fully resolved, and he may be at risk for developing further complications, including septic shock and organ dysfunction.
4. Infection: The patient's pseudomonal bacteremia may not be fully treated, and he may be at risk for developing further infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections.
5. Pain: The patient's pain is currently well-controlled, but he may require further pain management to prevent complications, such as increased risk of respiratory failure.
6. Skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to further complications, including skin breakdown and infection.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but he may be at risk for developing electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypocalcemia, due to his renal failure.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight on hospital day 1 several hours after
   dialysis.  Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has
   positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt
   has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He had been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Culture positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD, femoral, and EJ lines have been removed. HD line growing
   pseudomonas. Pacer/AICD pocket ultrasound
 No evidence of fluid
   collection or abscess in the right chest. Abd/pelvis CT without
   appreciable abscess or cause for sepsis
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Changed ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem until patient
   back on HD
   - Surveillance blood cultures daily (given 5 days negative, can stop
   trending)
   - PICC line in place
   - Suboptimal TTE; TEE likely next week.
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - discontinue vancomycin dosed per HD for now
   - redraw blood cultures daily
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, off of pressors transiently and now. Differential
   includes sepsis given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of
   dialysis.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG
   changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the
   anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   and episode several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued
   sepsis. Currently off of all pressors.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Hold tamsulosin as may be contributing to hypotension
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - plan for temporary HD placement today followed by dialysis (line by
   renal team)

   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   - still with urine in bladder
 bladder scan today and straight cath as

   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn (start with 2.5 mg as 5 mg caused
   oversedation), standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was transferred to the ICU with pseudomonas and GPC bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including the removal of HD, femoral, and EJ lines, and the placement of a PICC line. He has also been started on gentamicin and metronidazole for treatment of his bacteremia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 44.1
* Hct: 30.5
* Plt: 190
* Cr: 3.1
* Glucose: 117
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.3/31.7/1.1, Ca++: 6.8 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 4.9 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* HR: 60 (60-68) bpm
* BP: 111/61 (70-122/65) mmHg
* RR: 16 (9-26) inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 96%

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General: Awake and alert, comfortable, and in no acute distress
* HEENT: No abnormalities
* CV: Regular rhythm, 2/6 SEM throughout precordium
* Lungs/chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, and non-distended
* Extremities: Multiple lesions on feet appear to be healing, arms wrapped in gauze with multiple skin tears/trauma from blood draws

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to bacteremia
* Endocarditis due to the presence of a murmur on examination
* GPC bacteremia and subsequent complications
* Hypotension due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac event
* ESRD and associated electrolyte imbalances
* C. difficile-associated disease
* PVD and potential complications such as peripheral artery occlusion
* CAD and potential complications such as myocardial infarction
* DM and potential complications such as hypoglycemia
* Drop in Hct due to dilutional or hemorrhagic causes

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue gentamicin and metronidazole for treatment of bacteremia

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12630**] is a 70yo M w/hx of ESRD on HD, CHF (EF 30-35%), PVD, DM, CAD
   who was transferred from [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 3**] with pseudomonas and GPC
   bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever.
   .
   1. Sepsis/Psuedomonas bacteremia: Normotensive on presentation, but
   febrile and hypotensive overnight on hospital day 1 several hours after
   dialysis.  Bacteremia likely acquired from urine source as pt has
   positive UTI.  Echo done at OSH negative for vegetations.  Although pt
   has mumur on exam, he states this has been present in the past and
   concern for endocarditis is low.  He had been on ceftaz for 2 days.
   Unclear where the pseudomonas is growing, but likely line is infected.
   Culture positive for GNR on [**4-22**] (pseudomonas) in [**1-12**] aerobic bottle so
   far. HD, femoral, and EJ lines have been removed. HD line growing
   pseudomonas. Pacer/AICD pocket ultrasound
 No evidence of fluid
   collection or abscess in the right chest. Abd/pelvis CT without
   appreciable abscess or cause for sepsis
   - Follow up ID recommendations (appreciated!)
   - Continue Gent, Flagyl (will need 4 week course of Abx; Gent should
   continue at least until BCx clear)
   - Changed ceftaz (difficulty with HD dosing) to meropenem until patient
   back on HD
   - Surveillance blood cultures daily (given 5 days negative, can stop
   trending)
   - PICC line in place
   - Suboptimal TTE; TEE likely next week (scheduled for Wednesday).
   - daily EKG
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - discontinue vancomycin dosed per HD for now
   - redraw blood cultures daily
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, off of pressors transiently and now. Differential
   includes sepsis given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of
   dialysis.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG
   changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the
   anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   and episode several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued
   sepsis. Currently off of all pressors.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Hold tamsulosin as may be contributing to hypotension (consider
   restart if BP tolerates)
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - plan for temporary HD placement today followed by dialysis (line by
   renal team)
   - monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   - still with urine in bladder
 bladder scan today and straight cath as
   needed
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn (start with 2.5 mg as 5 mg caused
   oversedation), standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   - PICC line in place
   - Suboptimal TTE; TEE likely next week (scheduled for Wednesday).
   - daily EKG
   .
   2. GPCs in blood: Possibly contaminate given it is in [**1-12**] bottles.
   Other concern is for gram positive bacteremia
   - discontinue vancomycin dosed per HD for now
   - redraw blood cultures daily
   .
   3. Hypotension: pt required dopamine gtt which was weaned yesterday;
   then on levophed, off of pressors transiently and now. Differential
   includes sepsis given bactermia vs hypovolemia given setting of
   dialysis.  Cardiac event seems unlikely given negative enzymes or ECG
   changes, although echo did show new wall motion abnormalities in the
   anterior wall, septum and apex. Patient developed hypotension again
   overnight to SBPs in 70s
 started on Levophed. This occurred post-HD
   so could be secondary to hypovolemia, but given patient also febrile
   and episode several hours post-dialysis concerning for continued
   sepsis. Currently off of all pressors.
   - Continue to monitor BPs
   - Hold tamsulosin as may be contributing to hypotension (consider
   restart if BP tolerates)
   .
   4. ESRD on HD: will need new line placed after line holiday (48 hours
   culture negative) for bacteremia.  If unable to wait for surveillance
   cx (definite possibility per renal note), will need temporary line
   placement.
   - renal dialysis team consulting
 appreciate recs!
   - f/u cultures
   - HD line removed [**4-23**]
   - plan for temporary HD placement today followed by dialysis (line by
   renal team)
   - monitor electrolytes [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - nephrocaps, phos binder with calcium, sevelamer
   - 1500 cc fluid restriction
   - still with urine in bladder
 bladder scan today and straight cath as
   needed
   .
   5.  C. Diff associated disease
    - continue flagyl
   -  f/u ID recs
   6. PVD: continue Pentoxifylline
   .
   7. Back Pain: appears chronic per patient although more severe in the
   past 1 week.  CT scan at OSH does not show epidural abscess.  Exam not
   concerning for abscess, cord compression or cauda equina syndrome.
   Ultram appears to be sedating to him.  Was seen as OSH by neurosurgery
   who recommended CT scan.
   - continue to monitor
   - pain control with oxycodone prn (start with 2.5 mg as 5 mg caused
   oversedation), standing tylenol
   - lidocaine patch
   - PT consult
   .
   8. CAD: continue aspirin, statin
   - hold b-blocker in the setting of hypotension
   .
   9. DM: has been hypoglycemic during HD. Not currently on any oral
   hyperglycemic agents.
   - humalog SS
   10. Drop in Hct: Possibly dilutional given all cell lines decreased
   today. No signs of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac all stools
   - Repeat Hct, trend PRN
   - Transfuse for < 22 (would avoid the extra fluid if possible)
   .

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old male with ESRD on HD, CHF, PVD, DM, and CAD who was transferred to the ICU with pseudomonas and GPC bacteremia associated with hypotension and fever. He has been treated with antibiotics, including ceftaz and meropenem, and has had several lines removed, including the HD line, which was growing pseudomonas. He has also been treated with gentamicin and flagyl. The patient's current condition is stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, and blood pressure of 111/61 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and hypotension overnight suggest that sepsis is a possible complication.
2. Line infection: The growth of pseudomonas in the HD line suggests that the line may be infected, which could lead to further complications.
3. GPC bacteremia: The patient's GPC bacteremia may be a contaminant, but it could also be a sign of a more serious infection.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or cardiac event, and requires close monitoring.
5. ESRD on HD: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing HD, and the plan is to place a temporary line after the current line is removed.
6. C. Diff associated disease: The patient's C. diff infection requires continued treatment with flagyl and monitoring for further complications.
7. PVD: The patient's PVD requires continued treatment with pentoxifylline.
8. Back pain: The patient's back pain may be chronic, but it could also be related to an underlying infection or other condition.
9. CAD: The patient's CAD requires continued treatment with aspirin and statin.
10. DM: The patient's DM requires ongoing treatment with insulin and monitoring for hypoglycemia.

The patient's medical condition is complex, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is currently in the ICU with a temporary HD line scheduled for tomorrow. They have a gentamicin level of 1.9, which is above the therapeutic range, and will require redosing when the level falls below 1.8. The patient has been receiving meropenem and metronidazole antibiotics, and is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 60-68 bpm, blood pressure of 111/61 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Their oxygen saturation is 96% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 44.1-10.0 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 7.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 190-168 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.1-6.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 117-188 mg/dL
* Glucose: 55-117 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, differential, and lactic acid levels are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, except for a slight increase in their blood pressure.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

* Delayed or inadequate treatment of the patient's underlying infection due to the gentamicin level being above the therapeutic range.
* Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's low platelet count and the presence of heparin sodium.
* Potential for further decline in renal function due to the patient's high creatinine levels.
* Risk of electrolyte imbalances due to the patient's high blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.
* Risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to the patient's fluctuating glucose levels.
* Risk of respiratory failure due to the patient's high respiratory rate and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old man with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) who has been treated for septic shock caused by a pseudomonal HD catheter infection. The patient's condition has resolved, and he is no longer receiving vasopressor support.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* Heart rate: 60 bpm
* Blood pressure: 99/54 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: normal

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 44.1 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 30.5%
* Platelet count: 190 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL
* Glucose: 97 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: no acute distress
* Cardiovascular: normal heart sounds
* Respiratory: symmetric chest expansion, crackles in the bases, and scattered rhonchi
* Abdominal: soft and non-tender
* Extremities: trace edema in both lower extremities
* Skin: warm
* Neurologic: attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to stimuli

The patient's medical history and review of systems are unchanged from admission, except for the resolution of septic shock.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continued treatment for C. diff with metronidazole
* Pain management with oxycodone as needed
* Follow-up with the pain service
* Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer
* Monitoring for VAP
* Transfer to the floor for further care

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Renal failure progression
* Skin integrity issues
* Infection recurrence
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure
* Neurologic complications, such as seizures or stroke
* Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiomyopathy
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation
* Wound complications, such as infection or dehiscence

It is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed to prevent and manage these potential complications."
