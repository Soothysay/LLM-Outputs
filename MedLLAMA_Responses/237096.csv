   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  55yo woman with ESRD and h/o C diff admitted with hypotension in
   the setting of diarrhea.
   # Hypotension: Was initially fluid responsive, then continued to have
   SBPs in the 70-80s and was started on low dose Levophed. Likely
   secondary to combination of vomiting, diarrhea, and dialysis and
   possibly infection/sepsis.  Pt [**Name (NI) 1016**] POS, though should also consider
   line infection, pneumonia, SBP.  She did have a fever recently and a
   leukocytosis on presentation, so will continue with empiric broad
   coverage antibiotics overnight.
   - attempt to wean off of Levo
   - cautious IV fluids to maintain MAP > 65 and assist weaning pressors
   - f/u blood Cx, stool Cx, PD fluid cell count and Cx
   - Continue IV vanc and flagyl
   - Given age, hypotension requiring pressors, ICU level of care and
   repeat C-diff (i.e failure of therapy) will initiate PO VANC
   # Abdominal pain: Given her hypotension and risk factors for vascular
   disease, would be concerned for bowel ischemia. Also possible SBP or PD
   fluid infection. Prelim read of CT reassuring.
   - monitor serial lactates overnight
   - monitor abdominal exam closely
   - low threshold for CT abdomen
   # Diarrhea: Has persisted over 3 months. Given POS C-diff, likely has
   had chronic infection w/ exacerbations. Will treat as above.
   # Cyanotic fingers:
   Most likely Raynaud's given history.  Has questionnable h/o lupus in
   the past, which would increase chance of Raynaud's.
   - recommend rheum f/u as outpatient
   - OT consult
   - treatment for Raynaud's (calcium channel blockers), which would be
   contraindicated given her current hypotension
   # s/p fall:
   Most likely secondary to dizziness from hypotension.
   - PT consult
   - no evidence of knee injury on exam
   # ESRD on HD and PD:
   Last HD on Monday.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold phos binder given low calcium and phos
   # Coagulopathy:
   On warfarin for h/o SVC syndrome, currently supratherapeutic.  Note
   that she has h/o bleed into gluteal muscle while on heparin IV and that
   RP bleed might explain her abdominal pain and hypotension.
   - type and screen
   - follow coags and Hct overnight
   - no indication for vitamin K or FFP at present
   - hold coumadin for now, restart when back in therapeutic range.
   # HTN:  Holding meds given low BP
   # h/o SVC syndrome:
   - elevated INR at present
   - monitor coags and exam
   # Right hip pain and left shoulder pain:  Chronic
   - tylenol 1000 TID
   - oxycodone for breakthrough pain
   # Left renal cyst:
   Identified during hospital stay in [**7-/2128**], MRI recommended for further
   follow-up.
   - discussed with patient's nephrologist; he is aware of need for MRI
   # Asthma:  albuterol PRN
   # Anemia: baseline hct 25-31, current Hct 30
   Most likely due to ESRD, but reportedly also has h/o iron deficiency
   anemia.
   - follow Hct as discussed above
   - pt signed blood consent
   # OSA: continue CPAP
   # Depression and anxiety:
   - continue home celexa and ativan.
   # FEN:  hold phos binder for now given low Ca and Phos

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with ESRD and a history of C. difficile (C-diff) infection, who was admitted to the MICU with hypotension and diarrhea. The patient has been experiencing persistent diarrhea for three months, and the C-diff infection has not responded to treatment.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, and blood pressure of 81/53 mmHg. She is receiving norepinephrine infusion for persistent hypotension and has a nasogastric tube in place.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, neutrophilia, and a low platelet count. Her lactate levels are elevated, and she has a history of coagulopathy. She is also on warfarin for a history of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome.

The patient's abdominal pain is likely related to C-diff infection, bowel ischemia, or peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluid infection. She is being treated with empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being monitored for signs of sepsis.

The patient's cyanotic fingers are likely related to Raynaud's phenomenon, and she is being referred for rheumatology follow-up. She has a history of possible lupus, which may increase her risk of developing Raynaud's.

The patient's coagulopathy is being monitored, and she is being treated with vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) as needed. Her INR is elevated, and she is being monitored for signs of bleeding.

The patient's medical history includes ESRD, hypertension, and a history of SVC syndrome. She is being treated with warfarin and is being monitored for signs of bleeding.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and history of coagulopathy increase her risk of developing sepsis.
2. Bowel ischemia: The patient's abdominal pain and diarrhea may be related to bowel ischemia, which can lead to necrosis and perforation.
3. Peritoneal dialysis fluid infection: The patient's PD catheter and history of C-diff infection increase her risk of developing peritoneal dialysis fluid infection.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and history of coagulopathy increase her risk of bleeding.
5. Raynaud's phenomenon: The patient's cyanotic fingers and history of possible lupus increase her risk of developing Raynaud's phenomenon.
6. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension and history of coagulopathy increase her risk of developing hypotension.

In summary, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with ESRD and a history of C-diff infection, who is being treated for hypotension, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. She has a history of coagulopathy and is at risk for developing sepsis, bowel ischemia, peritoneal dialysis fluid infection, coagulopathy, Raynaud's phenomenon, and hypotension."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  55yo woman with ESRD and h/o C diff admitted with hypotension in
   the setting of diarrhea.
   # Cyanotic fingers:
   Most likely Raynaud's given history.  Has questionnable h/o lupus in
   the past, which would increase chance of Raynaud's.
   - recommend rheum f/u as outpatient
   - OT consult
   - treatment for Raynaud's (calcium channel blockers)
   # Hypotension:
   Has been fluid responsive.  Suspect this is secondary to combination of
   vomiting, diarrhea, and dialysis.  Most likely source is C diff, but
   would also consider line infection, pneumonia, SBP.  She did have a
   fever recently and a leukocytosis on presentation, so will continue
   with empiric broad coverage antibiotics overnight.
   - IV fluids to maintain MAP > 60
   - blood Cx, stool Cx, C diff, PA/lat CXR, cell count and Cx on
   peritoneal fluid
   - broad spectrum Abx with zosyn/vanc for now and flagyl for possible C
   diff.
   # Abdominal pain:
   Given her hypotension and risk factors for vascular disease, would be
   concerned for bowel ischemia.
   - monitor serial lactates overnight
   - monitor abdominal exam closely
   - low threshold for CT abdomen
   # Diarrhea:
   Has persisted over 3 months.  Will pursue infectious work-up for now,
   but if that is negative, she made need stool studies and GI consult.
   # s/p fall:
   Most likely secondary to dizziness from hypotension.
   - PT consult
   - no evidence of knee injury on exam
   # ESRD on HD and PD:
   Last HD on Monday.
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold phos binder given low calcium and phos
   # Coagulopathy:
   On warfarin for h/o SVC syndrome, currently supratherapeutic.  Note
   that she has h/o bleed into gluteal muscle while on heparin IV and that
   RP bleed might explain her abdominal pain and hypotension.
   - type and screen
   - follow coags and Hct overnight
   - no indication for vitamin K or FFP at present
   # HTN:  Holding meds given low BP
   # h/o SVC syndrome:
   - elevated INR at present
   - monitor coags and exam
   # Right hip pain and left shoulder pain:  Chronic
   - tylenol 1000 TID
   - oxycodone for breakthrough pain
   # Left renal cyst:
   Identified during hospital stay in [**7-/2128**], MRI recommended for further
   follow-up.
   - discussed with patient's nephrologist; he is aware of need for MRI
   # Asthma:  albuterol PRN
   # Anemia: baseline hct 25-31, current Hct 30
   Most likely due to ESRD, but reportedly also has h/o iron deficiency
   anemia.
   - follow Hct as discussed above
   - pt signed blood consent
   # OSA: continue CPAP
   # Depression and anxiety:
   - continue home celexa and ativan.
   # FEN:  hold phos binder for now given low Ca and Phos
   # PPx: on warfarin; famotidine while in ICU
   # Access:  Left femoral placed in ED [**8-25**], right subclavian HD
   catheter, left PIV.
   # Code:  confirmed FULL

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a history of Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection, who was admitted to the MICU with hypotension and diarrhea. The patient has been treated with Levophed for persistent hypotension and has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.5°F)
* Heart rate: 67 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 81/53 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 inspirations per minute (ins/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Abdominal tenderness, particularly in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), without rebound or peritoneal signs
* External hemorrhoids, no mass in the rectal vault, and small amount of liquid brown stool
* Cyanotic fingers, likely due to Raynaud's phenomenon
* Trace left-sided edema and bilateral pedal pulses

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 11.7 K/μL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.3 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 415 K/μL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 29 mg/dL
* Creatinine (Cr): 8.1 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 6.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 2.6 mg/dL

The patient's diagnosis is:

* C. diff infection
* Hypotension
* Abdominal pain
* Diarrhea
* Raynaud's phenomenon
* ESRD on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis
* Coagulopathy
* History of SVC syndrome
* Chronic right hip and left shoulder pain
* Left renal cyst
* Anemia
* Asthma
* Depression and anxiety

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis
* Organ failure (renal, respiratory, or cardiovascular)
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Intestinal perforation
* Septic shock
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Pulmonary edema
* Respiratory failure
* Anemia-related complications (e.g., fatigue, shortness of breath)
* Depression and anxiety-related complications (e.g., decreased quality of life, increased risk of hospital-acquired infections)

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics for C. diff infection
* IV fluids to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mmHg
* Monitoring of serial lactates and abdominal exam
* Low threshold for CT abdomen
* Infectious work-up for diarrhea
* Stool studies and GI consult if infectious work-up is negative
* Phos binder hold due to low calcium and phosphate levels
* Warfarin therapy for SVC syndrome
* Vitamin K and FFP hold due to supratherapeutic INR
* Tylenol and oxycodone for breakthrough pain
* Albuterol PRN for asthma
* CPAP for OSA
* Home celexa and ativan for depression and anxiety
* FEN hold due to low calcium and phosphate levels
* Famotidine while in ICU
* Monitoring of coags and Hct overnight
* Type and screen for blood transfusion
* Follow-up with nephrologist for left renal cyst and MRI recommendations"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient, a 55-year-old with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), presents with hypotension and abdominal pain. The patient has a history of chronic anemia and has been diagnosed with Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.5°F)
* Heart rate: 78 bpm
* Blood pressure: 100/52 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Norepinephrine infusion at 0.08 mcg/kg/min

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Abdominal tenderness in the right lower quadrant (RLQ)
* Decreased bowel sounds at the right base
* No edema or finger cyanosis

The patient's laboratory results are:

* White blood cell count: 11.0-11.7 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 10.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 369-415 K/μL
* Creatinine: 8.1-8.2 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Calcium: 6.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.6 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan are as follows:

1. Shock, hypovolemic or hemorrhagic: The patient is fluid responsive, but required low-dose levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60. The plan is to wean the levophed and trend lactate levels.
2. C. diff: The patient is receiving IV Flagyl and oral Vancomycin, and a final read of the abdominal CT is pending. The plan is to rule out PD infection and follow up with a cell count and blood culture.
3. ESRD: The patient's PD will be resumed today.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coumadin has been held, and no signs of active bleeding are present. The plan is to trend the international normalized ratio (INR) and provide IV vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for active bleeding.
5. Remaining issues: The patient's remaining issues will be addressed as per the housestaff notes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to C. diff infection
* Hemorrhagic shock due to coagulopathy
* Respiratory failure due to hypotension and fluid overload
* Cardiac arrest due to hypotension and electrolyte imbalance
* Renal failure exacerbation due to hypotension and fluid overload
* GI bleeding due to C. diff infection and coagulopathy
* Infection due to PD catheter or dialysis access"

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 66-year-old individual with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis who presents with hypotension and abdominal pain. The patient has a history of chronic anemia and has been experiencing diarrhea. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/52 mmHg.

The patient has been receiving low-dose levophed and has been started on norepinephrine infusion. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, chronic kidney disease, and electrolyte imbalance. The patient's abdominal CT scan is normal, but the patient has a positive C. difficile culture from the femoral line.

The patient's physical examination reveals soft, mild tenderness to deep palpation in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) of the abdomen. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 98% on nasal cannula oxygen.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Hypovolemic shock due to fluid loss and electrolyte imbalance.
2. Infection and sepsis due to C. difficile colonization and potential bacteremia.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening of chronic kidney disease due to hypotension and electrolyte imbalance.
4. Abdominal compartment syndrome or bowel ischemia due to hypotension and decreased perfusion.
5. Anemia and bleeding due to chronic kidney disease and potential gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Superior vena cava syndrome (SVC) due to potential catheter-related complications.

It is essential to continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination to ensure prompt recognition and management of any potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presents to the ICU with hypotension and abdominal pain. She has a history of chronic diarrhea and has recently been diagnosed with Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection. She has been receiving hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis (PD) and has been experiencing severe diarrhea. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she requires low-dose norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, chronic kidney disease, and elevated lactate levels. She has a history of superior vena cava syndrome (SVC) and is being treated with anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's physical examination is notable for mild tenderness in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) of the abdomen and decreased bowel sounds at the right base of the chest.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Hypotension: The patient will be weaned off norepinephrine and trend lactate levels. The source of the hypotension will be investigated, including the possibility of dehydration, PD infection, or other infectious sources.
2. C. diff: The patient will be treated with IV Flagyl and po Vancomycin. The patient's abdominal examination will be followed, and a final read of the abdominal CT will be obtained.
3. ESRD: The patient will resume PD today.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coumadin will be held, and her HCT will be trended. IV vitamin K and FFP will be administered for active bleeding.
5. Remaining issues: The patient's remaining issues will be addressed as per the housestaff notes.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Septic shock due to C. diff infection or other infectious sources.
2. Hemorrhagic complications due to coagulopathy or anticoagulation therapy.
3. Respiratory failure due to hypotension or other underlying medical conditions.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure due to hypotension or other underlying medical conditions.
5. Renal failure or worsening of ESRD due to inadequate dialysis or other underlying medical conditions.
6. Malnutrition or inadequate caloric intake due to diarrhea or other underlying medical conditions.
7. Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression or other underlying medical conditions.
8. Superior vena cava syndrome (SVC) due to compression or obstruction of the SVC."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presents with hypotension, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The patient has been on hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) and has a history of C. difficile (C diff) infection.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.5°F)
* Heart rate: 78 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 100/52 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Abdominal tenderness to deep palpation in the right lower quadrant (RLQ)
* Decreased bowel sounds at the right base
* No edema or finger cyanosis

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.3 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 11.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: 415 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 84 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 8.1 mg/dL
* Calcium: 6.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.6 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Shock, possibly hypovolemic or hemorrhagic
* Abdominal pain, possibly related to C diff infection
* Diarrhea, possibly related to C diff infection
* End-stage renal disease (ESRD)
* Anemia, chronic
* History of superior vena cava syndrome (SVC)

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing PD and HD
* IV Flagyl for C diff infection
* Surgical consult if the patient deteriorates
* Holding coumadin due to coagulopathy
* Trending lactate levels to monitor for infectious sources
* Weaning levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further deterioration of the patient's shock, leading to cardiovascular instability
* Development of sepsis or septic shock due to ongoing C diff infection
* Hemorrhagic complications due to coagulopathy
* worsening of anemia and chronic kidney disease
* Development of electrolyte imbalances due to ongoing diarrhea and vomiting
* Progression of abdominal pain and tenderness, potentially requiring surgical intervention"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  55yo woman with ESRD and h/o C diff admitted with hypotension in
   the setting of diarrhea.
   # Hypotension: Levophed decreased from 0.06 to 0.04mcg/kg/min with MAP
   maintaining >65 since. Initial low BP likely secondary to combination
   of vomiting, diarrhea, and dialysis and possibly infection/sepsis.  Pt
   [**Name (NI) 1016**] POS, though should also consider line infection, pneumonia,
   SBP.  Afebrile ON.
   - continue to wean off of Levo
   - cautious IV fluids to maintain MAP > 65 and assist weaning pressors
   - f/u blood Cx, stool Cx, PD fluid cell count and Cx
   - Continue IV vanc and flagyl
   - Given age, hypotension requiring pressors, ICU level of care and
   repeat C-diff (i.e failure of therapy) will initiate PO VANC
   # Abdominal pain: Given her hypotension and risk factors for vascular
   disease, would be concerned for bowel ischemia, CT negative for
   mesenteric ischemia. Also possible SBP or PD fluid infection.
   - monitor serial lactates overnight
   - monitor abdominal exam closely
   # Diarrhea: Has persisted over 3 months. Given POS C-diff, likely has
   had chronic infection w/ exacerbations. Will treat as above.  2
   episodes last night.
   # Cyanotic fingers:
   Most likely Raynaud's given history.  Has questionnable h/o lupus in
   the past, which would increase chance of Raynaud's.
   - recommend rheum f/u as outpatient
   - OT consult
   - treatment for Raynaud's (calcium channel blockers), which would be
   contraindicated given her current hypotension
   # s/p fall:
   Most likely secondary to dizziness from hypotension.
   - PT consult
   - no evidence of knee injury on exam
   # ESRD on HD and PD:
   Last HD on Monday.
   -Possible HD today
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold phos binder given low calcium and phos
   # Coagulopathy:
   On warfarin for h/o SVC syndrome, currently supratherapeutic at.  Note
   that she has h/o bleed into gluteal muscle while on heparin IV and that
   RP bleed might explain her abdominal pain and hypotension.
   - type and screen
   - follow coags and Hct overnight
   - no indication for vitamin K or FFP at present
   - hold coumadin for now, restart when back in therapeutic range.
   # HTN:  Holding meds given low BP
   # h/o SVC syndrome:
   - elevated INR at present
   - monitor coags and exam
   # Right hip pain and left shoulder pain:  Chronic; Right hip pain
   related to prior hematoma, resolving,
   - tylenol 1000 TID
   - oxycodone for breakthrough pain
   # Left renal cyst:
   Identified during hospital stay in [**7-/2128**], MRI recommended for further
   follow-up.
   - discussed with patient's nephrologist; he is aware of need for MRI
   # Asthma:  albuterol PRN
   # Anemia: baseline hct 25-31, current Hct 30
   Most likely due to ESRD, but reportedly also has h/o iron deficiency
   anemia.
   - follow Hct as discussed above
   - pt signed blood consent
   # OSA: continue CPAP
   # Depression and anxiety:
   - continue home celexa and ativan.
   # FEN:  hold phos binder for now given low Ca and Phos
   # PPx: on warfarin; famotidine while in ICU
   # Access:  Left femoral placed in ED [**8-25**], right subclavian HD
   catheter, left PIV.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health status and potential medical complications:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is a 55-year-old woman with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and a history of Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection, who was admitted with hypotension and diarrhea.
* Her blood pressure has stabilized at >65 mmHg with the reduction of Levo's dosage from 0.06 to 0.04 mcg/kg/min.
* She has persistent abdominal pain, diarrhea, and cyanotic fingers, which may be related to bowel ischemia, small bowel obstruction, or PD fluid infection.
* Her hemoglobin level is 10.3 g/dL, which is slightly low, but her hematocrit is 31.3%, which is within the normal range.
* She has a history of anemia, which may be related to ESRD or iron deficiency anemia.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Bowel ischemia or perforation due to hypotension and risk factors for vascular disease.
* Small bowel obstruction or PD fluid infection, which may exacerbate her abdominal pain and diarrhea.
* C. diff infection, which may persist despite treatment.
* Raynaud's phenomenon, which may be related to her history of lupus and may require treatment with calcium channel blockers.
* Coagulopathy due to supratherapeutic INR, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
* Vitamin K deficiency or FFP may be required to correct the coagulopathy.
* Hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia due to chronic kidney disease and ESRD, which may require treatment with calcium and phosphorus supplements.
* Fall risk due to hypotension and dizziness, which may require PT consult and further evaluation.
* Chronic kidney disease and ESRD, which may require ongoing management with dialysis and medication.
* History of SVC syndrome, which may require ongoing monitoring of coagulation studies and exam.

**Plan:**

* Continue to wean off Levo and maintain MAP > 65 mmHg.
* Monitor serial lactates overnight and abdominal exam closely.
* Treat C. diff infection as above.
* Monitor coagulation studies and exam for signs of bleeding or coagulopathy.
* Hold phosphorus binder given low calcium and phosphorus levels.
* Consider MRI for further evaluation of left renal cyst.
* Continue home medications for depression and anxiety.
* Monitor for signs of worsening kidney function or electrolyte imbalances.
* Anticipate transfer to the floor if hemodynamically stable in the morning."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  55yo woman with ESRD and h/o C diff admitted with hypotension in
   the setting of diarrhea.
   # Hypotension: Levophed d/c
ed with MAP maintaining >65. Initial low BP
   likely secondary to combination of vomiting, diarrhea, and dialysis and
   possibly infection/sepsis.  Pt [**Name (NI) 1016**] POS, though should also consider
   line infection, pneumonia, SBP.  Afebrile ON.
   - cautious IV fluids to maintain MAP > 65
   - f/u blood Cx, stool Cx, PD fluid cell count and Cx
   - Continue Vanco 125mg PO q6hr and Flagyl 500mg IV q8
   # Abdominal pain: Given her hypotension and risk factors for vascular
   disease, concerned for bowel ischemia, CT negative for mesenteric
   ischemia. Also possible SBP or PD fluid infection. Lactate WNL yest.
   - follow cultures.
   - monitor abdominal exam closely
   # Diarrhea: Has persisted over 3 months. Given POS C-diff, likely has
   had chronic infection w/ exacerbations. 2 episodes last night.
   - Will treat as above.
   # Cyanotic fingers:
   Most likely Raynaud's given history.  Has questionnable h/o lupus in
   the past, which would increase chance of Raynaud's. Appreciate OT c/s
   with recs to f/u with outpt rheum
   - recommend rheum f/u as outpatient
   - treatment for Raynaud's (calcium channel blockers), which would be
   contraindicated given her current hypotension
   # s/p fall:
   Most likely secondary to dizziness from hypotension.
   - PT consult pending
   - no evidence of knee injury on exam
   # ESRD on HD and PD:
   Last HD on Monday.
   -Possible HD today per Renal
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold phos binder given low calcium and phos
   # Coagulopathy:
   On warfarin for h/o SVC syndrome, currently supratherapeutic at 5.0.
   h/o bleed into gluteal muscle while on heparin IV
   - follow coags and Hct overnight
   - no indication for vitamin K or FFP at present
   - hold coumadin for now, restart when back in therapeutic range.
   # HTN:  Holding meds given low BP
   # h/o SVC syndrome:
   - elevated INR at present
   - monitor coags and exam
   # Right hip pain and left shoulder pain:  Chronic; Right hip pain
   related to prior hematoma, continuing pain
   - tylenol 1000 TID
   - oxycodone for breakthrough pain
   # Left renal cyst:
   Identified during hospital stay in [**7-/2128**], MRI recommended for further
   follow-up.
   - discussed with patient's nephrologist; he is aware of need for MRI
   # Asthma:  albuterol PRN
   # Anemia: baseline hct 25-31, current Hct 31.8
   Most likely due to ESRD, but reportedly also has h/o iron deficiency
   anemia.
   - follow Hct as discussed above
   - pt signed blood consent
   # OSA: continue CPAP
   # Depression and anxiety:
   - continue home celexa and ativan.
   # FEN:  hold phos binder for now given low Ca and Phos
   # PPx: holding warfarin; supratherapeutic INR; famotidine while in ICU
   # Access:  Left femoral placed in ED [**8-25**] (if pt

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and a history of Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection, admitted with hypotension and diarrhea. The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain, diarrhea, and has a history of chronic kidney disease.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 121/64 mmHg, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with no oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.0-11.7 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 30.0-31.4%
* Platelet count: 369-415 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 8.2-8.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 235-102 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: within normal range
* Glucose: 114-84 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.0 mg/dL

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still unstable, and the patient may require further treatment to maintain blood pressure within a normal range.
2. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is likely related to bowel ischemia, SBP, or PD fluid infection. The patient's lactate levels are within normal range, but the patient's abdominal exam should be closely monitored.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea has persisted for three months, and the patient may have a chronic C. diff infection. The patient's stool cultures should be followed.
4. Cyanotic fingers: The patient's cyanotic fingers are likely related to Raynaud's phenomenon, which may be exacerbated by the patient's history of lupus.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is supratherapeutic, and the patient may require vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to correct the coagulopathy.
6. Right hip pain and left shoulder pain: The patient's chronic pain may be related to prior hematoma or other underlying conditions.
7. Left renal cyst: The patient's left renal cyst may require further evaluation with MRI.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Cautious IV fluids to maintain blood pressure within a normal range.
2. Follow-up blood cultures, stool cultures, and PD fluid cell count and culture.
3. Continue vancomycin and metronidazole as prescribed.
4. Monitor abdominal exam closely.
5. Follow coagulopathy and Hct overnight.
6. Hold coumadin for now, restart when back in therapeutic range.
7. Hold phos binder for now given low calcium and phosphorus.
8. Continue CPAP and home celexa and ativan as prescribed.
9. Follow Hct as discussed above.
10. Discuss MRI with nephrologist for further evaluation of left renal cyst.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but the patient requires close monitoring and treatment to manage her underlying medical conditions and potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and a history of Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection, admitted with hypotension and diarrhea. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 121/64 mmHg and a heart rate of 90 beats per minute. The patient is receiving norepinephrine infusion at 0.04 mcg/kg/min and has had a run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) at 23:00, which resolved without treatment.

The patient's abdominal pain is ongoing, with diffuse tenderness and increased pain over the site of the percutaneous dialysis (PD) insertion. The patient has had two episodes of diarrhea overnight and is being treated with vancomycin and metronidazole. The patient's lactate level is within normal limits, and there is no evidence of bowel ischemia on computed tomography (CT) scan.

The patient has a history of Raynaud's phenomenon, and her fingers are cyanotic. The patient has also had a fall, which is likely secondary to dizziness from hypotension. The patient's coagulation status is supratherapeutic, and warfarin is being held. The patient has a history of hypertension, which is being managed with medication.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, and a white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated creatinine level of 8.2 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history is significant for ESRD, C. diff infection, hypertension, and a history of SVC syndrome. The patient is also taking medications for depression and anxiety, and has a history of iron deficiency anemia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bowel ischemia: Given the patient's ongoing diarrhea and abdominal pain, there is a risk of bowel ischemia, which could lead to necrosis and perforation.
2. Infection: The patient's history of C. diff infection and ongoing diarrhea increase the risk of infection, particularly in the abdominal cavity.
3. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and elevated white blood cell count increase the risk of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's supratherapeutic INR and history of bleeding while on heparin increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and ongoing treatment with norepinephrine infusion increase the risk of hypertension, which could lead to cardiac complications.
6. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD and ongoing dialysis increase the risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and abdominal exam closely to detect any potential complications early."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  55yo woman with ESRD admitted with hypotension and C diff
   colitis.
   #NSVT: Asymptomatic 30beat run, resolved without treatment, EKG
   suggests SVT with aberrancy, CEx1 neg, TTE showed no evidence of
   ischemia.
   -          Continue to monitor on tele.
   -          Replete lytes
   # Hypotension: Levophed d/c
ed with MAP maintaining >65. Initial low BP
   likely secondary to combination of vomiting, diarrhea, and dialysis and
   possibly infection/sepsis.  Pt [**Name (NI) 1016**] POS.  Afebrile ON.
   - BCx and peritoneal Cx NGTD
   - cautious IV fluids to maintain MAP > 65 (pt is anuric)
   - Continue Vanco 125mg PO q6hr and Flagyl 500mg IV q8
   # Abdominal pain: Given her hypotension and risk factors for vascular
   disease, concerned for bowel ischemia, CT negative for mesenteric
   ischemia. Also possible SBP or PD fluid infection. Lactate WNL yest.
   - follow cultures.
   - monitor abdominal exam closely
   # Diarrhea: Has persisted over 3 months. Given POS C-diff, likely has
   had chronic infection w/ exacerbations. 2 episodes last night.
   - Will treat as above.
   # Cyanotic fingers:
   Most likely Raynaud's given history.  Has questionnable h/o lupus in
   the past, which would increase chance of Raynaud's. Appreciate OT c/s
   with recs to f/u with outpt rheum
   - recommend rheum f/u as outpatient
   - treatment for Raynaud's (calcium channel blockers), which would be
   contraindicated given her current hypotension
   # s/p fall:
   Most likely secondary to dizziness from hypotension.
   - PT consult pending
   - no evidence of knee injury on exam
   # ESRD on HD and PD:
   Last HD on Monday.
   -Possible HD today per Renal
   - appreciate renal recs
   - hold phos binder given low calcium and phos
   # Coagulopathy:
   On warfarin for h/o SVC syndrome, currently supratherapeutic at 5.0.
   h/o bleed into gluteal muscle while on heparin IV
   - follow coags and Hct overnight
   - no indication for vitamin K or FFP at present
   - hold coumadin for now, restart when back in therapeutic range.
   # HTN:  Holding meds given low BP
   # h/o SVC syndrome:
   - elevated INR at present
   - monitor coags and exam
   # Right hip pain and left shoulder pain:  Chronic; Right hip pain
   related to prior hematoma, continuing pain
   - tylenol 1000 TID
   - oxycodone for breakthrough pain
   # Left renal cyst:
   Identified during hospital stay in [**7-/2128**], MRI recommended for further
   follow-up.
   - discussed with patient's nephrologist; he is aware of need for MRI
   # Asthma:  albuterol PRN
   # Anemia: baseline hct 25-31, current Hct 31.8
   Most likely due to ESRD, but reportedly also has h/o iron deficiency
   anemia.
   - follow Hct as discussed above
   - pt signed blood consent
   # OSA: continue CPAP
   # Depression and anxiety:
   - continue home celexa and ativan.
   # FEN:  hold phos binder for now given low Ca and Phos
   # PPx: holding warfarin; supratherapeutic INR; famotidine while in ICU
   # Access:  Left femoral placed in ED [**8-25**] (if pt

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   had chronic infection w/ exacerbations. 2 episodes last night.
   - Will treat as above.
   # Cyanotic fingers:
   Most likely Raynaud's given history.  Has questionnable h/o lupus in
   the past, which would increase chance of Raynaud's. Appreciate OT c/s

   - follow coags and Hct overnight
   - no indication for vitamin K or FFP at present
   - hold coumadin for now, restart when back in therapeutic range.
   # HTN:  Holding meds given low BP
   # h/o SVC syndrome:
   - elevated INR at present
   - monitor coags and exam
   # Right hip pain and left shoulder pain:  Chronic; Right hip pain
   related to prior hematoma, continuing pain

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old woman with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) admitted with hypotension and Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) colitis. She has a history of vascular disease and is at risk for bowel ischemia. She has been experiencing abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting, which may be related to her C. diff infection or bowel ischemia. She has also been experiencing right hip and left shoulder pain, which is chronic and related to a prior hematoma. She has a history of iron deficiency anemia and is currently anemic. She has been prescribed warfarin for a history of Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome and is currently supratherapeutic. She has a history of bleeding into her gluteal muscle while on heparin IV.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bowel ischemia: The patient's history of vascular disease and abdominal pain suggest that she may be at risk for bowel ischemia, which can lead to necrosis and perforation of the bowel.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may be indicative of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death if not treated promptly.
3. Infection: The patient's C. diff infection may not be fully treated, and she may be at risk for developing further infections, such as urinary tract infections or pneumonia.
4. Hemorrhage: The patient's history of bleeding into her gluteal muscle while on heparin IV suggests that she may be at risk for further bleeding, particularly if her INR is not properly managed.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she continues to experience bleeding or if her iron deficiency is not addressed.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if her blood pressure is not properly managed, which can lead to organ failure and death.
7. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain may not be properly managed, which can lead to decreased mobility and increased risk of further complications.
8. Raynaud's phenomenon: The patient's history of Raynaud's phenomenon may worsen if she is not properly treated, which can lead to tissue necrosis and gangrene.
9. Superior Vena Cava syndrome: The patient's history of SVC syndrome may worsen if her INR is not properly managed, which can lead to further bleeding and organ failure.
10. End-stage renal disease: The patient's ESRD may worsen if her kidney function is not properly managed, which can lead to further complications and increased risk of death."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient, a 55-year-old ESRD patient, is currently in the ICU due to hypotension, diarrhea, and C. diff. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/71 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a non-rebreather mask, with an SpO2 of 99%. The patient's physical examination is notable for decreased breath sounds at the right base, soft and mild tenderness to deep palpation over the PD catheter, and no edema or finger cyanosis.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 11.0-11.7 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 31.3-31.8 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 8.2-8.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 29-24 mg/dL
* Sodium: 136-136 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.4-4.2 mmol/L
* Chloride: 99-101 mmol/L
* CO2: 29-24 mmol/L
* Glucose: 114-84 mg/dL
* Calcium: 6.8-6.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1-2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.6-2.5 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Shock, hypovolemic or hemorrhagic
* Abdominal pain (including abdominal tenderness)
* Diarrhea
* Renal failure, end-stage (ESRD)
* History of superior vena cava syndrome (SVC)

The plan is to:

* Wean the patient off levophed and trend lactate
* Check for echo evidence of SVT
* Continue IV Flagyl and PO Vanco for C. diff
* Resume PD and HD
* Monitor for coagulopathy and bleeding
* Trend INR and consider IV Vit and FFP for active bleeding
* Consider low-dose beta blocker for SVT if BPs are stable

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further deterioration of renal function
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy
* Worsening of diarrhea and dehydration
* Increased risk of cardiovascular complications due to SVT and potential need for beta blocker therapy
* Potential for further complications related to ESRD and PD/HD therapy."

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old ESRD patient who presents with hypotension, C. diff, and abdominal pain. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/71 mmHg. The patient is receiving norepinephrine infusion to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, chronic kidney disease, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prolonged INR and PT/PTT.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Shock, hypovolemic or hemorrhagic: The patient is fluid responsive, but required low-dose levophed to maintain a MAP of 60. The patient will be weaned off levophed and trend lactate levels.
2. New SVT: The patient's SVT is stable, and the patient will undergo an echocardiogram to rule out any cardiac issues.
3. C. diff: The patient is receiving IV Flagyl and oral Vancomycin, and the abdominal exam is stable. The patient will undergo a final read of the abdominal CT scan and may require a surgical consult if they deteriorate.
4. ESRD: The patient will resume peritoneal dialysis today.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient is holding Coumadin, and there is no sign of active bleeding. The patient's HCT is stable, and the INR will be trended.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further deterioration of the patient's hypotension, leading to organ failure
* Development of cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's underlying cardiac condition
* Progression of the patient's C. diff infection, leading to sepsis
* Hemorrhagic complications due to the patient's coagulopathy
* Further decline in the patient's renal function, leading to end-stage renal disease

To mitigate these complications, the patient will require close monitoring and management of their blood pressure, cardiac status, and coagulation profile. The patient's C. diff infection will need to be aggressively treated, and the patient's ESRD will require continued management through peritoneal dialysis."
