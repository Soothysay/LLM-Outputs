   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER: The patient has atrial flutter that has been
   difficult to rate control despite multiple agents for the past two days
   at [**Hospital3 **]. At the [**Hospital1 1**] his rate is still tachycardic in the
   110s-120s on diltiazen boluses. Since his tachyarrhythmia has been
   difficult to control on medical therapy, he will need electrical
   cardioversion to reverse his typical atrial flutter. In addition, he
   should have ablation to prevent recurrence of flutter. However, given
   the possibility that his flutter has been going on for the past 2 weeks
   and his CHADS2 score is [**2-23**] (4% risk of stroke), the risk of
   thromboembolism with cardioversion is high. Today he will have a TEE to
   assess for clot in the left atrium, and if there is no clot Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**] will do the cardioversion and ablation. After the procedure he
   will need to continue warfarin (goal INR 2.0-3.0) for at least 4 weeks.
   -          Diltiazem boluses until the procedure for rate control if HR
   is 130-150s, goal HR 80-120
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          TEE to assess for clot
   -          Electrical cardioversion if no clot present with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**]
   -          Ablation to prevent recurrent flutter
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. It is also
   possible that he has chronic CHF secondary to COPD and OSA given his
   history of smoking and body habitus, which may have caused his
   tachyarrhythmia, which then exacerbated his CHF. For further evaluation
   we would need PFTs, sleep studies, and a measurement of his heart
   pressures, but these could be performed as an outpatient. Other
   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's current condition is:

* Atrial flutter with a heart rate of 142 beats per minute (bpm) and an irregular rhythm
* Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy with decreased diastolic filling time and decreased preload
* Congestive heart failure (CHF) with mild fluid overload and pitting edema in his calves
* Wheezing with a history of smoking and possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* Hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus (DMII)
* Hypertension with a history of smoking and body habitus

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 9.4 K/uL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 38.5%
* Platelet count (Plt): 247
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 162 mg/dL
* Potassium: 4.2 mEq/L
* Calcium: 8.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.1 mg/dL
* Albumin: 3.6 g/dL
* Ca++: 8.9 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL
* PO4: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Electrical cardioversion and ablation to reverse atrial flutter and prevent recurrent flutter
* Warfarin therapy for at least 4 weeks to prevent thromboembolism
* Diltiazem boluses for rate control until the procedure
* Heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
* TEE to assess for clot
* Ablation to prevent recurrent flutter
* CHF management with diuresis and lasix
* Wheezing management with bronchodilators and outpatient evaluation
* Coronary artery disease (CAD) risk reduction with aspirin
* DMII management with insulin sliding scale
* Hyperlipidemia management with continued home regimen
* Hypertension management with ACE-I and beta-blocker as tolerated
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Tachyarrhythmia and atrial flutter recurrence
* Thromboembolism with cardioversion
* CHF exacerbation with fluid overload
* COPD exacerbation with wheezing
* CAD risk with high cholesterol and smoking
* DMII complications with high blood sugar
* Hypertension complications with high blood pressure
* Bleeding complications with anticoagulation therapy
* Infection complications with DVT and VAP prophylaxis
* Gastrointestinal complications with stress ulcer prophylaxis"

Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with atrial flutter, acute diastolic heart failure, and a CHADS2 score of 4%. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 142 bpm, blood pressure of 109/71 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving infusions of Heparin Sodium and Diltiazem. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, glucose, and troponin, and decreased levels of albumin and calcium.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's atrial flutter and acute diastolic heart failure increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure may worsen, leading to increased morbidity and mortality.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output increase the risk of acute kidney injury.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tachypnea and decreased oxygen saturation increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and decreased platelet count increase the risk of sepsis.
6. Bleeding Complications: The patient's receiving Heparin Sodium increases the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's elevated glucose levels and receiving insulin increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's elevated potassium and magnesium levels and decreased calcium levels increase the risk of electrolyte imbalance.
9. Infection: The patient's decreased white blood cell count and increased risk of sepsis increase the risk of infection.
10. Multi-Organ Failure: The patient's underlying conditions and laboratory results increase the risk of multi-organ failure."

Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall individual with atrial flutter, acute diastolic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. They have been admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of tachycardia and are currently receiving heparin sodium and diltiazem infusions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 142 bpm and a blood pressure of 109/71 mmHg. They are receiving nasal cannula oxygen therapy and have a SpO2 of 92%. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, and laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, anemia, and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's acute diastolic heart failure may worsen due to the underlying condition or complications such as arrhythmias or electrolyte imbalances.
2. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), due to their atrial flutter and chronic kidney disease.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to their respiratory support and prolonged ICU stay.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's laboratory results show hyperglycemia, which may lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyperkalemia, if not managed properly.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen due to the underlying condition or complications such as acute kidney injury (AKI) or nephrotoxicity from medications.
6. Arrhythmias: The patient's atrial flutter may worsen or convert to more complex arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, if not managed properly.
7. Pulmonary edema: The patient's acute diastolic heart failure may lead to pulmonary edema, which may worsen respiratory status and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and lack of oral intake may lead to malnutrition, which may worsen overall health and increase the risk of complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER: The patient has atrial flutter that has been
   difficult to rate control despite multiple agents for the past two days
   at [**Hospital3 **]. At the [**Hospital1 1**] his rate is still tachycardic in the
   110s-120s on diltiazen boluses. Since his tachyarrhythmia has been
   difficult to control on medical therapy, he will need electrical
   cardioversion to reverse his typical atrial flutter. In addition, he
   should have ablation to prevent recurrence of flutter. However, given
   the possibility that his flutter has been going on for the past 2 weeks
   and his CHADS2 score is [**2-23**] (4% risk of stroke), the risk of
   thromboembolism with cardioversion is high. Today he will have a TEE to
   assess for clot in the left atrium, and if there is no clot Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**] will do the cardioversion and ablation. After the procedure he
   will need to continue warfarin (goal INR 2.0-3.0) for at least 4 weeks.
   -          Diltiazem boluses until the procedure for rate control if HR
   is 130-150s, goal HR 80-120
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          TEE to assess for clot
   -          Electrical cardioversion if no clot present with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**]
   -          Ablation to prevent recurrent flutter
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. It is also
   possible that he has chronic CHF secondary to COPD and OSA given his
   history of smoking and body habitus, which may have caused his
   tachyarrhythmia, which then exacerbated his CHF. For further evaluation
   we would need PFTs, sleep studies, and a measurement of his heart
   pressures, but these could be performed as an outpatient. Other
   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.
   ..
   # FEN: NPO for TEE, cardiac diet afterwards
   # ACCESS: PIV's x2 18s
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -          DVT ppx: covered with heparin which we are using for his
   Coumadin bridge
   -          Bowel regimen with senna/colace

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER: The patient has atrial flutter that has been
   difficult to rate control despite multiple agents for the past two days
   at [**Hospital3 **]. At the [**Hospital1 1**] his rate is still tachycardic in the
   110s-120s on diltiazen boluses. Since his tachyarrhythmia has been
   difficult to control on medical therapy, he will need electrical
   cardioversion to reverse his typical atrial flutter. In addition, he
   should have ablation to prevent recurrence of flutter. However, given
   the possibility that his flutter has been going on for the past 2 weeks
   and his CHADS2 score is [**2-23**] (4% risk of stroke), the risk of
   thromboembolism with cardioversion is high. Today he will have a TEE to
   assess for clot in the left atrium, and if there is no clot Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**] will do the cardioversion and ablation. After the procedure he
   will need to continue warfarin (goal INR 2.0-3.0) for at least 4 weeks.
   -          Diltiazem boluses until the procedure for rate control if HR
   is 130-150s, goal HR 80-120
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          TEE to assess for clot
   -          Electrical cardioversion if no clot present with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**]
   -          Ablation to prevent recurrent flutter
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. It is also
   possible that he has chronic CHF secondary to COPD and OSA given his
   history of smoking and body habitus, which may have caused his
   tachyarrhythmia, which then exacerbated his CHF. For further evaluation
   we would need PFTs, sleep studies, and a measurement of his heart
   pressures, but these could be performed as an outpatient. Other
   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and atrial flutter. He was transferred from another hospital for further management of atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion. The patient has been experiencing tachycardia, with a heart rate ranging from 110s to 120s, despite receiving diltiazem boluses. His atrial flutter has been difficult to rate control, and he is at high risk of thromboembolism with cardioversion.

The patient has also been experiencing congestive heart failure (CHF), likely due to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. He has been mildly fluid overloaded, with pitting edema in his calves. His cardiac output is decreased, and he is at risk of worsening CHF if his tachycardia is not controlled.

The patient has a history of smoking, which puts him at risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was started on multiple medications at the outside hospital, but specific treatment for his wheezing is better suited for the outpatient environment.

The patient has no evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) on EKG, but his Framingham risk score indicates a 20% risk of myocardial infarction in the next 10 years. He should be on a baby aspirin.

The patient has a history of DM, with high sugars on admission. He is currently on an insulin sliding scale.

The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, and his home regimen should be continued.

The patient has a history of HTN, and his home blood pressure medications are being held due to concerns about lisinopril affecting his hemodynamics.

The patient is currently NPO for a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and will be on a cardiac diet afterwards.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening CHF: If the patient's tachycardia is not controlled, his cardiac output may decrease further, leading to worsening CHF.
2. Thromboembolism: The patient is at high risk of thromboembolism with cardioversion, which could lead to stroke or pulmonary embolism.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of smoking and COPD puts him at risk for respiratory failure, particularly if his wheezing is not adequately managed.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to his diabetes and CHF makes him more susceptible to infection.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial flutter and history of CHF increase his risk of developing other cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, I recommend that he undergo electrical cardioversion and ablation to control his atrial flutter and improve his cardiac output. He should also be managed with diltiazem for rate control and warfarin for thromboembolic prevention. His CHF should be managed with diuresis and fluid restriction, and he should be monitored for signs of worsening CHF."

   1.       We did not restart any of his rate/rhythm medications.
   However, we may use IV diltiazem if necessary tonight.
   2.       We did not restart any of his COPD meds because of the risk
   that they may increase his heart rate and even exacerbate the flutter.
   If he develops respiratory distress overnight that is related to
   wheezing, we may consider ipratropium.
   3.       [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20%, so ASA for primary prevention is
   a good idea to decrease risk of MI in the next 10 years.
   4.       K is 5.2, but right now we can see how he does in the morning.
   CHADS2 is [**2-23**], wish is 4%.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER: The patient has atrial flutter that has been
   difficult to rate control despite multiple agents for the past two days
   at [**Hospital3 **]. At the [**Hospital1 1**] his rate is still tachycardic in the
   110s-120s on diltiazen boluses. Since his tachyarrhythmia has been
   difficult to control on medical therapy, he will need electrical
   cardioversion to reverse his typical atrial flutter. In addition, he
   should have ablation to prevent recurrence of flutter. However, given
   the possibility that his flutter has been going on for the past 2 weeks
   and his CHADS2 score is [**2-23**] (4% risk of stroke), the risk of
   thromboembolism with cardioversion is high. Today he will have a TEE to
   assess for clot in the left atrium, and if there is no clot Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**] will do the cardioversion and ablation. After the procedure he
   will need to continue warfarin (goal INR 2.0-3.0) for at least 4 weeks.
   -          Diltiazem boluses until the procedure for rate control if HR
   is 130-150s, goal HR 80-120
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          TEE to assess for clot
   -          Electrical cardioversion if no clot present with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**]
   -          Ablation to prevent recurrent flutter
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. Other etiologies,
   such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less likely
   given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse. Either
   way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess if his
   cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely improved
   after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has diuresed
   about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid overloaded
   as evidenced by moderate pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   overnight should be even to slightly (500 cc) negative, but there is no
   need at this time to aggressively diuresed as his fluid overload should
   get better after tomorrow
s procedure. Rate control should be enough
   for him for now to control his symptoms.
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   -          I/O goal net even to slightly (500 cc) negative
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation tomorrow should
   improve his LV function
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG. He is on an
   aspirin for unclear reason. We will hold the ASA for now.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.
   ..
   # FEN: cardiac diet, NPO for TEE after midnight
   # ACCESS: PIV's x2 18s
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -          DVT ppx with heparin gtt
   -          Bowel regimen with senna/colace
   # CODE: full
   # DISPO: CCU for now
   # CONTACT: wife: [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6069**]
   1.       We did not restart any of his rate/rhythm medications.
   However, we may use IV diltiazem if necessary tonight.
   2.       We did not restart any of his COPD meds because of the risk
   that they may increase his heart rate and even exacerbate the flutter.
   If he develops respiratory distress overnight that is related to
   wheezing, we may consider ipratropium.
   3.       [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20%, so ASA for primary prevention is
   a good idea to decrease risk of MI in the next 10 years.
   4.       K is 5.2, but right now we can see how he does in the morning.
   CHADS2 is [**2-23**], wish is 4%.

Summary:

The patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and atrial flutter. He was transferred to the ICU for further management of his atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion. The patient has been tachycardic overnight, with a heart rate of 142 bpm, and has been given diltiazem 5 mg IV twice to control his heart rate. He is also experiencing wheezing, which is likely related to his history of smoking and COPD.

The patient has been diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF) due to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, and his cardiac function is expected to improve after electrical cardioversion and ablation. He is also at risk for thromboembolism due to his CHADS2 score of 2, which indicates a 4% risk of stroke.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Thromboembolism: The patient's high CHADS2 score indicates a high risk of thromboembolism, which can lead to stroke, pulmonary embolism, or deep vein thrombosis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's wheezing and COPD make him at risk for respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by his tachycardia and atrial flutter.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial flutter is difficult to control, and he may experience cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and history of smoking make him at risk for infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes and use of insulin sliding scale make him at risk for hypoglycemia, particularly if his glucose levels are not closely monitored.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's use of diuretics and insulin sliding scale may lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.
7. Renal failure: The patient's history of hypertension and CHF make him at risk for renal failure, particularly if his blood pressure is not well-controlled.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 72-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with atrial flutter and acute diastolic heart failure. They underwent successful ablation and are currently in normal sinus rhythm. They were restarted on lisinopril and lopressor overnight and diuresed well. Their blood pressure was slightly high overnight, but vital signs remain stable. The patient is requesting discharge before a housewarming party tomorrow at noon.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Heart failure progression: The patient's diastolic heart failure may worsen, leading to increased congestion and decreased cardiac output.
2. Arrhythmia recurrence: The successful ablation does not guarantee that atrial flutter will not recur, and the patient may require further interventions.
3. Blood pressure management: The patient's blood pressure was slightly high overnight, which may indicate a need for further antihypertensive medication adjustments.
4. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids, which may lead to fluid overload and compromise cardiac function.
5. Infection risk: The patient is at risk for developing infections, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to their prolonged ICU stay.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to their inability to eat and the need for IV fluids and medications.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's use of furosemide (Lasix) may lead to gastrointestinal side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
8. Renal function decline: The patient's kidney function may decline due to the use of diuretics and other medications, which may require adjustments to their medication regimen.
9. Hypocalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are slightly low, which may require supplementation to prevent complications.
10. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus, may require monitoring and adjustments to prevent complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER. The patient underwent successful ablation yesterday.
   We restarted his beta-blocker for rate control and he has since had
   rates mostly in the 80s-90s and has maintained NSR.  Because he
   underwent ablation yesterday, he will need to be anti-coagulated for at
   least one month due to the risk of thromboembolic disease. His INR this
   morning is 1.9, so he should continue the heparin bridge until INR goal
   of 2.0-3.0 is reached. Checking a PM INR would be useful, as we could
   probably d/c the heparin in the afternoon. He otherwise is continuing
   warfarin 5 mg po qd. In the long term, he will probably need warfarin
   even after the one-month post-ablation period, because his CHADS2 score
   is [**3-23**], which puts him at about 6% risk for thromboembolic disease
   without anti-coagulation.
   -          Metoprolol for rate control
   -          HR goals: 80s-90s
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0 for at least one
   month, possibly in the long-term as well due to CHADS2 score
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   # CHF: Yesterday he was net negative over 2.5 L with lasix boluses. He
   has improved clinically in terms of his fluid overload, now with
   minimal pitting edema in the lower extremities and no crackles at the
   lung bases, with a CVP of 6. As over this morning he diuresed 1.2L. He
   could probably benefit from a little more diuresis, but very no more
   than 2.5L for the day. Another bolus of 20 cc IV lasix could be
   helpful. In terms of long-term medications, we restarted him on
   lisinopril 5 mg po qd and metoprolol 25 mg po bid. Since his HR is
   relatively well controlled, but his BP has been slightly high in the
   SBP 130s, we could go up on his lisinopril to 10 mg po qd. More
   complete management is better suited in the outpatient setting.
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. It is also
   possible that he has chronic CHF secondary to COPD and OSA given his
   history of smoking and body habitus, which may have caused his
   tachyarrhythmia, which then exacerbated his CHF. For further evaluation
   we would need PFTs, sleep studies, and a measurement of his heart
   pressures, but these could be performed as an outpatient. Other
   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.
   ..
   # FEN: NPO for TEE, cardiac diet afterwards
   # ACCESS: PIV's x2 18s
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -          DVT ppx: covered with heparin which we are using for his
   Coumadin bridge
   -          Bowel regimen with senna/colace

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and atrial flutter. He underwent successful ablation yesterday and is currently in sinus rhythm with a heart rate mostly in the 80s-90s. 

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Thromboembolic disease: The patient is at risk for thromboembolic disease due to his atrial flutter and CHADS2 score of 3. He will need to be anti-coagulated with warfarin for at least one month, and possibly in the long-term.

2. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy may worsen his CHF symptoms. He needs to be monitored for signs of fluid overload and may require diuresis and medications to manage his heart failure.

3. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of smoking and COPD puts him at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure. He should be closely monitored for signs of respiratory distress.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes and high blood sugars on admission put him at risk for hyperglycemia. He should be closely monitored for signs of hyperglycemia and may require insulin sliding scale therapy.

5. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and high blood pressure overnight put him at risk for hypertension-related complications. He should be closely monitored for signs of hypertension and may require adjustments to his blood pressure medications.

6. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for DVT due to his atrial flutter and immobility. He should receive DVT prophylaxis with heparin and be closely monitored for signs of DVT.

7. VAP prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for VAP due to his intubation and immobility. He should receive VAP prophylaxis with stress ulcer prophylaxis and be closely monitored for signs of VAP.

8. Infection prophylaxis: The patient should receive infection prophylaxis with bowel regimen and senna/colace to prevent constipation.

9. Coronary artery disease: Although the patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, he should be on a baby aspirin due to his high risk score for MI in the next 10 years.

10. Hyperlipidemia: The patient should continue his home regimen for hyperlipidemia.

In conclusion, the patient has several potential medical complications that can arise, and he should be closely monitored for signs of these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER. The patient underwent successful ablation yesterday.
   We restarted his beta-blocker for rate control and he has since had
   rates mostly in the 80s-90s and has maintained NSR.  Because he
   underwent ablation yesterday, he will need to be anti-coagulated for at
   least one month due to the risk of thromboembolic disease. His INR this
   morning is 1.9, so he should continue the heparin bridge until INR goal
   of 2.0-3.0 is reached and continue warfarin 5 mg po qd.
   -          Metoprolol for rate control
   -          HR goals: 80s-90s
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0 for at least one
   month
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          appreciate final EP recommendations
   -          f/u 2PM laboratory data
   # CHF: Yesterday he was net negative over 2.5 L with lasix 40 mg iv
   bolus. He has improved clinically in terms of his fluid overload, now
   with mild pitting edema in the lower extremities and no crackles at the
   lung bases, with a CVP of 6. However, his O2 sat has been in the 88-92%
   range, which indicates that he may still have some fluid in his lungs.
   He could benefit from more diuresis, with approximately an additional
   1.5-2.0 L. We
ll give him another bolus of 40 cc IV lasix this AM and
   reassess I/O goals in the afternoon. We hope that his high SBP
   (130-140s) will come down with lasix 40 mg iv bolus, but if it remains
   high he may need to increase lisinopril - more complete management is
   better suited in the outpatient setting. In terms of long-term
   medications, we restarted him on lisinopril 5 mg po qd and metoprolol
   25 mg po bid.
   -          Metoprolol 25 mg po bid
   -          Lisinopril 5 mg po qd
   -          Lasix 40 mg iv bolus
   -          Goal I/O: 1.5-2.0 net negative by PM (for a total of
   2.7-3.2L net negative, because he already diursed 1.2L this AM)
   -          PCP appointment for further follow-up.
   -          f/u ambulatory O2 sat
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   -          Continue O2 3L by nasal canula
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   -          [**Name2 (NI) **]nue ASA 81 mg po qd

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and atrial flutter. He underwent successful ablation yesterday and is currently being treated for atrial flutter, congestive heart failure, wheezing, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the 80s-90s and a blood pressure in the 130-140s. He is receiving oxygen therapy and is being monitored for fluid overload, which is being managed with diuretics. His lung function is compromised, with mild wheezing in the right lower lung field, but he is not experiencing respiratory distress.

The patient's laboratory results show mild elevations in his blood glucose and lipase levels, but his electrolyte levels are within normal limits. His coagulation studies show a prolonged PT and PTT, but his INR is within the therapeutic range.

The patient's medications include heparin, warfarin, metoprolol, lisinopril, furosemide, and insulin. He is also receiving oxygen therapy and is being monitored for fluid overload.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Thromboembolic disease due to atrial flutter and the need for anticoagulation therapy.
2. Fluid overload and congestive heart failure, which could worsen his respiratory status.
3. Respiratory failure due to his compromised lung function and wheezing.
4. Hypoglycemia due to his diabetes and insulin therapy.
5. Hypertension, which could worsen his cardiovascular status.
6. Hyperlipidemia, which could increase his risk of cardiovascular disease.
7. Coronary artery disease, which could increase his risk of myocardial infarction.

The patient's plan of care includes continued anticoagulation therapy, diuretic therapy, and oxygen therapy. He will also require close monitoring for fluid overload and congestive heart failure, as well as regular laboratory tests to monitor his coagulation status and electrolyte levels."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER. The patient underwent successful ablation yesterday.
   We restarted his beta-blocker for rate control and he has since had
   rates mostly in the 80s-90s and has maintained NSR.  Because he
   underwent ablation yesterday, he will need to be anti-coagulated for at
   least one month due to the risk of thromboembolic disease. His INR this
   morning is 1.9, so he should continue the heparin bridge until INR goal
   of 2.0-3.0 is reached. Checking a PM INR would be useful, as we could
   probably d/c the heparin in the afternoon. He otherwise is continuing
   warfarin 5 mg po qd. In the long term, he will probably need warfarin
   even after the one-month post-ablation period, because his CHADS2 score
   is [**3-23**], which puts him at about 6% risk for thromboembolic disease
   without anti-coagulation.
   -          Metoprolol for rate control
   -          HR goals: 80s-90s
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0 for at least one
   month, possibly in the long-term as well due to CHADS2 score
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   # CHF: Yesterday he was net negative over 2.5 L with lasix boluses. He
   has improved clinically in terms of his fluid overload, now with
   minimal pitting edema in the lower extremities and no crackles at the
   lung bases, with a CVP of 6. As over this morning he diuresed 1.2L. He
   could probably benefit from a little more diuresis, but very no more
   than 2.5L for the day. Another bolus of 20 cc IV lasix could be
   helpful. In terms of long-term medications, we restarted him on
   lisinopril 5 mg po qd and metoprolol 25 mg po bid. Since his HR is
   relatively well controlled, but his BP has been slightly high in the
   SBP 130s, we could go up on his lisinopril to 10 mg po qd. More
   complete management is better suited in the outpatient setting.
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes, hypertension, atrial flutter, and possible coronary artery disease. He underwent successful ablation for atrial flutter and is currently receiving heparin bridge therapy to achieve an INR of 2.0-3.0.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 90-103 bpm, blood pressure of 156/92 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. His respiratory support is minimal, and he is not requiring supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination is significant for mild wheezing in the right lower lung field, otherwise, his lungs are clear. His abdomen is soft, and he has minimal pitting edema in his lower extremities.

Laboratory results show that his white blood cell count is 9.4 K/uL, hemoglobin is 38.5 g/dL, and platelet count is 247 K/uL. His electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L.

The patient's medication list includes warfarin 5 mg po qd, metoprolol 25 mg po bid, lisinopril 5 mg po qd, and furosemide 40 mg IV q12h. He is also receiving heparin bridge therapy to achieve an INR of 2.0-3.0.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Bleeding complications due to the use of heparin and warfarin.
2. Thromboembolic disease, given the patient's CHADS2 score of 3-23, which puts him at a 6% risk for thromboembolic disease without anti-coagulation.
3. Hyperkalemia due to the use of furosemide and lisinopril.
4. Respiratory complications, given the patient's history of smoking and mild wheezing.
5. Cardiovascular complications, given the patient's history of atrial flutter and possible coronary artery disease.
6. Worsening of his diabetes, given the patient's history of diabetes and the use of insulin sliding scale.
7. Gastrointestinal complications, given the patient's history of dyslipidemia and the use of senna/colace for bowel regimen.

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be stable, and he is receiving appropriate treatment for his atrial flutter and other medical conditions. However, close monitoring is necessary to prevent potential complications and ensure that his treatment plan is effective."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 56 year old man with a history of morbid obesity, DM, HTN,
   who was transferred from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of
   atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER. The patient underwent ablation yesterday which
   successfully converted him to NSR.
   # ATRIAL FLUTTER: The patient has atrial flutter that has been
   difficult to rate control despite multiple agents for the past two days
   at [**Hospital3 **]. At the [**Hospital1 1**] his rate is still tachycardic in the
   110s-120s on diltiazen boluses. Since his tachyarrhythmia has been
   difficult to control on medical therapy, he will need electrical
   cardioversion to reverse his typical atrial flutter. In addition, he
   should have ablation to prevent recurrence of flutter. However, given
   the possibility that his flutter has been going on for the past 2 weeks
   and his CHADS2 score is [**2-23**] (4% risk of stroke), the risk of
   thromboembolism with cardioversion is high. Today he will have a TEE to
   assess for clot in the left atrium, and if there is no clot Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**] will do the cardioversion and ablation. After the procedure he
   will need to continue warfarin (goal INR 2.0-3.0) for at least 4 weeks.
   -          Diltiazem boluses until the procedure for rate control if HR
   is 130-150s, goal HR 80-120
   -          warfarin 5 mg po qd for goal INR 2.0-3.0
   -          heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal
   -          TEE to assess for clot
   -          Electrical cardioversion if no clot present with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 6092**]
   -          Ablation to prevent recurrent flutter
   # CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Given the history of increasing dyspnea on
   exertion for two weeks and the finding of atrial fibrillation with RVR
   in 170s on admission to [**Hospital3 **], the etiology of his CHF is
   most likely tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. His extremely high
   heart rate decreases diastolic filling time, thus decreasing preload
   and stroke volume, which decreases his cardiac output and forward flow.
   To add insult to injury, atrial fibrillation/flutter prevents the
   normal atrial kick from adding to cardiac output. Thus, tachycardiac is
   the most likely culprit. His report of sweats/chills during the two
   weeks prior to admission could have induced his tachyarrhythmia, but
   viral-induced cardiomyopathy on top of atrial flutter should remain on
   the differential given the vagueness of his symptoms. It is also
   possible that he has chronic CHF secondary to COPD and OSA given his
   history of smoking and body habitus, which may have caused his
   tachyarrhythmia, which then exacerbated his CHF. For further evaluation
   we would need PFTs, sleep studies, and a measurement of his heart
   pressures, but these could be performed as an outpatient. Other
   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   etiologies, such as ischemia-related and toxic cardiomyopathy, are less
   likely given no history of CAD, ACS, alcohol abuse, and cocaine abuse.
   Either way, he will need an echo as an outpatient in 6 months to assess
   if his cardiac function has recovered. At this time, he is largely
   improved after his lasix and diuresis at [**Hospital3 **], and he has
   diuresed about 400cc since admission here. He is still mildly fluid
   overloaded as evidenced by pitting edema in his calves. I/O goals for
   today after the procedure should be -1L , and we may consider lasix
   after he gets back to the floor.
   -          Electrical cardioversion and ablation should improve his
   cardiac output, resolving CHF
   -          I/O goal net -1L
   -          diltiazem for rate control, goal HR 80-100
   # WHEEZING: Given the patient
s extensive history of smoking, he is at
   risk for COPD. At the outside hospital he was started on multiple
   medications (duoneb, spiriva, solu-medrol and advair) to treat
   presumable COPD. However, since he is not symptomatic from wheezing and
   he satting low 90s on room air, specific treatment is better suited in
   the outpatient environment.
   .
   # CORONARIES: The patient has no evidence of CAD on EKG, but because
   his [**Location (un) 150**] risk score is 20% for MI in the next 10 years, he should
   be on a baby aspirin.
   .
   # DMII: Patient has history of diabetes. Sugars are high on admission.
   -          Insulin sliding scale
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Patient has history of dyslipidemia.
   -          Continue home regimen.
   .
   # HTN: The patient has a history of hypertension. However, given that
   lisinopril would tweak his hemodynamics, we will hold his home blood
   pressure medications.

   # FEN: NPO for TEE, cardiac diet afterwards
   # ACCESS: PIV's x2 18s
   # PROPHYLAXIS:
   -          DVT ppx: covered with heparin which we are using for his
   Coumadin bridge
   -          Bowel regimen with senna/colace

Based on the sub-intern progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and atrial flutter. He was transferred from another hospital for further management of atrial flutter and possible ablation/cardioversion.

The patient underwent ablation yesterday, which successfully converted him to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). He is currently being treated with diltiazem for rate control and warfarin for anticoagulation. He is also receiving heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.1°F, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 156/92 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 90% on nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), which is likely caused by tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. He is currently fluid-overloaded, with pitting edema in his calves, and is being treated with diuresis.

The patient also has a history of wheezing, which is likely caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is at risk for COPD due to his extensive history of smoking.

The patient has no evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) on EKG, but his Framingham risk score is 20% for myocardial infarction (MI) in the next 10 years, so he should be on a baby aspirin.

The patient has a history of diabetes and hyperlipidemia, and is being treated with insulin sliding scale and his home regimen, respectively.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Thromboembolism with cardioversion
* Recurrence of atrial flutter
* CHF exacerbation
* COPD exacerbation
* Coronary artery disease
* Myocardial infarction
* Stroke

The patient's plan is to undergo electrical cardioversion and ablation if no clot is present on TEE, and to continue warfarin for at least 4 weeks. He will also need to continue diltiazem for rate control and heparin sliding scale to bridge to INR goal. He will be monitored closely for any signs of complications."
