 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   ANEMIA
   Patient is hemodynamically stable. Hct in low 30's after transfusion.
   Patient being prepped for colonoscopy, which is to be done later today.
   Suspect right colon bleed given melena, no source in upper system by
   endoscopy, and relatively normal BUN/Creat ratio consistent with
   patient not being significantly volume depleted.  If patient bleeds
   aggressively today, would push for angiography.
   Patient intubated for procedures. Oxygenation good. Minute ventilation
   acceptable. If bleeding does not recur, would awaken patient and
   extubate.
   Patient unresponsive on exam but propofol in place. She had received
   several narcotics and benzodiazepines prior to transfer; initial
   somnolence likely related to that. Propofol started because she was
   pulling out tubes. Sounds as if she has had delirium in recent weeks.
   No evidence of CNS infection. Stool being checked for CDiff. Would stop
   all antibiotics except flagyl and monitor cultures.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 52-inch, 42.6 kg individual who was admitted with a chief complaint of GI bleed, anemia, and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated for upper endoscopy, which was negative for the source of bleeding. Neurosurgery tapped the VP shunt, revealing 2 WBC, 1 RBC, and glucose 69. The patient's blood pressure has been stable, and their Hct has increased to 33.8 after transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs. The patient is currently on ventilator support with good ABG's on FIO2 0.4.

The patient's 24-hour events include a multi-lumen start at 10:00 PM and an endoscopy at 12:00 AM. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, sulfa, acetaminophen, and Percocet. The patient is currently receiving propofol at 20 mcg/kg/min, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress, no signs of anxiety or diaphoresis, and no sclera edema. The patient's cardiovascular examination is normal, with a normal pulse and blood pressure. The patient's respiratory examination reveals symmetric expansion, clear breath sounds, and a few crackles on the right lateral and posterior chest.

The patient's laboratory results show a WBC count of 14.0, Hct of 33.8, and a platelet count of 207. The patient's creatinine is 0.6 mg/dL, and their troponin-T is 0.05 ng/mL. The patient's imaging studies, including a head CT and CXR, are normal.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is diagnosed with leukocytosis, gastrointestinal bleed, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, anemia, and is suspected to have a right colon bleed given the melena and normal BUN/Creat ratio. The patient is being prepped for colonoscopy, which is to be done later today. If the patient bleeds aggressively, angiography will be considered. The patient is intubated for procedures and is being monitored for oxygenation and minute ventilation. If the bleeding does not recur, the patient will be awakened and extubated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen if they continue to bleed, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity could lead to further skin breakdown and infection.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could worsen if they continue to receive sedatives and narcotics, leading to prolonged delirium and increased risk of falls and injury.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support could lead to respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly in the skin and respiratory tract, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed could lead to further bleeding, perforation, and obstruction, which could require surgical intervention.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiovascular status could worsen if they experience further bleeding, leading to hypovolemic shock and decreased cardiac output."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 42.6 kg child admitted to the ICU with a 24-hour event report. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 123/50 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 16 inspirations per minute and an oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a stable cardiac output and peripheral perfusion.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.0, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 207 K/uL. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's inability to assess certain areas, including peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic systems.

Potential medical complications:

1. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect their airway increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to respiratory failure and pneumonia.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and melena increases the risk of further bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure if not treated promptly.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin assessment is limited, but the presence of skin lesions or ulcers may increase the risk of infection and organ failure.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be a sign of underlying infection, sepsis, or organ failure, which can lead to poor outcomes if not treated promptly.
6. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's prolonged PT and PTT may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, which can lead to pulmonary embolism and organ failure.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of stress ulcer, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and organ failure.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and poor outcomes.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to identify any changes or complications.
2. Administer antibiotics and antifungals as indicated to prevent and treat potential infections.
3. Consider transferring the patient to a higher-level care facility if their condition worsens or if they require more advanced care.
4. Continue to provide mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy as indicated to maintain the patient's respiratory status.
5. Monitor the patient's coagulation profile and consider administering anticoagulants as indicated to prevent venous thromboembolism.
6. Consider administering stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Continue to provide nutritional support and glycemic control as indicated to maintain the patient's nutritional and metabolic status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-inch tall, 42.6 kg child who was admitted to the ICU due to unknown reasons. The patient has been extubated and is currently on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 123/50 mmHg.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and their laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 14.0, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 207 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and their blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are 10 mg/dL and 0.6 mg/dL, respectively.

The patient has a risk of aspiration due to their inability to protect their airway, and they are at risk for altered mental status due to their increased tone and non-purposeful movement. The patient's skin is cool, and they have impaired skin integrity.

The patient's assessment and plan include monitoring for airway, gastrointestinal bleed, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect their airway puts them at risk for aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and even death.
2. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding increases their risk of further bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock, anemia, and other complications.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's cool skin and impaired skin integrity put them at risk for further skin breakdown, which can lead to infection, sepsis, and other complications.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's increased tone and non-purposeful movement increase their risk of developing altered mental status, which can lead to delirium, agitation, and other complications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy increases their risk of developing respiratory failure, which can lead to pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and other complications.
6. Sepsis: The patient's impaired skin integrity and history of gastrointestinal bleeding increase their risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death."

   Assessment and Plan
   A 71 year old lady with recent stented MI, multiple medical problems
   presents with abdominal pain, recent nausea/vomiting, altered mental
   status and leukocytosis from outside hospital ED. She is minimally
   responsive, has poor venous access and comes with little outside
   information.
   .
   # Vent: Intubated for airway protection. Has good resp status prior to
   intubation.
   - use propofol for sedation given quicker metabolism. Her BPs have been
   holding stable
   - keep on PS overnight
   - SBT and RSBI in AM and extubate ASAP
   - routine vent care
   .
   # GIB: She does have hx of UGIB from ""ulcer"" at OSH. Presence of
   melantic stools also suggests UGI source, although could not rule out a
   high colonic bleed. Unfortunately, she is recently s/p LAD BMS and
   needs to be on ASA and plavix. GI will urgently scope tonight given
   that she cannot come off anti-plt therapy
   - [**Last Name (LF) 2643**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] place large bore PIV as well in case need for urgent volume
   - transfuse 2U PRBC now
   - apprec GI
   - [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI
   - Q4hr HCTs and transfuse to keep HCT up
   - send H. pylori
   - hold all antihypertensives
   - golytely overight and possible C-scope in AM
   - if continues to bleed, would to bleeding scan
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: CT abdomen pelvis reviewed and rules out obstruction,
   current volvulus, abscess, hemorrhage or obvious colitits. Viral
   gastroenteritis can be invoked, as can C. diff given recent
   institutionalization. This may be related to GIB
   - Serial abdominal exams
   - plan as above
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Concern for abdominal process, sepsis and central
   infection given her VP shunt. C. Diff also possible. U/A unrevealing.
   Reassured the lactate is normal, vital signs stable. Despite high WBC,
   otherwise not likely sepsis. Given high WBC count, C. diff is more
   likely than other infectious processes.
   - per neurosurgery no need for VP shunt tapping
   - Consider repeat LP attempt, although failued X 2 already and may need
   IR guided
   - Blood & Urine cultures
   - C. diff stools
   - Flagyl 500mg IV Q8 started on floor given high likelihood of C.diff.
   As now in ICU, would switch to PO vanc.
   - if worsens clincially, broaden to Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely due to infection and opioids/sedatives
   given in our and OSH EDs. Monitor with neuro exams and reassess if does
   not clear with appropriate drug metabolism. Of note, she has been
   getting progressively more unresponsive throughout the day, answering
   yes/no in AM, but now unresponsive to painful stimuli
   - consider LP if mental status does not clear; however, I have low
   clinical suspicion for meningitis
   - consider flumazenil and narcan to reverse benzos and opiates if
   mental status does not improve
   .
   # CAD s/p MI BMS [**1-9**]:
   - Continue ASA/Plavix despite bleeding risk
   - Hold Imdur, Lisinopril, HCTZ given GI Bleed
   - Continue Carvedilol for ischemic protection despite GI bleed risk.
   - Continue Simvastatin
   .
   # PVD: Has hx of recent pseudoaneurysm
   - Continue ASA/plavix, monitor distal pulses.
   .
   # COPD: Continue Spiriva, Nebs
   .
   # FEN: NPO while patient altered, maintenance IVF. Replete lytes PRN
   # PPX: Protonix IV, ASA/Plavix, Pneumoboot
   # Code: Full, Confirmed
   # Access: RIJ
   # Dispo: MICU for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old lady with a recent stented myocardial infarction (MI), multiple medical problems, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, altered mental status, and leukocytosis. She is intubated for airway protection and is receiving propofol for sedation. Her blood pressure has been stable, and she has been monitored for respiratory status.

The patient has a high risk of bleeding due to her recent MI and the need to continue antiplatelet therapy. She is scheduled for a colonoscopy to evaluate the source of her bleeding. She has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and may have a high colonic bleed. The patient is also at risk for sepsis and central infection due to her ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to infection and opioids/sedatives. She has been getting progressively more unresponsive throughout the day and is now unresponsive to painful stimuli.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a recent MI, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a history of pseudoaneurysm.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient is at high risk of bleeding due to her recent MI and the need to continue antiplatelet therapy.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of sepsis due to her VP shunt and the possibility of central infection.
3. Central infection: The patient is at risk of central infection due to her VP shunt.
4. C. difficile infection: The patient has a high WBC count and is at risk of C. difficile infection.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection and is at risk of respiratory failure.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and recent MI, and is at risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias and heart failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of VP shunt and is at risk of neurological complications such as meningitis and sepsis.

Assessment:

The patient is at high risk of bleeding, sepsis, and central infection due to her recent MI, VP shunt, and the possibility of C. difficile infection. She is also at risk of respiratory failure, cardiac complications, and neurological complications. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to infection and opioids/sedatives. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve her clinical outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   A 71 year old lady with recent stented MI, multiple medical problems
   presents with abdominal pain, recent nausea/vomiting, altered mental
   status and leukocytosis from outside hospital ED. She is minimally
   responsive, has poor venous access and comes with little outside
   information.
   .
   # Vent: Intubated for airway protection with AMS and prior to EGD. Has
   good resp status prior to intubation.
   - extubated yesterday, now on room air with normal oxygenation
   .
   # GIB: She does have hx of UGIB from ""ulcer"" at OSH. Presence of
   melantic stools also suggests UGI source, although could not rule out a
   high colonic bleed. Unfortunately, she is recently s/p LAD BMS and
   needs to be on ASA and plavix.

   - Q4hr HCTs and transfuse to keep HCT up
   - send H. pylori
   - hold all antihypertensives
   - golytely overight and possible C-scope in AM
   - if continues to bleed, would to bleeding scan
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: CT abdomen pelvis reviewed and rules out obstruction,
   current volvulus, abscess, hemorrhage or obvious colitits. Viral
   gastroenteritis can be invoked, as can C. diff given recent
   institutionalization. This may be related to GIB
   - Serial abdominal exams

   Reassured the lactate is normal, vital signs stable. Despite high WBC,
   otherwise not likely sepsis. Given high WBC count, C. diff is more
   likely than other infectious processes.
   - per neurosurgery no need for VP shunt tapping
   - Consider repeat LP attempt, although failued X 2 already and may need

   - Blood & Urine cultures
   - C. diff stools
   - Flagyl 500mg IV Q8 started on floor given high likelihood of C.diff.
   As now in ICU, would switch to PO vanc.
   - if worsens clincially, broaden to Vanc/Zosyn
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Likely due to infection and opioids/sedatives
   given in our and OSH EDs. Monitor with neuro exams and reassess if does
   not clear with appropriate drug metabolism. Of note, she has been
   getting progressively more unresponsive throughout the day, answering
   yes/no in AM, but now unresponsive to painful stimuli
   - consider LP if mental status does not clear; however, I have low
   clinical suspicion for meningitis
   - consider flumazenil and narcan to reverse benzos and opiates if
   mental status does not improve

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 71-year-old lady with a recent stented MI, multiple medical problems, and a history of UGIB.
* She is currently in the ICU, intubated for airway protection, and has been extubated and placed on room air with normal oxygenation.
* She has abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, altered mental status, and leukocytosis.
* Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 123/50 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
* Her laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate a bleeding diathesis or infection.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB):** The patient has a history of UGIB and is at risk for further bleeding due to her anticoagulant therapy and recent stented MI. Close monitoring of her bleeding status and transfusion of blood products as needed are crucial.
2. **Infection:** The patient's leukocytosis and altered mental status may indicate an underlying infection, such as C. difficile colitis or sepsis. Blood and urine cultures should be repeated, and empiric antibiotic therapy should be considered.
3. **Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI):** The patient has a urinary catheter in place, which increases her risk of developing a CAUTI. Close monitoring of her urinary tract symptoms and urine cultures should be performed.
4. **Central nervous system (CNS) infection:** The patient's altered mental status and recent VP shunt placement increase her risk of developing a CNS infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis. Consideration should be given to repeating the lumbar puncture and sending cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures.
5. **Respiratory failure:** The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is at risk for developing respiratory failure due to her underlying lung disease and potential aspiration.
6. **Cardiovascular complications:** The patient has a history of CAD and recent MI, which increases her risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.

**Plan:**

* Continue ASA and Plavix despite bleeding risk.
* Monitor bleeding status and transfuse blood products as needed.
* Repeat blood and urine cultures and consider empiric antibiotic therapy.
* Consider repeating the lumbar puncture and sending CSF cultures.
* Monitor respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
* Continue cardiac medications, including ASA, Plavix, carvedilol, and simvastatin.

   Assessment and Plan
   A 71 year old lady with recent stented MI, multiple medical problems
   presents with abdominal pain, recent nausea/vomiting, altered mental
   status and leukocytosis from outside hospital ED. She is minimally
   responsive, has poor venous access and comes with little outside
   information.
   .
   # Vent: Intubated for airway protection with AMS and prior to EGD. Has
   good resp status prior to intubation.
   -extubated yesterday, now on room air with normal oxygenation
   - did not have respiratory failure
   .
   # GIB: She does have hx of UGIB from ""ulcer"" at OSH. Presence of
   melantic stools also suggests UGI source, although could not rule out a
   high colonic bleed. Unfortunately, she is recently s/p LAD BMS and
   needs to be on ASA and plavix.

   # Leukocytosis: Concern for abdominal process, sepsis and central
   infection given her VP shunt. C. Diff also possible. U/A unrevealing.
   Reassured the lactate is normal, vital signs stable. Despite high WBC,
   otherwise not likely sepsis. Given high WBC count, C. diff is more

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a recent stented myocardial infarction (MI), multiple medical problems, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, altered mental status, and leukocytosis. She was intubated for airway protection and underwent an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD). The patient was extubated yesterday and is now on room air with normal oxygenation. She has a history of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and is taking aspirin and clopidogrel for her MI. She also has a history of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 123/50 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Her white blood cell count is 14.0 x 10^9/L, and her hemoglobin is 9.1 g/dL.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated troponin-T level of 0.05 ng/mL, indicating possible cardiac injury. Her creatinine level is 0.6 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 10 mg/dL. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are within normal limits.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Ventilation: Intubated for airway protection, now on room air with normal oxygenation
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: Plan for clears today, go lytely tonight, scope tomorrow
* Abdominal pain: Serial abdominal exams, plan as above for bleed
* Leukocytosis: Trending downward, no meningitis, likely C. diff
* Altered mental status: Monitor with neuro exams and reassess if does not clear with appropriate drug metabolism
* Cardiac disease: Continue ASA/Plavix despite bleeding risk, hold Imdur, Lisinopril, HCTZ given GI bleed, continue Carvedilol for ischemic protection
* Peripheral vascular disease: Continue ASA/Plavix, monitor distal pulses
* COPD: Continue Spiriva, Nebs
* Fluid management: Monitor fluid status, replete lytes PRN

Potential medical complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of PUD and current GIB make her at risk for further bleeding.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent MI and ongoing cardiac disease make her at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and possible C. diff infection make her at risk for further infection.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD and current respiratory status make her at risk for respiratory failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and possible C. diff infection make her at risk for neurological complications, such as meningitis or encephalopathy.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels make her at risk for renal failure.
7. Septic shock: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and possible infection make her at risk for septic shock."
