           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species. Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion.
   BLOOD CULTURE: NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock
   , hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   Improved yesterday but worsened again this AM, back on levophed this
   morning. [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2
   species ([**1-7**] pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It
   is unclear where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here
   still pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due
   to staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is satting well
   on NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc and cefepime
   - discontinue azithromycin as pt does not seem to have lung infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - Follow lactate
   -  Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible, would
   ideally check CVP but difficult with femoral CVL
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - consider ECHO to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improving with IVF. The most likely etiology is
   hypovolemic. She continues to have free water deficit of 3.3 liter
   today.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given likely
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - D5W at 100cc / hr for 28 hours (to get Na down to 140)
   - Follow up pm sodium
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr went
   down from 3.0 to 2.0. Per notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5.
   Etiologies include pre-renal and ATN in the setting of severe volume
   depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today, down from 13 yesterday.
   Albumin 2.9. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal failure with
   uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. Uremia and lactic acidosis
   improving. She appears to be fully respiratorily compensated at present
   without any additional non-gap or respiratory process. Should she
   appear to tire or otherwise be unable to compensate, will need to
   consider intubation. However, pt is DNR and DNI.
   - Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue [**Year (4 digits) 119**] 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Unclear etiology. Non-cardiac. Might be due to lying in
   bed withoug moving around chronically. TSH normal, so unlikely due to
   hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multifactorial picture in setting
   of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - update family and discuss with daughter
   ICU [**Name2 (NI) 151**]
   Nutrition: NPO for now
   Glycemic Control:  Insulin sliding scale as needed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):
   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2111-8-5**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species. Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion.
   BLOOD CULTURE: NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock
   , hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   Improved yesterday but worsened again this AM, back on levophed this
   morning. [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2
   species ([**1-7**] pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It
   is unclear where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here
   still pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due
   to staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is satting well
   on NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc and cefepime
   - discontinue azithromycin as pt does not seem to have lung infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - Follow lactate
   -  Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible, would
   ideally check CVP but difficult with femoral CVL
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - consider ECHO to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improving with IVF. The most likely etiology is
   hypovolemic. She continues to have free water deficit of 3.3 liter
   today.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given likely
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - D5W at 100cc / hr for 28 hours (to get Na down to 140)
   - Follow up pm sodium
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr went
   down from 3.0 to 2.0. Per notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5.
   Etiologies include pre-renal and ATN in the setting of severe volume
   depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today, down from 13 yesterday.
   Albumin 2.9. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal failure with
   uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. Uremia and lactic acidosis
   improving. She appears to be fully respiratorily compensated at present
   without any additional non-gap or respiratory process. Should she
   appear to tire or otherwise be unable to compensate, will need to
   consider intubation. However, pt is DNR and DNI.
   - Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue [**Year (4 digits) 119**] 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Unclear etiology. Non-cardiac. Might be due to lying in
   bed withoug moving around chronically. TSH normal, so unlikely due to
   hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multifactorial picture in setting
   of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - update family and discuss with daughter

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, an 87-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with septic shock, hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's condition has worsened, and she is currently on levophed and vasopressin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's septic shock is not fully controlled, and she is still experiencing hypotension. The source of the bacteremia is unclear, and the patient may require further interventions to control the infection.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is improving with IVF, but she still has a free water deficit of 3.3 liters. The patient may require further fluid management to correct her sodium levels.
3. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function is improving with IVF, but she still has elevated creatinine levels. The patient may require further monitoring and potential interventions to improve her renal function.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is improving, but she still has an anion gap of 10. The patient may require further interventions to correct her acid-base imbalance.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but she may require further evaluation and management to address the underlying cause.
6. Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin levels are trending down, but she may still require further monitoring and potential interventions to address the underlying cause.
7. AAA: The patient's AAA is enlarged, and she may require further evaluation and management to address the potential risks associated with it.
8. Elevated CK: The patient's CK levels are elevated, but the etiology is unclear. The patient may require further evaluation and management to address the underlying cause.
9. Mental status/Failure to thrive: The patient's mental status is declining, and she may require further evaluation and management to address the underlying causes.
10. Goals of care: The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her family has been updated on her condition. The patient's goals of care should be discussed with her family and healthcare providers to ensure that her wishes are respected.

In summary, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including septic shock, hypernatremia, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, metabolic acidosis, anemia, elevated troponin, AAA, elevated CK, and mental status/failure to thrive. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address these potential complications and ensure the patient's comfort and well-being."

   BLOOD CULTURE: NGTD
   IMAGING: CXR today: my read: no acute cardiopulmonary process. RML
   opacity seen yesterday has resolved.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female with history of chronic renal
   insufficieny, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and
   hypertension who presents with hypotension, leukocytosis,
   hypernatremia, and worsening renal function.
   .
   #) Sepsis:
   Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis. Most likely source is
   urinary, though GI or pulmonary source are also possible. Patient given
   liters of fluid, antibiotics, and started on pressors in ED, and line
   placed at that time. Other possibilities to consider would be
   cardiogenic shock, PE (less likely given no tachycardia, no huge A-a
   gradient)
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear), as suspect profoundly
   volume depleted and may need several more liters
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - Continue antibiotics, would expand to include better gram negative
   coverage given question of UTI with Zosyn (versus ciprofloxacin), and
   add azthromycin for atypical coverage.
   - Follow lactate, would ideally check CVP, UOP
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data (at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible
   - Follow up CXR and CT reads
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - Repeat CXR after hydration
   - Checking legionella antigen
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Given history, suspect most likely etiology is
   hypovolemic. Her free water deficit is approximately 4 liters.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given unknown
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - Follow up sodium q2-3 hours
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Per notes, baseline creatinine
   around 1.5, currently 3.0 with elevated BUN. Suspect this is
   multifactorial from pre-renal low intravascular state coupled with
   continuation of lasix and lisinopril. Given hypotension, suspect there
   is also component of ATN for unknown duration.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Re-send urine to examine for casts, etc (sent at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 17, though albumin pending, so may
   actually be higher. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal
   failure with uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. She appears to
   be fully respiratorily compensated at present without any additional
   non-gap or respiratory process. Should she appear to tire or otherwise
   be unable to compensate, will need to consider intubation.
   -          Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   -          Checking albumin
   .
   #) Anemia: Appears hemo-concentrated at this time from recent baseline
   of 26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from
   [**12/2110**] with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: EKG demonstrated no findings concerning for acute
   ischemia. CK is flat. Tropinin markedly elevated, but in setting of
   prior elevated troponin (0.674 [**5-/2111**]) and renal insufficiency.
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   - Follow up EKG this AM
   - Continue [**Year (4 digits) 119**] 325 mg

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   BLOOD CULTURE: NGTD
   IMAGING: CXR today: my read: no acute cardiopulmonary process. RML
   opacity seen yesterday has resolved.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female with history of chronic renal
   insufficieny, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and
   hypertension who presents with hypotension, leukocytosis,
   hypernatremia, and worsening renal function.
   .
   #) Sepsis:
   Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis. Most likely source is
   urinary, though GI or pulmonary source are also possible. Patient given
   liters of fluid, antibiotics, and started on pressors in ED, and line
   placed at that time. Other possibilities to consider would be
   cardiogenic shock, PE (less likely given no tachycardia, no huge A-a
   gradient)
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear), as suspect profoundly
   volume depleted and may need several more liters
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - Continue antibiotics, would expand to include better gram negative
   coverage given question of UTI with Zosyn (versus ciprofloxacin), and
   add azthromycin for atypical coverage.
   - Follow lactate, would ideally check CVP, UOP
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data (at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible
   - Follow up CXR and CT reads
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - Repeat CXR after hydration
   - Checking legionella antigen
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Given history, suspect most likely etiology is
   hypovolemic. Her free water deficit is approximately 4 liters.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given unknown
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - Follow up sodium q2-3 hours
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Per notes, baseline creatinine
   around 1.5, currently 3.0 with elevated BUN. Suspect this is
   multifactorial from pre-renal low intravascular state coupled with
   continuation of lasix and lisinopril. Given hypotension, suspect there
   is also component of ATN for unknown duration.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Re-send urine to examine for casts, etc (sent at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 17, though albumin pending, so may
   actually be higher. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal
   failure with uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. She appears to
   be fully respiratorily compensated at present without any additional
   non-gap or respiratory process. Should she appear to tire or otherwise
   be unable to compensate, will need to consider intubation.
   -          Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   -          Checking albumin
   .
   #) Anemia: Appears hemo-concentrated at this time from recent baseline
   of 26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from
   [**12/2110**] with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: EKG demonstrated no findings concerning for acute
   ischemia. CK is flat. Tropinin markedly elevated, but in setting of
   prior elevated troponin (0.674 [**5-/2111**]) and renal insufficiency.
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   - Follow up EKG this AM
   - Continue [**Year (4 digits) 119**] 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation
   - Follow pulses
   - Follow up final CT read
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive:
   Per daughter, has had marked decline over the last several months,
   worsening over the last several days. Poor PO intake.
   Suspect this is multifactorial picture in setting of underlying
   dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of chronic renal insufficiency, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and hypertension, who presents with hypotension, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and worsening renal function. She has a urinary tract infection, and her condition is complicated by sepsis, metabolic acidosis, anemia, and elevated troponin levels. She is currently receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and pressors, and is being monitored closely for signs of respiratory decline.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely due to a urinary tract infection, and she may require further antibiotics and treatment to resolve the infection.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's anion gap is 17, which may indicate a more severe metabolic acidosis. She may require further treatment to correct this condition.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she may have acute kidney injury due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or other factors.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, and she may have cardiac complications such as acute coronary syndrome or cardiogenic shock.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and she may require treatment to correct this condition.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic disease, and she may require further evaluation and treatment to correct this condition.
7. Failure to Thrive: The patient's poor oral intake and weight loss may indicate a failure to thrive, and she may require further evaluation and treatment to address this condition.
8. AAA: The patient's abdominal aortic aneurysm is enlarged, and she may require further evaluation and treatment to address this condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV fluids and antibiotics to treat sepsis and urinary tract infection.
2. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as needed to correct metabolic acidosis and hypernatremia.
3. Consider further evaluation and treatment for acute kidney injury, cardiac complications, and anemia.
4. Address the patient's poor oral intake and weight loss with nutritional support and further evaluation.
5. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's abdominal aortic aneurysm.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
7. Continue to communicate with the patient's family and update them on her condition and treatment plan."

URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):
   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2111-8-5**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species. Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion.
   IMAGING: CXR today: my read: no acute cardiopulmonary process. RML
   opacity seen yesterday has resolved.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female with history of chronic renal
   insufficieny, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and
   hypertension who presents with hypotension, leukocytosis,
   hypernatremia, and worsening renal function.
   .
   #) Sepsis:
   Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis. Most likely source is
   urinary, though GI or pulmonary source are also possible. Patient given
   liters of fluid, antibiotics, and started on pressors in ED, and line
   placed at that time. Other possibilities to consider would be
   cardiogenic shock, PE (less likely given no tachycardia, no huge A-a
   gradient)
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear), as suspect profoundly
   volume depleted and may need several more liters
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - Continue antibiotics, would expand to include better gram negative
   coverage given question of UTI with Zosyn (versus ciprofloxacin), and
   add azthromycin for atypical coverage.
   - Follow lactate, would ideally check CVP, UOP
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data (at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible
   - Follow up CXR and CT reads
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - Repeat CXR after hydration
   - Checking legionella antigen
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Given history, suspect most likely etiology is
   hypovolemic. Her free water deficit is approximately 4 liters.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given unknown
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - Follow up sodium q2-3 hours
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Per notes, baseline creatinine
   around 1.5, currently 3.0 with elevated BUN. Suspect this is
   multifactorial from pre-renal low intravascular state coupled with
   continuation of lasix and lisinopril. Given hypotension, suspect there
   is also component of ATN for unknown duration.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Re-send urine to examine for casts, etc (sent at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 17, though albumin pending, so may
   actually be higher. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal
   failure with uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. She appears to
   be fully respiratorily compensated at present without any additional
   non-gap or respiratory process. Should she appear to tire or otherwise
   be unable to compensate, will need to consider intubation.
   -          Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   -          Checking albumin
   .
   #) Anemia: Appears hemo-concentrated at this time from recent baseline
   of 26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from
   [**12/2110**] with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: EKG demonstrated no findings concerning for acute
   ischemia. CK is flat. Tropinin markedly elevated, but in setting of
   prior elevated troponin (0.674 [**5-/2111**]) and renal insufficiency.
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   - Follow up EKG this AM
   - Continue [**Year (4 digits) 119**] 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation
   - Follow pulses
   - Follow up final CT read
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive:
   Per daughter, has had marked decline over the last several months,
   worsening over the last several days. Poor PO intake.
   Suspect this is multifactorial picture in setting of underlying
   dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) FEN:
   - IVF as noted above, bolusing as need to maintain MAP, following
   electrolytes.
   - Monitoring and repleting electrolytes as discussed above.
   - NPO for now
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   .
   #) Access: Currently has femoral triple lumen and one 20 gage
   peripheral
   - Femoral line will need to be resited to non-femoral site
   .
   #) Code:  Full--called daughter and updated her and discussed recent
   events. Per daughter, patient is full code. The family wished to hold
   off on intubation for purposes of the CT scan downstairs, but would
   want intubation if has respiratory decline. Daughter will come in very
   soon to talk about this further.
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species. Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion.
   IMAGING: CXR today: my read: no acute cardiopulmonary process. RML
   opacity seen yesterday has resolved.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female with history of chronic renal
   insufficieny, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and
   hypertension who presents with hypotension, leukocytosis,
   hypernatremia, and worsening renal function.
   .
   #) Sepsis:
   Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis. Most likely source is
   urinary, though GI or pulmonary source are also possible. Patient given
   liters of fluid, antibiotics, and started on pressors in ED, and line
   placed at that time. Other possibilities to consider would be
   cardiogenic shock, PE (less likely given no tachycardia, no huge A-a
   gradient)
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear), as suspect profoundly
   volume depleted and may need several more liters
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - Continue antibiotics, would expand to include better gram negative
   coverage given question of UTI with Zosyn (versus ciprofloxacin), and
   add azthromycin for atypical coverage.
   - Follow lactate, would ideally check CVP, UOP
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data (at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible
   - Follow up CXR and CT reads
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - Repeat CXR after hydration
   - Checking legionella antigen
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Given history, suspect most likely etiology is
   hypovolemic. Her free water deficit is approximately 4 liters.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given unknown
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - Follow up sodium q2-3 hours
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Per notes, baseline creatinine
   around 1.5, currently 3.0 with elevated BUN. Suspect this is
   multifactorial from pre-renal low intravascular state coupled with
   continuation of lasix and lisinopril. Given hypotension, suspect there
   is also component of ATN for unknown duration.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Re-send urine to examine for casts, etc (sent at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 17, though albumin pending, so may
   actually be higher. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal
   failure with uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. She appears to
   be fully respiratorily compensated at present without any additional
   non-gap or respiratory process. Should she appear to tire or otherwise
   be unable to compensate, will need to consider intubation.
   -          Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   -          Checking albumin
   .
   #) Anemia: Appears hemo-concentrated at this time from recent baseline
   of 26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from
   [**12/2110**] with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: EKG demonstrated no findings concerning for acute
   ischemia. CK is flat. Tropinin markedly elevated, but in setting of
   prior elevated troponin (0.674 [**5-/2111**]) and renal insufficiency.
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   - Follow up EKG this AM
   - Continue [**Year (4 digits) 119**] 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation
   - Follow pulses
   - Follow up final CT read
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive:
   Per daughter, has had marked decline over the last several months,
   worsening over the last several days. Poor PO intake.
   Suspect this is multifactorial picture in setting of underlying
   dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) FEN:
   - IVF as noted above, bolusing as need to maintain MAP, following
   electrolytes.
   - Monitoring and repleting electrolytes as discussed above.
   - NPO for now
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   .
   #) Access: Currently has femoral triple lumen and one 20 gage
   peripheral
   - Femoral line will need to be resited to non-femoral site
   .
   #) Code:  Full--called daughter and updated her and discussed recent
   events. Per daughter, patient is full code. The family wished to hold
   off on intubation for purposes of the CT scan downstairs, but would
   want intubation if has respiratory decline. Daughter will come in very
   soon to talk about this further.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of chronic renal insufficiency, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and hypertension. She was admitted with hypotension, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and worsening renal function. The patient is currently in the ICU with sepsis, metabolic acidosis, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, elevated troponin, and abdominal aortic aneurysm.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 85 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 122/74 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.5 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL
* Creatinine: 3.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 40 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: sodium 153 mmol/L, potassium 4.7 mmol/L, chloride 99 mmol/L
* Troponin: 0.44 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* LDH: 512 IU/L
* Calcium: 6.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.9 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: clear
* Computed tomography (CT) scan: enlarged abdominal aortic aneurysm, no signs of dissection or extravasation

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General: moaning in bed, moving all extremities and rolling from side to side
* HEENT: sclera anicteric, dry mucous membranes, oropharynx clear
* Neck: supple, JVP not elevated, no LAD
* Lungs: clear anteriorly bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or ronchi
* CV: regular rate and rhythm, systolic murmur radiates to carotid, soft diastolic murmur, S1 + S2, no rubs or gallops
* Abdomen: soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
* GU: Foley in place, brown stool noted
* Ext: feet warm, radial pulses palpable bilaterally, non-palpable DP pulses, no cyanosis or edema
* Neuro: unable to complete pupil examination, opens eyes on command, moving all extremities equally, calling out at times
* Skin: no lesions noted

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis: the patient is at risk for sepsis due to her urinary tract infection, which may lead to septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction.
* Metabolic acidosis: the patient's anion gap is elevated, which may indicate a metabolic acidosis. This could be due to her acute renal failure, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis.
* Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: the patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate acute kidney injury. This could be due to her hypotension, pre-renal azotemia, and continued use of lasix and lisinopril.
* Anemia: the patient's hemoglobin level is low, which may indicate anemia. This could be due to her chronic renal insufficiency, anemia, and bleeding.
* Elevated troponin: the patient's troponin level is elevated, which may indicate cardiac injury. This could be due to her hypotension, pre-renal azotemia, and continued use of lasix and lisinopril.
* Abdominal aortic aneurysm: the patient's abdominal aortic aneurysm is enlarged, which may increase her risk for rupture and bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* IV fluids to maintain urine output and electrolyte balance
* Antibiotics to treat urinary tract infection
* Vasopressors to maintain blood pressure
* Monitoring of electrolytes and acid-base status
* Follow-up imaging studies to evaluate the patient's abdominal aortic aneurysm and potential cardiac injury
* Social work consult to discuss the patient's goals of care and end-of-life issues
* Hold off on LP or head CT at present given the patient's multiple medical issues and potential for bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female with history of chronic renal
   insufficieny, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and
   hypertension who presents with hypotension, leukocytosis,
   hypernatremia, and worsening renal function.
   .
   #) Sepsis:
   Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis. Most likely source is
   urinary, though GI or pulmonary source are also possible. Patient given
   liters of fluid, antibiotics, and started on pressors in ED, and line
   placed at that time. Other possibilities to consider would be
   cardiogenic shock, PE (less likely given no tachycardia, no huge A-a
   gradient)
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear), as suspect profoundly
   volume depleted and may need several more liters
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - Continue antibiotics, would expand to include better gram negative
   coverage given question of UTI with Zosyn (versus ciprofloxacin), and
   add azthromycin for atypical coverage.
   - Follow lactate, would ideally check CVP, UOP
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data (at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible
   - Follow up CXR and CT reads
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - Repeat CXR after hydration
   - Checking legionella antigen
   - ECHO to r/o endocarditis in presence of coag-neg staph
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Given history, suspect most likely etiology is
   hypovolemic. Her free water deficit is approximately 4 liters.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given unknown
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - Follow up sodium q2-3 hours
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Per notes, baseline creatinine
   around 1.5, currently 3.0 with elevated BUN. Suspect this is
   multifactorial from pre-renal low intravascular state coupled with
   continuation of lasix and lisinopril. Given hypotension, suspect there
   is also component of ATN for unknown duration.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Re-send urine to examine for casts, etc (sent at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 17, though albumin pending, so may
   actually be higher. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal
   failure with uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. She appears to
   be fully respiratorily compensated at present without any additional
   non-gap or respiratory process. Should she appear to tire or otherwise
   be unable to compensate, will need to consider intubation.
   -          Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   -          Checking albumin
   .
   #) Anemia: Appears hemo-concentrated at this time from recent baseline
   of 26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from
   [**12/2110**] with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: EKG demonstrated no findings concerning for acute
   ischemia. CK is flat. Tropinin markedly elevated, but in setting of
   prior elevated troponin (0.674 [**5-/2111**]) and renal insufficiency.
   - Follow up EKG this AM
   - Continue [**Year (4 digits) 119**] 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   - Follow up final CT read
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive:
   Per daughter, has had marked decline over the last several months,
   worsening over the last several days. Poor PO intake.
   Suspect this is multifactorial picture in setting of underlying
   dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) FEN:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species. Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion.
   BLOOD CULTURE: NGTD
   IMAGING: CXR today: my read: no acute cardiopulmonary process. RML
   opacity seen yesterday has resolved.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female with history of chronic renal
   insufficieny, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and
   hypertension who presents with hypotension, leukocytosis,
   hypernatremia, and worsening renal function.
   .
   #) Sepsis:
   Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis. Most likely source is
   urinary, though GI or pulmonary source are also possible. Patient given
   liters of fluid, antibiotics, and started on pressors in ED, and line
   placed at that time. Other possibilities to consider would be
   cardiogenic shock, PE (less likely given no tachycardia, no huge A-a
   gradient)
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear), as suspect profoundly
   volume depleted and may need several more liters
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - Continue antibiotics, would expand to include better gram negative
   coverage given question of UTI with Zosyn (versus ciprofloxacin), and
   add azthromycin for atypical coverage.
   - Follow lactate, would ideally check CVP, UOP
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data (at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible
   - Follow up CXR and CT reads
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - Repeat CXR after hydration
   - Checking legionella antigen
   - ECHO to r/o endocarditis in presence of coag-neg staph
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Given history, suspect most likely etiology is
   hypovolemic. Her free water deficit is approximately 4 liters.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given unknown
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - Follow up sodium q2-3 hours
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Per notes, baseline creatinine
   around 1.5, currently 3.0 with elevated BUN. Suspect this is
   multifactorial from pre-renal low intravascular state coupled with
   continuation of lasix and lisinopril. Given hypotension, suspect there
   is also component of ATN for unknown duration.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Re-send urine to examine for casts, etc (sent at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 17, though albumin pending, so may
   actually be higher. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal
   failure with uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. She appears to
   be fully respiratorily compensated at present without any additional
   non-gap or respiratory process. Should she appear to tire or otherwise
   be unable to compensate, will need to consider intubation.
   -          Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   -          Checking albumin
   .
   #) Anemia: Appears hemo-concentrated at this time from recent baseline
   of 26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from
   [**12/2110**] with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: EKG demonstrated no findings concerning for acute
   ischemia. CK is flat. Tropinin markedly elevated, but in setting of
   prior elevated troponin (0.674 [**5-/2111**]) and renal insufficiency.
   - Follow up EKG this AM
   - Continue [**Year (4 digits) 119**] 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   - Follow up final CT read
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive:
   Per daughter, has had marked decline over the last several months,
   worsening over the last several days. Poor PO intake.
   Suspect this is multifactorial picture in setting of underlying
   dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) FEN:
   - IVF as noted above, bolusing as need to maintain MAP, following
   electrolytes.
   - Monitoring and repleting electrolytes as discussed above.
   - NPO for now
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   .
   #) Access: Currently has femoral triple lumen and one 20 gage
   peripheral
   - Femoral line will need to be resited to non-femoral site
   .

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic renal insufficiency, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and hypertension. She is currently in the ICU due to sepsis, hypernatremia, acute on chronic renal insufficiency, metabolic acidosis, anemia, and elevated troponin.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is receiving nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and her SpO2 is 99%. Her ABG shows a pH of 7.30, with a pCO2 of 30 mmHg, and a pO2 of 119 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a systolic murmur radiating to the carotid, and a soft diastolic murmur. Her blood pressure is 122/74 mmHg.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is 3.0 mg/dL, and her BUN is 49 mg/dL. She has a free water deficit of 3.3 L, and is receiving D5W at 90 cc/hr.
* Electrolytes: The patient's sodium level is 153 mEq/L, and her potassium level is 3.7 mEq/L.
* Infections: The patient has a urinary tract infection, as evidenced by the presence of leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and worsening renal function. She is also at risk for pneumonia and sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: The patient's diagnosis of sepsis is supported by her elevated white blood cell count, hypernatremia, and worsening renal function. She is at risk for further deterioration and organ failure.
* Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and BUN suggest acute kidney injury, which can worsen her underlying chronic renal insufficiency.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap of 17 and her pH of 7.30 suggest metabolic acidosis, which can worsen her underlying chronic kidney disease.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to her underlying chronic kidney disease and may worsen if her kidney function continues to decline.
* Elevated troponin: The patient's elevated troponin level suggests cardiac injury, which may be due to her underlying chronic kidney disease or other cardiac conditions.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal
* Continuation of antibiotics for sepsis
* Expansion of antibiotic coverage to include better gram-negative coverage
* Monitoring of lactate levels and venous saturation
* Follow-up culture data
* ECHO to rule out endocarditis
* Replacement of central venous line to a non-femoral site
* Follow-up CXR and CT scans
* Monitoring of electrolytes and acid-base status
* Consideration of intubation if the patient's respiratory status worsens."

URINE CULTURE (Preliminary):
   Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2111-8-5**]):
      NEGATIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
           (Reference Range-Negative).
      Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
      A negative result does not rule out infection due to other L.
      pneumophila serogroups or other Legionella species. Furthermore, in
      infected patients the excretion.
   BLOOD CULTURE: NGTD
   IMAGING: CXR today: my read: no acute cardiopulmonary process. RML
   opacity seen yesterday has resolved.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female with history of chronic renal
   insufficieny, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and
   hypertension who presents with hypotension, leukocytosis,
   hypernatremia, and worsening renal function.
   .
   #) Sepsis:
   Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis. Most likely source is
   urinary, though GI or pulmonary source are also possible. Patient given
   liters of fluid, antibiotics, and started on pressors in ED, and line
   placed at that time. Other possibilities to consider would be
   cardiogenic shock, PE (less likely given no tachycardia, no huge A-a
   gradient)
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear), as suspect profoundly
   volume depleted and may need several more liters
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - Continue antibiotics, would expand to include better gram negative
   coverage given question of UTI with Zosyn (versus ciprofloxacin), and
   add azthromycin for atypical coverage.
   - Follow lactate, would ideally check CVP, UOP
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data (at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible
   - Follow up CXR and CT reads
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - Repeat CXR after hydration
   - Checking legionella antigen
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Given history, suspect most likely etiology is
   hypovolemic. Her free water deficit is approximately 4 liters.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given unknown
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - Follow up sodium q2-3 hours
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Per notes, baseline creatinine
   around 1.5, currently 3.0 with elevated BUN. Suspect this is
   multifactorial from pre-renal low intravascular state coupled with
   continuation of lasix and lisinopril. Given hypotension, suspect there
   is also component of ATN for unknown duration.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Re-send urine to examine for casts, etc (sent at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 17, though albumin pending, so may
   actually be higher. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal
   failure with uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. She appears to
   be fully respiratorily compensated at present without any additional
   non-gap or respiratory process. Should she appear to tire or otherwise
   be unable to compensate, will need to consider intubation.
   -          Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   -          Checking albumin
   .
   #) Anemia: Appears hemo-concentrated at this time from recent baseline
   of 26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from
   [**12/2110**] with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: EKG demonstrated no findings concerning for acute
   ischemia. CK is flat. Tropinin markedly elevated, but in setting of
   prior elevated troponin (0.674 [**5-/2111**]) and renal insufficiency.
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   - Follow up EKG this AM
   - Continue [**Year (4 digits) 119**] 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation
   - Follow pulses
   - Follow up final CT read
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive:
   Per daughter, has had marked decline over the last several months,
   worsening over the last several days. Poor PO intake.
   Suspect this is multifactorial picture in setting of underlying
   dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) FEN:
   - IVF as noted above, bolusing as need to maintain MAP, following
   electrolytes.
   - Monitoring and repleting electrolytes as discussed above.
   - NPO for now
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   .
   #) Access: Currently has femoral triple lumen and one 20 gage
   peripheral
   - Femoral line will need to be resited to non-femoral site
   .
   #) Code:  Full--called daughter and updated her and discussed recent
   events. Per daughter, patient is full code. The family wished to hold
   off on intubation for purposes of the CT scan downstairs, but would
   want intubation if has respiratory decline. Daughter will come in very
   soon to talk about this further.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   insufficieny, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and
   hypertension who presents with hypotension, leukocytosis,
   hypernatremia, and worsening renal function.
   .
   #) Sepsis:
   Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis. Most likely source is
   urinary, though GI or pulmonary source are also possible. Patient given
   liters of fluid, antibiotics, and started on pressors in ED, and line
   placed at that time. Other possibilities to consider would be
   cardiogenic shock, PE (less likely given no tachycardia, no huge A-a
   gradient)
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear), as suspect profoundly
   volume depleted and may need several more liters
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - Continue antibiotics, would expand to include better gram negative
   coverage given question of UTI with Zosyn (versus ciprofloxacin), and
   add azthromycin for atypical coverage.
   - Follow lactate, would ideally check CVP, UOP
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data (at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible
   - Follow up CXR and CT reads
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - Repeat CXR after hydration
   - Checking legionella antigen
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Given history, suspect most likely etiology is
   hypovolemic. Her free water deficit is approximately 4 liters.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given unknown
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - Follow up sodium q2-3 hours
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Per notes, baseline creatinine
   around 1.5, currently 3.0 with elevated BUN. Suspect this is
   multifactorial from pre-renal low intravascular state coupled with
   continuation of lasix and lisinopril. Given hypotension, suspect there
   is also component of ATN for unknown duration.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Re-send urine to examine for casts, etc (sent at [**Location (un) 3**])
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 17, though albumin pending, so may
   actually be higher. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal
   failure with uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. She appears to
   be fully respiratorily compensated at present without any additional
   non-gap or respiratory process. Should she appear to tire or otherwise
   be unable to compensate, will need to consider intubation.
   -          Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   -          Checking albumin
   .
   #) Anemia: Appears hemo-concentrated at this time from recent baseline
   of 26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from
   [**12/2110**] with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: EKG demonstrated no findings concerning for acute
   ischemia. CK is flat. Tropinin markedly elevated, but in setting of
   prior elevated troponin (0.674 [**5-/2111**]) and renal insufficiency.
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   - Follow up EKG this AM
   - Continue [**Year (4 digits) 119**] 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation
   - Follow pulses
   - Follow up final CT read
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive:
   Per daughter, has had marked decline over the last several months,
   worsening over the last several days. Poor PO intake.
   Suspect this is multifactorial picture in setting of underlying
   dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) FEN:
   - IVF as noted above, bolusing as need to maintain MAP, following
   electrolytes.
   - Monitoring and repleting electrolytes as discussed above.
   - NPO for now
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin
   .
   #) Access: Currently has femoral triple lumen and one 20 gage
   peripheral
   - Femoral line will need to be resited to non-femoral site
   .
   #) Code:  Full--called daughter and updated her and discussed recent
   events. Per daughter, patient is full code. The family wished to hold
   off on intubation for purposes of the CT scan downstairs, but would
   want intubation if has respiratory decline. Daughter will come in very
   soon to talk about this further.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo F w/ MMM presents with:
          Septic shock
          Hypotension
          Leukocytosis
          AGMA (lactate and uremia)-->now NGMA
          Hypernatremia
          ARF on CRI
          NSTEMI/demand ischemia
          Altered mental status on underlying dementia
   Hypotension in setting of septic shock. Pt also with profound
   dehydration at presentation in setting of ongoing lasix and poor po
   intake/FTT further contributing.  Initially improving and weaned off
   pressors but now hypothermic and hypotensive with levophed restarted.
   OSH Bl cxs growing CPS (2 different sensies).   Still with sm to mod
   diarrhea.
   Agree with plan to treat for septic shock with aggressive IVFs,
   maintaining MAPS > 60 attempting to again wean off levophed.  Pt is
   unable to cooperate with CVL limiting our ability to follow cvp or svo2
   to further guide resus. Overnight her lactate normalized and cr has
   been decreasing.  Will continue to monitor abgs, ph, and lactate
   levels.  She now has a NGMA--from diarrhea and NS. Will use LR for
   IVFs. Will con't vanco, cefe and flagyl for now pending additional cx
   data. Her diarrhea is minimal but we will cover empirically for c diff
   and follow abd exam. She has been oxygenating well, with neg urine lg,
   lower suspicion for pna/atypical pna
can d/c azithro.  Will check TTE
   to assess for SBE and send surveillance cx given CNS bactermeia. Her na
   is improving and we continue to replete free water deficit.  ARF is
   likely multifactorial in etiology
prerenal from profound dehydration,
   onoging meds (lasix and lisinopri), low flow state in setting of known
   AS, as well as sepsis with probable ATN.  Cr and urine outpt
   responding to IVFs. Demand ichemia in setting of sepsis on admit, trop
   are now trending down. Continue asa. New CPK elevation, may suggest
   rhabdo. Continue hydration and trend.  AAA appears larger than prior,
   though without evidence of dissection or bleed by ct.  Follow pulses
   and serial hcts.  Clarify baseline MS, though at this time appears to
   be multiple potential causes for decline including sepsis, hypotension
   and hypernatremia on top of underlying dementia.
   Given her metabolic process, pt is at  high risk for fatiguing and
   being increasingly unable to compensate adequately for metabolic
   acidosis.  Given her agitation she is not a good candidate for NPPV.
   Pt is DNR, [**Name (NI) **].  Will continue current level of aggressive care and
   keep family updated and continue to address goals of care..   Social
   work consult.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Agree with plan to treat for septic shock with aggressive IVFs,
   maintaining MAPS > 60 attempting to again wean off levophed.  Pt is
   unable to cooperate with CVL limiting our ability to follow cvp or svo2
   to further guide resus. Overnight her lactate normalized and cr has
   been decreasing.  Will continue to monitor abgs, ph, and lactate
   levels.  She now has a NGMA--from diarrhea and NS. Will use LR for
   IVFs. Will con't vanco, cefe and flagyl for now pending additional cx
   data. Her diarrhea is minimal but we will cover empirically for c diff
   and follow abd exam. She has been oxygenating well, with neg urine lg,
   lower suspicion for pna/atypical pna
can d/c azithro.  Will check TTE
   to assess for SBE and send surveillance cx given CNS bactermeia. Her na
   is improving and we continue to replete free water deficit.  ARF is
   likely multifactorial in etiology
prerenal from profound dehydration,
   onoging meds (lasix and lisinopri), low flow state in setting of known
   AS, as well as sepsis with probable ATN.  Cr and urine outpt
   responding to IVFs. Demand ichemia in setting of sepsis on admit, trop
   are now trending down. Continue asa. New CPK elevation, may suggest
   rhabdo. Continue hydration and trend.  AAA appears larger than prior,
   though without evidence of dissection or bleed by ct.  Follow pulses
   and serial hcts.  Clarify baseline MS, though at this time appears to
   be multiple potential causes for decline including sepsis, hypotension
   and hypernatremia on top of underlying dementia.
   Given her metabolic process, pt is at  high risk for fatiguing and
   being increasingly unable to compensate adequately for metabolic
   acidosis.  Given her agitation she is not a good candidate for NPPV.
   Pt is DNR, [**Name (NI) **].  Will continue current level of aggressive care and

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of multiple myeloma (MMM) who presented with septic shock, hypotension, leukocytosis, acute kidney injury (AKI), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and altered mental status on underlying dementia.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 94 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 92/54 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient has a significant fluid imbalance, with a total fluid input of 6,848 mL and a total fluid output of 2,480 mL, resulting in a positive fluid balance of 4,368 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.5 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 148 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.6 mg/dL
* Troponin: 0.59 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.5 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.9 g/dL
* LDH: 512 IU/L
* Calcium: 6.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.9 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: Clear lungs
* Abdominal CT: AAA appears larger than prior, but without evidence of dissection or bleed

The patient's medical history is significant for MMM, NSTEMI, and dementia.

The patient's current medications include:

* Piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Cefipime
* Azithromycin
* Metronidazole
* Heparin sodium (prophylaxis)
* Insulin sliding scale

The patient's plan includes:

* Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mmHg
* Weaning off levophed as tolerated
* Monitoring of lactate levels and ABG results
* Continued treatment for septic shock with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole
* Monitoring of diarrhea and covering empirically for Clostridioides difficile (C. diff)
* Serial abdominal exams and stool cultures
* Palliative care consult and clergy visit with family

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued septic shock and organ dysfunction
* Acute kidney injury (AKI) and need for renal replacement therapy (RRT)
* Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and need for cardiac catheterization
* Dementia and altered mental status
* Fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance
* Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy
* Rhabdomyolysis
* Fatigue and decreased ability to compensate for metabolic acidosis
* Need for continued aggressive care and potential need for ICU transfer to a higher level of care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of dementia who presented with septic shock, hypotension, leukocytosis, acute kidney injury, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. She was treated with aggressive IV fluids, pressors, and antibiotics, and her lactate levels normalized. However, she continues to experience hypotension, hypothermia, and hypernatremia. Her blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus from her bladder catheter, and she has a history of diarrhea. She is unable to safely cooperate with central venous line placement, limiting the ability to check central venous pressure and mixed venous oxygen saturation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock has not fully resolved, and she continues to experience hypotension and hypothermia. There is a risk of further deterioration and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is likely multifactorial, with contributions from dehydration, medication use, and sepsis. Further decline in kidney function could lead to increased morbidity and mortality.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to dehydration and may worsen if not corrected. This could lead to cerebral edema and increased intracranial pressure.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently stable, but she may require further respiratory support if her condition deteriorates.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction is a risk factor for cardiac complications, including heart failure and arrhythmias.
6. Infection: The patient's positive blood cultures and history of diarrhea increase the risk of further infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
7. Dementia: The patient's underlying dementia may exacerbate her confusion and agitation, making it challenging to manage her care and communicate with her family.
8. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and decreased tissue perfusion increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which could lead to further complications and morbidity.

Given the patient's critical illness, it is essential to continue aggressive management of her septic shock, hypernatremia, and acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory values, and radiographic studies will be necessary to guide treatment and prevent further complications."

   Hypotension in setting of septic shock. Pt also with profound
   dehydration at presentation in setting of ongoing lasix and poor po
   intake/FTT further contributing.  Initially improving and weaned off
   pressors but now hypothermic and hypotensive with levophed restarted.
   OSH Bl cxs growing CPS (2 different sensies).   Still with sm to mod
   diarrhea.
   Agree with plan to treat for septic shock with aggressive IVFs,
   maintaining MAPS > 60 attempting to again wean off levophed.  Pt is
   unable to cooperate with CVL limiting our ability to follow cvp or svo2
   to further guide resus. Overnight her lactate normalized and cr has
   been decreasing.  Will continue to monitor abgs, ph, and lactate
   levels.  She now has a NGMA--from diarrhea and NS. Will use LR for
   IVFs. Will con't vanco, cefe and flagyl for now pending additional cx
   data. Her diarrhea is minimal but we will cover empirically for c diff
   and follow abd exam. She has been oxygenating well, with neg urine lg,
   lower suspicion for pna/atypical pna
can d/c azithro.  Will check TTE
   to assess for SBE and send surveillance cx given CNS bactermeia. Her na
   is improving and we continue to replete free water deficit.  ARF is
   likely multifactorial in etiology
prerenal from profound dehydration,
   onoging meds (lasix and lisinopri), low flow state in setting of known
   AS, as well as sepsis with probable ATN.  Cr and urine outpt
   responding to IVFs. Demand ichemia in setting of sepsis on admit, trop
   are now trending down. Continue asa. New CPK elevation, may suggest
   rhabdo. Continue hydration and trend.  AAA appears larger than prior,
   though without evidence of dissection or bleed by ct.  Follow pulses
   and serial hcts.  Clarify baseline MS, though at this time appears to
   be multiple potential causes for decline including sepsis, hypotension
   and hypernatremia on top of underlying dementia.
   Given her metabolic process, pt is at  high risk for fatiguing and
   being increasingly unable to compensate adequately for metabolic
   acidosis.  Given her agitation she is not a good candidate for NPPV.
   Pt is DNR, [**Name (NI) **].  Will continue current level of aggressive care and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of dementia who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, hypotension, leukocytosis, and altered mental status. She has been diagnosed with acute kidney injury (ARF) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with demand ischemia. She has also been experiencing diarrhea, hypernatremia, and profound dehydration. The patient's condition has been improving initially, but she has now developed recurrent hypotension and hypothermia, requiring the restart of pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock and ARF are likely related to her underlying infection, and she may continue to experience organ dysfunction if not properly treated.
2. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's ARF is likely multifactorial, including prerenal from dehydration, ongoing medications (lasix and lisinopril), low flow state, and sepsis, which may increase her risk of developing ATN.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's new CPK elevation may indicate rhabdomyolysis, which can be a complication of sepsis and dehydration.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's NSTEMI and demand ischemia may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's hypernatremia and dehydration may lead to metabolic acidosis, which can worsen her condition if not properly treated.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's altered mental status and inability to cooperate with non-invasive ventilation (NPPV) may increase her risk of respiratory failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and dementia may increase her risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or cerebral edema.

Recommendations:

1. Continue aggressive IV fluid resuscitation to maintain MAP > 60 and wean off pressors.
2. Monitor the patient's lactate and creatinine levels to assess the effectiveness of treatment.
3. Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy pending additional culture data.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and replete free water deficit.
5. Continue to assess the patient's cardiac function and consider further cardiac evaluation.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
7. Consider a social work consult to address the patient's goals of care and ensure that the patient's family is informed and involved in decision-making.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's condition and potential complications, and further evaluation and treatment are necessary to address the patient's specific needs."

   ECHO this morning
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock,
   hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
   pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear
   where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here still
   pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due to
   staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is sat-ing well on
   NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc (Day 3), cefepime (Day 3), and flagyl
   - vanc levels after 3^rd dose of vanc
   - consider cipro for GNR coverage in case of UTI
   - discontinued azithromycin yesterday as pt does not seem to have lung
   infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - wait for 3x C. Diff; if negative, d/c flagyl
   - Follow lactate
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - f/u with ECHO results to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved.  The most likely etiology is hypovolemic.
   - Follow up pm sodium
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr 1.6. Per
   notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5. Etiologies include pre-renal and
   ATN in the setting of severe volume depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration prn
   - continue to monitor creatinine daily
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today. Albumin 2.9.
   Multifactorial etiology including IVF she received, as well as diarrhea
   which is slowing down. The anion gap is closing as uremia and lactic
   acidosis improving.
   - Follow up ABGs daily
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Trending down. Unclear etiology but it is non-cardiac.
   Might be due to lying in bed without moving around chronically. TSH
   normal, so unlikely due to hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multi-factorial picture in
   setting of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable
   infection.
   - ABGs regularly to assess ventilatory status
   - discuss with family re NGT feeds.
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - update family and discuss with daughter
   - f/u palliative care recs
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. Start to consider long-term feeding options.
   Will talk to family re NGT.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Disposition: ICU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock, hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's acid-base status is compromised, with a pH of 7.15 and an anion gap of 10.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and fatigue can lead to worsening respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and anemia can increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal insufficiency can worsen, leading to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap is closing, but further monitoring is necessary to ensure that the acid-base status improves.
5. Infection: The patient's septic shock and bacteremia can lead to further infections, such as pneumonia or UTI.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's diarrhea and C. diff negative status can lead to further gastrointestinal complications, such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen, leading to further cardiovascular complications.
8. Mental status changes: The patient's poor PO intake and suspected underlying dementia can lead to further mental status changes, such as delirium or confusion.
9. Failure to thrive: The patient's poor PO intake and suspected underlying dementia can lead to further decline in her overall condition.

The patient's goals of care include updating the family and discussing long-term feeding options, as well as considering palliative care recommendations. The patient's disposition is currently ICU, and she is being managed with IVF boluses, levophed, and vasopressin as needed."

   effusion, wedge-shaped consolidation in the right middle lobe?
   ECHO this morning
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock,
   hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
   pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear
   where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here still
   pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due to
   staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is sat-ing well on
   NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc (Day 3), cefepime (Day 3), and flagyl
   - discontinued azithromycin yesterday as pt does not seem to have lung
   infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - wait for 3x C. Diff; if negative, d/c flagyl
   - Follow lactate
   - Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible, would
   ideally check CVP but difficult with femoral CVL
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - f/u with ECHO results to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved.  The most likely etiology is hypovolemic.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given likely
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - D5W at 100cc / hr for 28 hours (to get Na down to 140)
   - Follow up pm sodium
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr went
   down from 3.0 to 2.0. Per notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5.
   Etiologies include pre-renal and ATN in the setting of severe volume
   depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today, down from 13 yesterday.
   Albumin 2.9. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal failure with
   uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. Uremia and lactic acidosis
   improving. She appears to not be able to fully compensate at a
   respiratory standpoint at present with additional non-gap process.
   Should she appear to tire or otherwise be unable to compensate, will
   need to consider intubation. However, pt is DNR and DNI.
   - Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Unclear etiology. Non-cardiac. Might be due to lying in
   bed without moving around chronically. TSH normal, so unlikely due to
   hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multi-factorial picture in
   setting of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable
   infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - update family and discuss with daughter
   ICU [**Name2 (NI) 151**]
   Nutrition: NPO for now. Start to consider long-term feeding options.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock,
   hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
   pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear
   where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here still
   pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due to
   staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is sat-ing well on
   NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc (Day 3), cefepime (Day 3), and flagyl
   - discontinued azithromycin yesterday as pt does not seem to have lung
   infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - wait for 3x C. Diff; if negative, d/c flagyl
   - Follow lactate
   - Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible, would
   ideally check CVP but difficult with femoral CVL
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - f/u with ECHO results to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved.  The most likely etiology is hypovolemic.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given likely
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - D5W at 100cc / hr for 28 hours (to get Na down to 140)
   - Follow up pm sodium
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr went
   down from 3.0 to 2.0. Per notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5.
   Etiologies include pre-renal and ATN in the setting of severe volume
   depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today, down from 13 yesterday.
   Albumin 2.9. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal failure with
   uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. Uremia and lactic acidosis
   improving. She appears to not be able to fully compensate at a
   respiratory standpoint at present with additional non-gap process.
   Should she appear to tire or otherwise be unable to compensate, will
   need to consider intubation. However, pt is DNR and DNI.
   - Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Unclear etiology. Non-cardiac. Might be due to lying in
   bed without moving around chronically. TSH normal, so unlikely due to
   hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multi-factorial picture in
   setting of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable
   infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - update family and discuss with daughter
   ICU [**Name2 (NI) 151**]
   Nutrition: NPO for now. Start to consider long-term feeding options.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's condition has been stabilized, but there are several potential medical complications that may arise.

1. Respiratory acidosis: The patient's pH level is 7.22, which is below the normal range of 7.35-7.45. This may be due to the patient's underlying chronic respiratory disease, as well as the respiratory acidosis caused by the septic shock.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap is 10, which is within the normal range. However, the patient's serum bicarbonate level is low, which may indicate metabolic acidosis. This may be due to the patient's underlying chronic kidney disease, as well as the metabolic acidosis caused by the septic shock.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.1 g/dL, which is below the normal range of 12-16 g/dL. This may be due to the patient's underlying chronic kidney disease, as well as the anemia caused by the septic shock.
4. Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin level is 0.44 ng/mL, which is above the normal range of 0.01-0.1 ng/mL. This may be due to the patient's underlying cardiac disease, as well as the demand ischemia caused by the septic shock.
5. AAA: The patient's abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is 7 cm in diameter, which is above the normal range of 4-6 cm. This may be contributing to the patient's poor PO intake and renal insufficiency.
6. Mental status/Failure to thrive: The patient's mental status has declined over the last several months, and the patient is unable to thrive due to the underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection.
7. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and a blood culture that is pending. The patient may also have a pulmonary source of infection, as the CXR shows bibasilar opacity consistent with pleural effusion and wedge-shaped consolidation in the right middle lobe.

Based on the patient's condition, the following potential medical complications may arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory acidosis and metabolic acidosis may lead to respiratory failure, which may require intubation.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's elevated troponin level and anemia may lead to cardiac failure, which may require cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen, which may require dialysis.
4. Infection: The patient's UTI and pending blood culture may lead to sepsis, which may require antibiotics and other treatments.
5. AAA rupture: The patient's AAA may rupture, which may require emergency surgery.
6. Mental status decline: The patient's mental status may continue to decline, which may require further evaluation and treatment.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including respiratory failure, cardiac failure, renal failure, infection, AAA rupture, and mental status decline. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent these complications and improve the patient's outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock
   , hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsisNeedham
   blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
   pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear
   where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here still
   pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due to
   staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is satting well on
   NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc and cefepime
   - discontinue azithromycin as pt does not seem to have lung infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - Follow lactate
   -  Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible, would
   ideally check CVP but difficult with femoral CVL
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - consider ECHO to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Improving with IVF. The most likely etiology is
   hypovolemic. She continues to have free water deficit of 3.3 liter
   today.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given likely
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - D5W at 100cc / hr for 28 hours (to get Na down to 140)
   - Follow up pm sodium
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr went
   down from 3.0 to 2.0. Per notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5.
   Etiologies include pre-renal and ATN in the setting of severe volume
   depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today, down from 13 yesterday.
   Albumin 2.9. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal failure with
   uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. Uremia and lactic acidosis
   improving. She appears to be fully respiratorily compensated at present
   without any additional non-gap or respiratory process. Should she
   appear to tire or otherwise be unable to compensate, will need to
   consider intubation. However, pt is DNR and DNI.
   - Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Unclear etiology. Non-cardiac. Might be due to lying in
   bed withoug moving around chronically. TSH normal, so unlikely due to
   hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multifactorial picture in setting
   of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - update family and discuss with daughter
   ICU [**Name2 (NI) 151**]

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 87-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU with septic shock, hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has a complex medical history and is currently receiving multiple medications, including vasopressors, antibiotics, and diuretics.

The patient's acid-base status is abnormal, with a pH of 7.22 and a base excess of -10. This suggests that the patient is in metabolic acidosis, which is likely due to a combination of factors including acute renal failure, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis.

The patient's respiratory status is also abnormal, with a partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 40 mmHg and a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 118 mmHg. This suggests that the patient has respiratory acidosis, which is likely due to the patient's underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV).

The patient's cardiovascular status is also abnormal, with a blood pressure of 95/55 mmHg and a heart rate of 95 beats per minute. This suggests that the patient has hypotension, which is likely due to the patient's underlying septic shock and the use of vasopressors.

The patient's renal status is also abnormal, with a creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 17 mg/dL. This suggests that the patient has acute kidney injury (AKI), which is likely due to the patient's underlying septic shock and the use of diuretics.

The patient's nutritional status is also abnormal, with a total parenteral nutrition (TPN) order in place. This suggests that the patient is malnourished, which is likely due to the patient's underlying chronic illness and the use of TPN.

The patient's mental status is also abnormal, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 10. This suggests that the patient has a severe neurological disorder, which is likely due to the patient's underlying chronic illness and the use of sedatives.

The patient's social situation is also complex, with a daughter who is the patient's primary caregiver. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, which suggests that the patient does not want to receive life-sustaining treatments.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current status, the patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Septic shock: The patient is at risk for further deterioration due to the patient's underlying chronic illness and the use of vasopressors.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient is at risk for further worsening of hypernatremia due to the patient's underlying chronic illness and the use of diuretics.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient is at risk for further worsening of AKI due to the patient's underlying chronic illness and the use of diuretics.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for further worsening of respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying chronic illness and the use of NIPPV.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient is at risk for further worsening of cardiovascular instability due to the patient's underlying chronic illness and the use of vasopressors.
6. Neurological deterioration: The patient is at risk for further worsening of neurological deterioration due to the patient's underlying chronic illness and the use of sedatives.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infection due to the patient's underlying chronic illness and the use of antibiotics.
8. Malnutrition: The patient is at risk for further malnutrition due to the patient's underlying chronic illness and the use of TPN.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current status, the patient's potential medical complications require close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock,
   hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
   pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear
   where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here still
   pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due to
   staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is sat-ing well on
   NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc (Day 3), cefepime (Day 3), and flagyl
   - vanc levels after 3^rd dose of vanc
   - discontinued azithromycin yesterday as pt does not seem to have lung
   infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - wait for 3x C. Diff; if negative, d/c flagyl
   - Follow lactate
   - Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible, would
   ideally check CVP but difficult with femoral CVL
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - f/u with ECHO results to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved.  The most likely etiology is hypovolemic.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given likely
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - D5W at 100cc / hr for 28 hours (to get Na down to 140)
   - Follow up pm sodium
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr went
   down from 3.0 to 2.0. Per notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5.
   Etiologies include pre-renal and ATN in the setting of severe volume
   depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today, down from 13 yesterday.
   Albumin 2.9. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal failure with
   uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. Uremia and lactic acidosis
   improving. She appears to not be able to fully compensate at a
   respiratory standpoint at present with additional non-gap process.
   Should she appear to tire or otherwise be unable to compensate, will
   need to consider intubation. However, pt is DNR and DNI.
   - Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Unclear etiology. Non-cardiac. Might be due to lying in
   bed without moving around chronically. TSH normal, so unlikely due to
   hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multi-factorial picture in
   setting of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable
   infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - update family and discuss with daughter
   ICU [**Name2 (NI) 151**]
   Nutrition: NPO for now. Start to consider long-term feeding options.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock,
   hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
   pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear
   where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here still
   pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due to
   staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is sat-ing well on
   NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc (Day 3), cefepime (Day 3), and flagyl
   - vanc levels after 3^rd dose of vanc
   - discontinued azithromycin yesterday as pt does not seem to have lung
   infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - wait for 3x C. Diff; if negative, d/c flagyl
   - Follow lactate
   - Will need to replace CVL to non-femoral site when possible, would
   ideally check CVP but difficult with femoral CVL
   - Check venous saturation once have neck/subclavian line
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - f/u with ECHO results to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved.  The most likely etiology is hypovolemic.
   - Goal correction is 0.5 mEq/hour ([**9-14**] mEq/day) given likely
   chronicity of hypernatremia
   - D5W at 100cc / hr for 28 hours (to get Na down to 140)
   - Follow up pm sodium
   - Check serum and urine Osm, urine electrolytes
   - Will use NaCl to concurrently expand intravascular volume, once
   volume repleted, would switch over to 1/2 NS or D5W
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr went
   down from 3.0 to 2.0. Per notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5.
   Etiologies include pre-renal and ATN in the setting of severe volume
   depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration
   - Follow trend
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today, down from 13 yesterday.
   Albumin 2.9. Multifactorial etiology including acute renal failure with
   uremia, new diarrhea, and lactic acidosis. Uremia and lactic acidosis
   improving. She appears to not be able to fully compensate at a
   respiratory standpoint at present with additional non-gap process.
   Should she appear to tire or otherwise be unable to compensate, will
   need to consider intubation. However, pt is DNR and DNI.
   - Follow up ABGs, work on reversing underlying processes
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Unclear etiology. Non-cardiac. Might be due to lying in
   bed without moving around chronically. TSH normal, so unlikely due to
   hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multi-factorial picture in
   setting of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable
   infection.
   - Continue to work above concerns
   - Social work consult
   - Need to discuss with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 508**] work-up, get sense of goals of
   care, etc
   - Hold off on LP or head CT at present given large number of likely
   contributing factors as noted above
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - update family and discuss with daughter
   ICU [**Name2 (NI) 151**]

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is an 87-year-old female with a history of septic shock, hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
* She is currently receiving vasopressors and IV fluids to maintain blood pressure and urine output.
* Her respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 95% and no signs of respiratory distress.
* Her neurological status is also stable, with the ability to open her eyes and move her extremities.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* **Septic Shock:** The patient's septic shock is being managed with vasopressors and IV fluids, but there is a risk of recurrent septic shock if the underlying infection is not adequately treated.
* **Hypernatremia:** The patient's hypernatremia has resolved, but there is a risk of developing hyponatremia if the IV fluids are not managed carefully.
* **Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency:** The patient's renal function is improving, but there is a risk of further deterioration if the underlying causes of the kidney injury are not addressed.
* **Metabolic Acidosis:** The patient's metabolic acidosis is being managed with IV fluids and respiratory support, but there is a risk of worsening acidosis if the underlying causes are not addressed.
* **Anemia:** The patient's anemia is being managed with iron supplementation and blood transfusions, but there is a risk of further anemia if the underlying causes are not addressed.
* **Elevated Troponin:** The patient's elevated troponin levels are likely secondary to demand ischemia, but there is a risk of further cardiac injury if the underlying causes are not addressed.
* **AAA:** The patient's AAA is being monitored, but there is a risk of rupture if the underlying causes are not addressed.
* **Elevated CK:** The patient's elevated CK levels are unclear, but there is a risk of further muscle damage if the underlying causes are not addressed.
* **Mental Status/Failure to Thrive:** The patient's mental status and failure to thrive are multifactorial, but there is a risk of further decline if the underlying causes are not addressed.

**Plan:**

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results to assess the effectiveness of treatment.
* Continue to manage the patient's septic shock, hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal insufficiency with vasopressors and IV fluids.
* Continue to manage the patient's metabolic acidosis with IV fluids and respiratory support.
* Continue to manage the patient's anemia with iron supplementation and blood transfusions.
* Continue to monitor the patient's AAA and consider further evaluation if necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's elevated CK levels and consider further evaluation if necessary.
* Consider a social work consult to discuss the patient's goals of care and consider long-term feeding options.
* Hold off on LP or head CT at present given the large number of likely contributing factors."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

She was initially hypotensive and required pressors, but has since been weaned off them with improving renal function and blood pH. The patient's lactate levels have normalized, and her respiratory acidosis has improved with better respiratory compensation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 8.7-9.5 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 30.4-32.7%
* Platelet count: 108-132 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.1-2.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.44-0.37 ng/mL
* TCO2: 15-17 mmHg
* Glucose: 147-152 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, Differential-Neuts, Lactic Acid, Albumin, LDH, Ca++, Mg++, PO4

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CXR: Very rotated, possible atelectasis vs. vascular structure at RU zone, full hilar vessels with small lung volume, and large gastric bubble

The patient's microbiology results show:

* Urine culture pending
* Bladder culture: OSH Bl + 2 species, CNS: OSH Bl + 2 species
* C. diff negative x 1

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Septic shock (resolved)
* Hypotension (resolved)
* Leukocytosis
* AGMA (lactate and uremia) -> now NGMA
* Hypernatremia
* ARF on CRI (improved)
* NSTEMI/demand ischemia
* Altered mental status on underlying dementia

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Dehydration
* Renal failure
* Metabolic acidosis
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiovascular instability
* Neurological deterioration
* Gastrointestinal complications (diarrhea, constipation)
* Infection-related complications (UTI, pneumonia)
* Thrombotic complications (DVT, PE)

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continued empiric cefepime for 3 days
* Vancomycin for 3 days for CNS bacteremia
* Flagyl pending additional negative C. diff results
* IV fluids as needed
* Monitoring for SBE and sending surveillance cultures
* Adjusting medication dosing as needed
* Serial HCTs and follow-up official CXR read
* Reassessing for ability to tolerate NPPV
* Social work consult

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo F w/ MMM presents with:
          Septic shock (now off pressors)
          Hypotension (resolved)
          Leukocytosis
          AGMA (lactate and uremia)-->now NGMA
          Hypernatremia
          ARF on CRI (improved)
          NSTEMI/demand ischemia
          Altered mental status on underlying dementia
              AAA
   Hypotension in setting of septic shock. Pt also with profound
   dehydration at presentation in setting of ongoing lasix and poor po
   intake/FTT further contributing. She is now off pessors with improving
   renal fx, urine outpt and blood ph.  OSH Bl cxs growing CPS (2
   different sensies).   Still with sm to mod diarrhea.  Infection source
   remains unclear
? Pna, urine, SBE.  C diff neg to date.
   Agree with plan to continue vanco (day 3) for cns bacteremia, follow
   levels.  Will continue flagyl, pending 1 additional neg c diff given
   diarrhea, and empiric cefepime (day 3) for now given shock, but if cx
   continue to show no GN growth, would d/c tomorrow. F/u TTE read and
   surveillance cx
s, as concern for SBE as potential source.
   Her lactate has normalized, we continue to follow abg for blood ph.
   She is off pressors with MAPS holding > 60.   She continues to have a
   NGMA--from diarrhea and NS resus but is nearly fully compensating from
   resp standpoint.  Will use LR for IVFs as needed.
   We have corrected her free water def icit and na now wnl.
    ARF has improved with adequate urine outpt
will adjust med dosing
   accordingly.
   MS improving to baseline per family. Multiple potential causes for
   decline including sepsis, hypotension and hypernatremia on top of
   underlying dementia.  Continue to monitor closely and follow for signs
   of CO2 retention.  Reassess for ability to tolerate NPPV if fatigues.
   Her CXR looks more wet, but she continues to oxygenate well at this
   time. Consider diuresis down the line if BP remain adequate.
   Discuss NGT with family, as they declined this yesterday.  If pt
   continues to improve, issue of long term feeding will also be issue.
   Pt is DNR, [**Name (NI) **].  Will continue current level of aggressive care and
   keep family updated and continue to address goals of care..   Social
   work and palliative care input appreciated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female with multiple myeloma and septic shock, who has been improving but still has several medical complications. She was previously hypotensive and required pressors, but is now off pressors with a MAP > 60. Her lactate has normalized, and her respiratory status has improved, but she still has moderate diarrhea. Her hypernatremia has been corrected, and her acute renal failure (ARF) has improved with adequate urine output. She has a NGMA due to diarrhea and NS resuscitation, but is nearly fully compensating from a respiratory standpoint.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock has improved, but she is still at risk for further complications, such as organ dysfunction or failure.
2. Infection: The patient's infection source remains unclear, and she has multiple species of bacteria growing in her blood cultures. She is at risk for further infections, particularly in her central nervous system (CNS).
3. Hypernatremia: Although the patient's hypernatremia has been corrected, she is still at risk for further electrolyte imbalances, particularly in her sodium levels.
4. ARF: The patient's ARF has improved, but she is still at risk for further kidney damage or failure.
5. NSTEMI/demand ischemia: The patient's NSTEMI/demand ischemia has improved, but she is still at risk for further cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
6. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to her underlying dementia, but she may also be experiencing delirium or encephalopathy due to her sepsis or other medical complications.
7. DVT: The patient is at risk for developing a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to her prolonged immobility and her underlying medical conditions.
8. VAP: The patient is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to her prolonged mechanical ventilation.
9. SBE: The patient's central line is at risk for causing a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), which could lead to sepsis and other complications.
10. CO2 retention: The patient may be at risk for developing CO2 retention due to her respiratory status and her underlying medical conditions."

   IMAGING:
   TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No discrete
   vegetation is seen (does not exclude). There is mild aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No discrete vegetation is
   seen (does not exclude). Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis.
   Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
   biventricular systolic function.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a discrete vegetation on
   transthoracic echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
   .
   CXR from today: my read:
   .
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock,
   hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
   pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear
   where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here still
   pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due to
   staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is sat-ing well on
   NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc (Day 3), cefepime (Day 3), and flagyl
   - vanc levels after 3^rd dose of vanc
   - consider cipro for GNR coverage in case of UTI
   - discontinued azithromycin yesterday as pt does not seem to have lung
   infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - wait for 3x C. Diff; if negative, d/c flagyl
   - Follow lactate
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - f/u with ECHO results to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved.  The most likely etiology is hypovolemic.
   - Follow up pm sodium
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr 1.6. Per
   notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5. Etiologies include pre-renal and
   ATN in the setting of severe volume depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration prn
   - continue to monitor creatinine daily
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today. Albumin 2.9.
   Multifactorial etiology including IVF she received, as well as diarrhea
   which is slowing down. The anion gap is closing as uremia and lactic
   acidosis improving.
   - Follow up ABGs daily
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Trending down. Unclear etiology but it is non-cardiac.
   Might be due to lying in bed without moving around chronically. TSH
   normal, so unlikely due to hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multi-factorial picture in
   setting of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable
   infection.
   - ABGs regularly to assess ventilatory status
   - discuss with family re NGT feeds.
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - update family and discuss with daughter
   - f/u palliative care recs
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. Start to consider long-term feeding options.
   Will talk to family re NGT.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   IMAGING:
   TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No discrete
   vegetation is seen (does not exclude). There is mild aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No discrete vegetation is
   seen (does not exclude). Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis.
   Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
   biventricular systolic function.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a discrete vegetation on
   transthoracic echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

   CXR from today: my read:
   .
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock,
   hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
   pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear
   where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here still
   pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due to
   staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is sat-ing well on
   NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc (Day 3), cefepime (Day 3), and flagyl
   - vanc levels after 3^rd dose of vanc
   - consider cipro for GNR coverage in case of UTI
   - discontinued azithromycin yesterday as pt does not seem to have lung
   infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - wait for 3x C. Diff; if negative, d/c flagyl
   - Follow lactate
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - f/u with ECHO results to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved.  The most likely etiology is hypovolemic.
   - Follow up pm sodium
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr 1.6. Per
   notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5. Etiologies include pre-renal and
   ATN in the setting of severe volume depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration prn
   - continue to monitor creatinine daily
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today. Albumin 2.9.
   Multifactorial etiology including IVF she received, as well as diarrhea
   which is slowing down. The anion gap is closing as uremia and lactic
   acidosis improving.
   - Follow up ABGs daily
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Trending down. Unclear etiology but it is non-cardiac.
   Might be due to lying in bed without moving around chronically. TSH
   normal, so unlikely due to hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multi-factorial picture in
   setting of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable
   infection.
   - ABGs regularly to assess ventilatory status
   - discuss with family re NGT feeds.
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - update family and discuss with daughter
   - f/u palliative care recs
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. Start to consider long-term feeding options.
   Will talk to family re NGT.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   IMAGING:
   TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No discrete
   vegetation is seen (does not exclude). There is mild aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No discrete vegetation is
   seen (does not exclude). Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis.
   Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
   biventricular systolic function.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a discrete vegetation on
   transthoracic echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

   CXR from today: my read:
   .
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock,
   hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
   pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear
   where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here still
   pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due to
   staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is sat-ing well on
   NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.  Echo showed no evidence of endocarditis.
   - Discontinue levophed and vasopressin
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - Discontinue vanc (Day 3), cefepime (Day 3), and flagyl
   - Switch to levaquin 250mg qd PO for plan of 5 day course
   - Wait for 3x C. Diff; if negative
   - Follow lactate
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr 1.6. Per
   notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5. Etiologies include pre-renal and
   ATN in the setting of severe volume depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration prn
   - Continue to monitor creatinine daily
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today. Albumin 2.9.
   Multifactorial etiology including IVF she received, as well as diarrhea
   which is slowing down. The anion gap is closing as uremia and lactic
   acidosis improving.
   - Follow up ABGs daily
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Meet with family concerning hospice care and goals of care
   - Continue to check peripheral pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Trending down. Unclear etiology but it is non-cardiac.
   Might be due to lying in bed without moving around chronically. TSH
   normal, so unlikely due to hypothyroidism.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multi-factorial picture in
   setting of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable
   infection.  Family doesn
t want NGT placed.
   - Ice chips and mouth care
   - ABGs regularly to assess ventilatory status
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - Update family and discuss with daughter
   - F/u palliative care recs
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. Start to consider long-term feeding options.
   Will talk to family re NGT.

   IMAGING:
   TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No discrete
   vegetation is seen (does not exclude). There is mild aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No discrete vegetation is
   seen (does not exclude). Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis.
   Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
   biventricular systolic function.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a discrete vegetation on
   transthoracic echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
   .
   CXR from today: my read: essentially unchanged from yesterday.
   .
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock,
   hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Resolved.  Afebrile, non-hypothermic. Pt is off
   pressor, and she is hemodynamically stable. [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from
   [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**] pansensitive,
 resistant
   to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear where the source is for
   this bacteremia. The cultures here still pending. Urinary source is
   possible, but usually UTI is not due to staph.  Pulmonary source are
   also possible, but pt is sat-ing well on NC oxygen supplementation, and
   CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella negative.  Echo showed no evidence
   of endocarditis.
   - Switch abx to levaquin 250mg qd PO for plan of 5 day course
   - send another c. diff test, currently c. diff neg x 2
   - d/c femoral CVL
   - Follow lactate
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr 1.6. Per
   notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5. Etiologies include pre-renal and
   ATN in the setting of severe volume depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration prn
   - Continue to monitor creatinine daily
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today. Albumin 2.9.
   Multifactorial etiology including IVF she received, as well as diarrhea
   which has resolved. The anion gap is closing as uremia and lactic
   acidosis resolved.
   - Follow up ABGs daily
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: most likely secondary to demand ischemia in the
   setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Meet with family concerning hospice care and goals of care
   - Continue to check peripheral pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Trending down. Unclear etiology but it is non-cardiac.
   Might be due to lying in bed without moving around chronically. TSH
   normal, so unlikely due to hypothyroidism.
   - Continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multi-factorial picture in
   setting of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable
   infection.  Family doesn
t want NGT placed.
   - NPO, family does not want NGT.
   -  Ice chips and mouth care
   - ABGs regularly to assess ventilatory status
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - Update family and discuss with daughter
   - F/u palliative care recs
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. Start to consider long-term feeding options.
   Family does not want NGT. Ice chips and mouth care

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Septic shock: Resolved
* Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: Improving with IVF
* Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today, with multifactorial etiology
* Anemia: Hct stable at 30.4%
* Elevated troponin: Most likely secondary to demand ischemia
* AAA: Enlarged to 7 cm, with no clear RP bleed or extravasation on CT scan
* Elevated CK: Trending down, unclear etiology

The patient's goals of care include:

* Update family and discuss with daughter
* F/u palliative care recs
* Consider long-term feeding options

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued deterioration of renal function
* Development of acute kidney injury
* Progression of metabolic acidosis
* Increased risk of cardiovascular events due to elevated troponin and hypertension
* Complications related to AAA, such as rupture or dissection
* Further decline in mental status and failure to thrive
* Increased risk of hospital-acquired infections, particularly in the setting of prolonged ICU stay and immunosuppression."

   MICRO:
   daily blood culture: NGTD
   urine culture: yeast
   C. diff neg x 2
   .
   IMAGING:
   TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No discrete
   vegetation is seen (does not exclude). There is mild aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No discrete vegetation is
   seen (does not exclude). Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis.
   Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
   biventricular systolic function.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a discrete vegetation on
   transthoracic echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.
   .
   CXR from today: my read:
   .
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock,
   hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
   pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear
   where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here still
   pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due to
   staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is sat-ing well on
   NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc (Day 3), cefepime (Day 3), and flagyl
   - vanc levels after 3^rd dose of vanc
   - consider cipro for GNR coverage in case of UTI
   - discontinued azithromycin yesterday as pt does not seem to have lung
   infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - wait for 3x C. Diff; if negative, d/c flagyl
   - Follow lactate
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - f/u with ECHO results to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved.  The most likely etiology is hypovolemic.
   - Follow up pm sodium
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr 1.6. Per
   notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5. Etiologies include pre-renal and
   ATN in the setting of severe volume depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration prn
   - continue to monitor creatinine daily
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today. Albumin 2.9.
   Multifactorial etiology including IVF she received, as well as diarrhea
   which is slowing down. The anion gap is closing as uremia and lactic
   acidosis improving.
   - Follow up ABGs daily
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Trending down. Unclear etiology but it is non-cardiac.
   Might be due to lying in bed without moving around chronically. TSH
   normal, so unlikely due to hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multi-factorial picture in
   setting of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable
   infection.
   - ABGs regularly to assess ventilatory status
   - discuss with family re NGT feeds.
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - update family and discuss with daughter
   - f/u palliative care recs
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. Start to consider long-term feeding options.
   Will talk to family re NGT.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   IMAGING:
   TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler
   imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. No discrete
   vegetation is seen (does not exclude). There is mild aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No discrete vegetation is
   seen (does not exclude). Mild to moderate ([**12-5**]+) mitral regurgitation
   is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild aortic stenosis.
   Moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
   biventricular systolic function.
   If clinically suggested, the absence of a discrete vegetation on
   transthoracic echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8665**] is an 87 year old female who presented with septic shock,
   hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #) Septic shock:  Patient fits criteria for diagnosis of sepsis.
   [**Location (un) 3**] blood culture from [**8-4**] grew coag negative staph, 2 species ([**1-7**]
   pansensitive,
 resistant to quinolones and cefazolin). It is unclear
   where the source is for this bacteremia. The cultures here still
   pending. Urinary source is possible, but usually UTI is not due to
   staph.  Pulmonary source are also possible, but pt is sat-ing well on
   NC oxygen supplementation, and CXR unremarkable.  Urine legionella
   negative.
   - Continue levophed for MAP >65, add vasopressin if needed
   - IVF boluses to maintain urine output at goal, watching lung
   examination closely (currently overall clear). Would use 1/2NS instead
   of NS for volume expansion given hypernatremia
   - continue vanc (Day 3), cefepime (Day 3), and flagyl
   - vanc levels after 3^rd dose of vanc
   - consider cipro for GNR coverage in case of UTI
   - discontinued azithromycin yesterday as pt does not seem to have lung
   infections
   - Given profuse diarrhea, checking c. diff (though seems less likely in
   setting of constipation), empiric flagyl for now
   - wait for 3x C. Diff; if negative, d/c flagyl
   - Follow lactate
   - Follow up culture data from here
   - Repeat CXR daily
   - f/u with ECHO results to r/o endocarditis
   .
   #) Hypernatremia: Resolved.  The most likely etiology is hypovolemic.
   - Follow up pm sodium
   .
   #) Acute on chronic renal insufficieny: Improving with IVF, Cr 1.6. Per
   notes, baseline creatinine around 1.5. Etiologies include pre-renal and
   ATN in the setting of severe volume depletion.
   - Holding antihypertensives in setting of hypotension, elevated
   creatinine
   - Continue hydration prn
   - continue to monitor creatinine daily
   .
   #) Metabolic acidosis: Anion gap of 10 today. Albumin 2.9.
   Multifactorial etiology including IVF she received, as well as diarrhea
   which is slowing down. The anion gap is closing as uremia and lactic
   acidosis improving.
   - Follow up ABGs daily
   .
   #) Anemia: Hct stable currently at 30.4 today.   Recent baseline of
   26-29 during admission in 6/[**2110**]. She has had iron studies from [**12/2110**]
   with iron 47, TIBC 193, ferritin 206, B12 181, folate >20
   - Follow trend, active type and cross
   - Obtain further information from PCP in regards to baseline, work-up
   .
   #) Elevated troponin: troponin trending down, most likely secondary to
   demand ischemia in the setting of severe volume depletion and anemia.
   - No need to trend cardiac enzymes now since troponin has peaked
   - Continue ASA 325 mg
   .
   #) AAA: Noted to have enlarged to 7 cm (last imaging in our system was
   [**2105**] at which time it was 4.6 x 4.0 cm), no clear RP bleed or
   extravagestion on CT scan; appears to be infrarenal without evidence of
   any dissection (however non-contrast). This could be contributing,
   however, to her poor PO intake and even renal insufficiency.
   - Will need vascular consultation post-ICU followup
   - Follow pulses
   .
   #) Elevated CK: Trending down. Unclear etiology but it is non-cardiac.
   Might be due to lying in bed without moving around chronically. TSH
   normal, so unlikely due to hypothyroidism.
   - continue to trend
   .
   #) Mental status/Failure to thrive: Per daughter, has had marked
   decline over the last several months, worsening over the last several
   days. Poor PO intake. Suspect this is multi-factorial picture in
   setting of underlying dementia, hypernatremia, uremia, and probable
   infection.
   - ABGs regularly to assess ventilatory status
   - discuss with family re NGT feeds.
   .
   #) Goals of care:
   - update family and discuss with daughter
   - f/u palliative care recs
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now. Start to consider long-term feeding options.
   Will talk to family re NGT.

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock, hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure. She has a history of dementia and is currently experiencing poor PO intake, which is likely contributing to her poor nutritional status. Her laboratory results show mild-moderate mitral regurgitation, mild aortic stenosis, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. She has a positive blood culture for coag-negative Staphylococcus, and her urine culture shows yeast. She is receiving treatment for sepsis, including antibiotics and vasopressors.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Endocarditis: Given the patient's history of bacteremia and the presence of vegetations on her mitral valve, there is a risk of endocarditis. Further echocardiography and blood cultures are needed to confirm or rule out this diagnosis.
2. Sepsis: The patient is currently receiving treatment for sepsis, but there is a risk of ongoing sepsis and the development of septic shock.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration in her renal function.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has hypernatremia, which may lead to complications such as seizures, coma, and death.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be contributing to her poor nutritional status and may require further evaluation and treatment.
6. Mental status changes: The patient has a history of dementia and is currently experiencing poor PO intake, which may be contributing to her poor mental status. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary to address this issue.
7. Pulmonary complications: The patient has moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, which may lead to complications such as pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient has mild-moderate mitral regurgitation and mild aortic stenosis, which may lead to complications such as heart failure and arrhythmias.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to assess for any changes in her condition.
2. Consider further evaluation and treatment for endocarditis, including echocardiography and blood cultures.
3. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis, including antibiotics and vasopressors.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider further treatment if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte imbalance and consider further treatment if necessary.
6. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's anemia, including iron studies and transfusions.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider further evaluation and treatment if necessary.
8. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's pulmonary and cardiac complications, including echocardiography and stress testing."
