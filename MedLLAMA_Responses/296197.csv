   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 54-year-old portugese-speaking woman with likely metastatic
   bronchogenic carcinoma, and bilateral pulmonary emboli, who is
   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] hospital for evaluation for cord
   compression.
   .
   # Back pain: MRI with evidence of cord comression, however neurologic
   symptoms in OSH ED were likely [**3-3**] pain and not consistent with T6
   lesion.  Currently neurologically intact.  She was evaluted by
   neurosurgery on admission.  Will hold on steroids per their recs and
   given clinical stability. CT without contrast of thoracic and lumbar
   spine complete, awaiting final read.
   - bedrest, TLSO, logroll precautions until brace
   - neurosurgery recs.
   .
   # Pulmonary emboli: No current evidence of hemodynamic compromise from
   PE.  However, they appear significant on imaging.  Further embolization
   from deep veins could be fatal, however systemic anticoagulation
   contraindicated given brain mets.
   - DVT filter to be placed by IR
   .
   # Bronchogenic carcinoma: Needs tissue diagnosis.  Pulmonary was
   consulted.
   - Broncoscopy and biopsy on [**9-5**]
   - Will consult Rad-Onc in AM for consideration of XRT
   .
   # Herpes opthamicus: Followed by [**Hospital 2663**]; has been on
   acyclovir for what should be a 2 year course.
   - continue acyclovir
   - outpatient follow up.
   .
   # Leukocytosis and hyperglycemia: mild and likely related to
   prednisone.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma, bilateral pulmonary emboli, and suspected cord compression. She was evaluated by neurosurgery and pulmonary medicine. The patient has a history of herpes opthalmicus and is being treated with acyclovir. She has mild leukocytosis and hyperglycemia, likely related to prednisone. The patient is receiving prophylactic subcutaneous heparin and has an IVF line. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.8°F, heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 89/58 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has bilateral pulmonary emboli, which can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Cord compression: The patient has a suspected cord compression, which can cause neurological deficits or paralysis if not treated promptly.
3. Metastatic spread: The patient has metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma, which can spread to other parts of the body, leading to further complications.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of herpes opthalmicus and is being treated with acyclovir, which increases the risk of infection.
5. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has mild leukocytosis and hyperglycemia, which can lead to electrolyte imbalance if not properly managed.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving nutrition through an IVF line, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies if not properly monitored.
8. Vascular access complications: The patient has multiple IV lines, which can increase the risk of vascular access complications.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk of developing a stress ulcer due to her underlying medical conditions and treatment.
10. VAP: The patient is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to her respiratory support.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient is a 54-year-old female with metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma, bilateral pulmonary emboli, and suspected cord compression. She has a history of osteosarcoma and has been on acyclovir for herpes opthamicus.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
* Heart rate: 91 bpm (normal range 79-92 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 89/58 mmHg (normal range 65-120/76-84 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (normal range 12-20 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 93%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Neuro: Alert and oriented, no sensory deficit in lower extremities, normal Babinski reflex
* Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops
* Respiratory: Mild wheezing, good air movement
* Abdominal: Soft, nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds
* Extremities: Warm

The patient's laboratory results are:

* WBC: 12.5 K/uL
* Hct: 38.0%
* Platelets: 302 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 128 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.1/25.8/1.2, ALT/AST: 14/23, Alk Phos/T Bili: 179/0.4, Differential-Neuts: 93.8%, Lymph: 4.4%, Mono: 1.5%, Eos: 0.1%, Albumin: 4.0 g/dL, LDH: 467 IU/L, Ca++: 9.3 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 4.3 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has bilateral pulmonary emboli, which can lead to further embolization and potentially fatal consequences.
2. Cord compression: The patient has suspected cord compression, which can lead to neurological deficits and paralysis.
3. Metastatic disease: The patient has metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma, which can spread to other parts of the body and cause further complications.
4. Leukocytosis and hyperglycemia: The patient has mild leukocytosis and hyperglycemia, which may be related to prednisone therapy and require further monitoring.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of herpes opthamicus and is receiving acyclovir therapy, which may increase the risk of infection.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of osteosarcoma and may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to the tumor.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her medical conditions to prevent complications and improve her quality of life."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old Portuguese-speaking woman with a diagnosis of likely metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma, bilateral pulmonary emboli, and cord compression. She is currently admitted to the ICU for evaluation and management of her condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 75 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 100/68 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 98%.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to her inability to move or assess certain areas of her body. However, her peripheral vascular examination is unremarkable, and her skin examination is not assessable.

The patient's laboratory results show mild leukocytosis and hyperglycemia, which may be related to her prednisone therapy. Her complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic panel (BMP) are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated white blood cell count.

The patient's imaging studies show evidence of metastatic disease in the thoracic and lumbar spine, as well as in the right iliac bone, liver, and adrenal glands. Her right hilar mass is consistent with known lung cancer, and she has atelectasis in the left lung.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Cancer (malignant neoplasm), lung: The patient has a diagnosis of likely metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma.
2. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety related to her condition and treatment.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE), acute: The patient has bilateral pulmonary emboli, which are being treated with anticoagulation therapy.
4. Cord compression: The patient has cord compression due to her metastatic disease, which is being treated with radiation therapy.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Bedrest, TLSO, and logroll precautions until her brace is fitted.
2. Q4hr neuro checks to monitor her neurologic status.
3. Radiation therapy today on [**Hospital Ward Name**].
4. DVT filter placement by interventional radiology (IR).
5. Bronchoscopy and biopsy on [**9-5**].
6. Continue acyclovir therapy for herpes opthamicus.
7. Outpatient follow-up with social work.
8. Continue to trend CBC to monitor her leukocytosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's bilateral pulmonary emboli and atelectasis in the left lung may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's metastatic disease may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Neurologic complications: The patient's cord compression may lead to neurologic complications, such as paralysis or numbness.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state may increase her risk of infection.
5. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase her risk of bleeding.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   This is a 54-year-old portugese-speaking woman with likely metastatic
   bronchogenic carcinoma, and bilateral pulmonary emboli, who is
   transferred from [**Hospital 880**] hospital for evaluation for cord
   compression.
   # Back pain: MRI with evidence of cord comression, however neurologic
   symptoms in OSH ED were likely [**3-3**] pain and not consistent with T6
   lesion.  Currently neurologically intact.  She was evaluted by
   neurosurgery on admission.  Will hold on steroids per their recs and
   given clinical stability. CT without contrast of thoracic and lumbar
   spine complete, awaiting final read.
   - bedrest, TLSO, logroll precautions until brace
   - q4hr neuro checks
   - radiation today on [**Hospital Ward Name **]
   # Pulmonary emboli: No current evidence of hemodynamic compromise from
   PE.  However, they appear significant on imaging.  Further embolization
   from deep veins could be fatal, however systemic anticoagulation
   contraindicated given brain mets.
   - IVC filter in place
   # Bronchogenic carcinoma: Needs tissue diagnosis.  Pulmonary was
   consulted.
   - Broncoscopy and biopsy on [**9-5**]
   - f/u path report
   - Radiation on [**Hospital Ward Name **] today
   # Herpes opthamicus: Followed by [**Hospital 2663**]; has been on
   acyclovir for what should be a 2 year course.
   - continue acyclovir

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old Portuguese-speaking woman with a diagnosis of likely metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma, bilateral pulmonary emboli, and cord compression. She was transferred from another hospital for evaluation and management. The patient is currently on bedrest with a TLSO brace and logroll precautions. She is receiving anticoagulation therapy with an IVC filter in place. A bronchoscopy and biopsy were performed on 9/5, and radiation therapy is scheduled for today.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary embolism (PE) - further embolization from deep veins could be fatal, and systemic anticoagulation is contraindicated due to brain metastases.
2. Cord compression - further compression could lead to neurological deficits or even paralysis.
3. Metastatic disease - the patient has widespread metastases, including in the vertebrae, iliac bone, hilar mass, and liver, which could lead to further complications such as spinal cord compression, respiratory failure, or liver failure.
4. Infection - the patient has a history of herpes opthalmicus and is receiving acyclovir, which could lead to antibiotic-resistant infections.
5. Leukocytosis and hyperglycemia - these conditions could worsen and lead to complications such as sepsis or organ failure.
6. Radiation therapy - the patient is scheduled to receive radiation therapy, which could lead to radiation-related complications such as nausea, vomiting, or mucositis.
7. IVC filter - the patient has an IVC filter in place, which could lead to complications such as filter migration, perforation, or thrombosis.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and address these potential complications."
