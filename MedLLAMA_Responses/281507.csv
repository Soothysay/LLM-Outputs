You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG who presents with BRBPR in the setting of increasing fatigue. The patient has a acute on chronic left subdural hemorrhage with associated 5mm rightward midline shift, which is likely related to a fall and head trauma a few weeks ago.

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, but has a number of potential complications that could arise. These include:

1. GI bleed: The patient is at risk for further GI bleeding, particularly in the setting of ongoing anticoagulation and the presence of a subdural hemorrhage.
2. Subdural hematoma expansion: The patient's subdural hemorrhage is acute on chronic, and there is a risk of expansion, which could lead to increased intracranial pressure and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone CABG, and there is a risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, MI, or cardiac arrest.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient has low lung volumes and pulmonic vascular congestion on CXR, which could lead to respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly in the setting of GI bleeding and the presence of a central line.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and there is a risk of worsening hypothyroidism in the setting of stress and critical illness.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has a history of electrolyte imbalance, and there is a risk of worsening electrolyte imbalance in the setting of GI bleeding and the use of diuretics.
8. Renal insufficiency: The patient has a history of renal insufficiency, and there is a risk of worsening renal insufficiency in the setting of GI bleeding and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
9. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of coagulopathy, and there is a risk of worsening coagulopathy in the setting of GI bleeding and the use of anticoagulation.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. GI consult to evaluate and manage the patient's BRBPR.
2. Serial HCT with a goal of >25 to monitor for anemia and bleeding.
3. Type and cross the patient's blood.
4. Prepare the patient for possible colonoscopy in the morning.
5. Hold ASA in the setting of GI bleed and subdural hemorrhage.
6. Continue Keppra 500mg PO/IV bid for prophylaxis against seizures.
7. Serial neuro exams to monitor for worsening neurologic status.
8. Hold antihypertensives in the setting of GI bleed.
9. Hold statin acutely, plan to restart on medical floor.
10. Continue levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.
11. Hold prostate meds in setting of GI bleed, if difficulty passing urine, place foley.
12. IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO.
13. Pneumoboots for prophylaxis against VAP.
14. Peripheral IV access.

The patient's disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement, and they may be able to go to the floor today."

   Consider checking b-12 and folate as outpatient
   - GI work up per above
   - Serial hct q8, goal > 25
   .
   # ECG changes: Patient without any chest pain and CE enzymes negative
   times one.  The mild elevations in aVR could be consistent with a very
   proximal LAD lesion.  However given his CABG his anatomy is likely
   altered giving the aVR change questionable significance.  In the
   setting of some other TWF, this may just represent mild demand
   ischemia.  Given other issues would not be a candidate for
   anticoagulation at this time.
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of CAD, s/p CABG, who presents with BRBPR in the setting of increasing fatigue. The patient has a CT head showing an acute on chronic left subdural hemorrhage with a 5mm rightward midline shift.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, and blood pressure of 133/55 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy, and their SpO2 is 100%. The patient is also receiving IV fluids and has received 3 pRBCs.

The patient's physical examination reveals rales at the bases bilaterally, some coarse breath sounds on the right, and a systolic murmur best heard over the pulmonic area and radiating to the carotids. The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, and a platelet count of 228 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's medical conditions include CAD, s/p CABG, and a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient is also taking medications for these conditions, including aspirin, metoprolol, and levothyroxine.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. GI bleed: The patient has a history of BRBPR, and the patient's laboratory results show anemia, which may be related to a GI bleed.
2. Subdural hemorrhage: The patient has a CT head showing an acute on chronic left subdural hemorrhage with a 5mm rightward midline shift, which may require surgical intervention.
3. Hypovolemic shock: The patient has received 3 pRBCs, and the patient's laboratory results show anemia, which may indicate hypovolemic shock.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's physical examination reveals rales at the bases bilaterally, which may indicate respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD, s/p CABG, and the patient's laboratory results show an elevated troponin-T level, which may indicate cardiac complications.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's physical examination reveals a systolic murmur, which may indicate neurological complications.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including GI bleed, subdural hemorrhage, hypovolemic shock, respiratory failure, cardiac complications, and neurological complications. The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed, blood loss anemia, and subdural hematoma. The patient has undergone recent blood transfusions, and his hemoglobin level has increased to 27.4 g/dL.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 69 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 111/59 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

The patient's physical examination is notable for mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant (LLQ) of the abdomen, but otherwise, he appears comfortable and is not in acute distress.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 24.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 228 K/uL. His creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL, and his troponin level is less than 0.01 ng/mL. His blood glucose level is 131 mg/dL.

The patient has a subacute subdural hematoma, which is not affecting his sensorium. He is being monitored closely by the neurosurgery team and will undergo repeat head CT and continue Keppra.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Continued bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, leading to further blood loss and anemia.
2. Development of sepsis or multi-organ failure due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and the risk of secondary infections.
3. Increased intracranial pressure or worsening of the subdural hematoma, potentially leading to neurological decline or even death.
4. Electrolyte imbalances or renal dysfunction due to the patient's fluid and electrolyte management.
5. Gastrointestinal perforation or abscess formation, potentially leading to further complications and increased morbidity.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continued preparation for colonoscopy, repeat head CT, and close monitoring by the neurosurgery team. The patient is also receiving prophylactic anticoagulation and stress ulcer prophylaxis."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of altered mental status and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has been experiencing episodes of confusion, agitation, and delirium, which is likely related to the underlying medical conditions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure of 131/62 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, and a platelet count of 228. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are within normal limits.

The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is ongoing, with a total output of 350 mL of blood over the past 24 hours. The patient's abdominal pain is moderate, and the patient has a bowel movement of 10 mL of blood.

The patient's neurological status is altered, with episodes of confusion, agitation, and delirium. The patient's neurological examination is unchanged from admission, with no focal neurological deficits.

The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a recent myocardial infarction.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate the presence of an infection.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to hypovolemic shock, electrolyte imbalance, and acid-base disturbances.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may lead to increased risk of falls, self-extubation, and other complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, which may indicate the presence of respiratory failure or impending respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's recent myocardial infarction and ongoing hypertension may lead to cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.

In conclusion, the patient is a high-risk ICU admission with ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, altered mental status, and potential for sepsis, respiratory failure, and cardiac complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG who presents with BRBPR
   in the setting of increasing fatigue.
   .
   # BRBPR: Differential includes diverticulosis, hemmorhoidal bleed,
   colonic mass, colitis, ulcer, less likely IBD/UC.  Patient has never
   had a colonoscopy.  Currently overall hemodynamically stable and it is
   likely that we may perform colonoscopy while patient on floor.
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Plan to defer colonoscopy at this time given bradycardia/need for
   sedation for procedure
   - Maintain 2 PIV, large-bore
   - Serial hct q8, goal > 25
   - Continue active type and cross
   - NPO other than colonoscopy prep
   - Maintenance IVF; bolus prn
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
   .
   # Anemia: likely mostly GI related and Fe def.  Will check Fe labs.
   Consider checking b-12 and folate as outpatient
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Serial hct q12, goal > 25
   .
   # EKG changes: Patient without any chest pain and CE enzymes negative.
   The mild elevations in aVR could be consistent with a very proximal LAD
   lesion.  However given CABG, his anatomy likely altered and
   questionable significance of the aVR change. In the setting of some
   other TWF, this may just represent mild demand ischemia. Patient had
   episode of bradycardia overnight and appears to be sinus bradycardia
   with repeat EKG Given other issues would not be a candidate for
   anticoagulation at this time.
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Repeat EKG and follow
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
   - Follow neuro exam
   .
   # SDH: Patient with acute on chronic subdural bleed.  Likely related to
   fall and head trauma a few weeks ago. Neurosurgery has agreed patient
   is a candidate for floor.
   - Appreciate neurosurg recs; follow CT head for SDH/bradycardia
   - Keppra 500mg PO/IV bid for prophylaxis
   - Follow neuro exam
   .
   # HTN: Holding antihypertensives in the setting of GI bleed
   .
   # HLD: Holding statin acutely, plan to restart on medical floor
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # BPH: Holding prostate meds in setting of GI bleed.  If difficulty
   passing urine will place foley.
   .
   # FEN: Maintenance IVF; bolus prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for
   procedure
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: PIVx1; will attempt to replace a second IV today
   # Communication: Patient, patient
s family
   # Code:  Full (although patient wants to talk with family about
   options)
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement; likely can go to floor
   today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG who presents with BRBPR
   in the setting of increasing fatigue.
   .
   # BRBPR: Differential includes diverticulosis, hemmorhoidal bleed,
   colonic mass, colitis, ulcer, less likely IBD/UC.  Patient has never
   had a colonoscopy.  Currently overall hemodynamically stable and it is
   likely that we may perform colonoscopy while patient on floor.
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Plan to defer colonoscopy at this time given bradycardia/need for
   sedation for procedure
   - Maintain 2 PIV, large-bore
   - Serial hct q8, goal > 25
   - Continue active type and cross
   - NPO other than colonoscopy prep
   - Maintenance IVF; bolus prn
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
   .
   # Anemia: likely mostly GI related and Fe def.  Will check Fe labs.
   Consider checking b-12 and folate as outpatient
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Serial hct q12, goal > 25
   .
   # EKG changes: Patient without any chest pain and CE enzymes negative.
   The mild elevations in aVR could be consistent with a very proximal LAD
   lesion.  However given CABG, his anatomy likely altered and
   questionable significance of the aVR change. In the setting of some
   other TWF, this may just represent mild demand ischemia. Patient had
   episode of bradycardia overnight and appears to be sinus bradycardia
   with repeat EKG Given other issues would not be a candidate for
   anticoagulation at this time.
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Repeat EKG and follow
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
   - Follow neuro exam
   .
   # SDH: Patient with acute on chronic subdural bleed.  Likely related to
   fall and head trauma a few weeks ago. Neurosurgery has agreed patient
   is a candidate for floor.
   - Appreciate neurosurg recs; follow CT head for SDH/bradycardia
   - Keppra 500mg PO/IV bid for prophylaxis
   - Follow neuro exam

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG who presents with BRBPR in the setting of increasing fatigue. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 131/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 98%.

The patient has a history of anemia, likely mostly GI related and Fe deficient. The patient's EKG shows mild elevations in aVR, which could be consistent with a very proximal LAD lesion, but given the patient's CABG, the anatomy is likely altered, and the significance of the aVR change is questionable.

The patient has a subdural hematoma (SDH) likely related to a fall and head trauma a few weeks ago. Neurosurgery has agreed that the patient is a candidate for floor care.

The patient has several medical conditions, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The patient is currently holding antihypertensives, statin, and prostate medications in the setting of GI bleed.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL, and a hematocrit of 24.2%. The patient's white blood cell count is 8.2 K/uL, and his platelet count is 228 K/uL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. GI bleeding: The patient is at risk for further GI bleeding, particularly in the setting of anticoagulation therapy.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may be related to his underlying medical conditions, such as CAD, or may be a side effect of medication.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as cardiovascular instability.
4. Subdural hematoma: The patient's SDH may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further neurological complications.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly in the setting of GI bleed and subdural hematoma.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's underlying CAD and anemia may lead to cardiovascular instability, particularly if not properly managed.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend that the patient continue to receive close monitoring and management of his medical conditions, including anticoagulation therapy, GI bleed management, and anemia management. The patient should also receive prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # EKG changes: Patient without any chest pain and CE enzymes negative.
   The mild elevations in aVR could be consistent with a very proximal LAD

   questionable significance of the aVR change. In the setting of some
   other TWF, this may just represent mild demand ischemia. Patient had
   episode of bradycardia overnight and appears to be sinus bradycardia

Summary:

The patient, an 86-year-old male with a history of CAD and CABG, is currently admitted to the ICU with BRBPR, anemia, and SDH. The patient has been experiencing increasing fatigue and has a history of falls and head trauma. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL, and an elevated white blood cell count. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 131/62 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with no acute distress, conjunctiva pale, and oropharynx clear. The patient's neurological examination is also unremarkable, with no focal deficits, and motor strength is symmetric in upper and lower extremities.

The patient's medical history includes CAD, CABG, hypertension, hypothyroidism, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and falls with head trauma. The patient is currently taking medications for these conditions, including aspirin, statin, and levothyroxine.

The patient's current medications include lorazepam, aspirin, statin, levothyroxine, and fentanyl.

Potential medical complications:

1. GI bleed: The patient's BRBPR and anemia may be related to a GI bleed, which could worsen and lead to further complications.
2. SDH: The patient's acute on chronic SDH may worsen and lead to further neurological complications.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen and lead to further complications, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cognitive function.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen and lead to further complications.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen and lead to further complications, such as fatigue, cold intolerance, and weight gain.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen and lead to further complications, such as cardiac events, stroke, and kidney damage.

The patient's current plan includes:

* GI consult for further evaluation and management of BRBPR and anemia
* Serial hct q12, goal > 25
* Continue active type and cross
* NPO other than colonoscopy prep
* Maintenance IVF; bolus prn
* Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
* Follow neuro exam
* Consider checking b-12 and folate as outpatient"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old man admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed and subdural hematoma (SDH). He is experiencing increased confusion, bradycardia, and encephalopathy. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/62 mmHg. He is receiving various medications, including lorazepam and prophylactic antibiotics. Laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated creatinine and lactate levels.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient's bleeding is likely due to a lower gastrointestinal source, and colonoscopy has been delayed due to bradycardia.
2. SDH: The patient's SDH is not affecting his sensorium, but his increased confusion and bradycardia warrant repeat non-contrast head CT imaging.
3. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is being monitored, and his blood pressure is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septicemia: The patient's elevated lactate levels and thrombocytopenia may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Gastrointestinal perforation: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed may lead to perforation, which can cause peritonitis and sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's encephalopathy and decreased level of consciousness may lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's bradycardia and decreased cardiac output may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock.
5. Neurological deterioration: The patient's SDH and encephalopathy may lead to neurological deterioration, which can result in permanent brain damage or death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Consider adjusting the patient's medications to address his bradycardia and encephalopathy.
3. Perform a repeat non-contrast head CT to assess the patient's SDH.
4. Consider consulting a neurosurgeon to assess the patient's SDH and potential surgical intervention.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide supportive care as needed."

   left subdural hematoma along
   frontal and parietal lobe without increase in associated mass effect.
   The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG who presents with BRBPR
   in the setting of increasing fatigue.
   .
   # BRBPR: Has been without repeat episodes of bloody stool x3 days.
   Differential includes diverticulosis, hemmorhoidal bleed, colonic mass,
   colitis, ulcer, less likely IBD/UC.  Patient has never had a
   colonoscopy.  Currently overall hemodynamically stable and it is likely
   that we may perform colonoscopy while patient on floor.
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Plan to defer colonoscopy at this time given bradycardia/need for
   sedation for procedure
   - Maintain 2 PIV, large-bore
   - Serial hct q8, goal > 25
   - Continue active type and cross
   - NPO other than colonoscopy prep
   - Maintenance IVF; bolus prn
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
   .
   # Anemia: likely mostly GI related and Fe def.  Will check Fe labs.
   Consider checking b-12 and folate as outpatient
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Serial hct q12, goal > 25
   .
   # EKG changes: Patient without any chest pain and CE enzymes negative.
   The mild elevations in aVR could be consistent with a very proximal LAD
   lesion.  However given CABG, his anatomy likely altered and
   questionable significance of the aVR change. In the setting of some
   other TWF, this may just represent mild demand ischemia. Patient had
   episode of bradycardia overnight and appears to be sinus bradycardia
   with repeat EKG Given other issues would not be a candidate for
   anticoagulation at this time.
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Repeat EKG and follow
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
   - Follow neuro exam
   .
   # SDH: Patient with acute on chronic subdural bleed.  Likely related to
   fall and head trauma a few weeks ago. Neurosurgery has agreed patient
   is a candidate for floor.
   - Appreciate neurosurg recs; follow CT head for SDH/bradycardia
   - Keppra 500mg PO/IV bid for prophylaxis
   - Follow neuro exam
   .
   # HTN: Holding antihypertensives in the setting of GI bleed
   .
   # HLD: Holding statin acutely, plan to restart on medical floor
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # BPH: Holding prostate meds in setting of GI bleed.  If difficulty
   passing urine will place foley.
   .
   # FEN: Maintenance IVF; bolus prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for
   procedure
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: PIVx1; will attempt to replace a second IV today
   # Communication: Patient, patient
s family
   # Code:  Full (although patient wants to talk with family about
   options)
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement; likely can go to floor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of CAD and CABG, who presents with BRBPR in the setting of increasing fatigue. The patient has been experiencing bradycardia throughout the day, with a low of 29 beats per minute while sleeping, but remains asymptomatic. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 39 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/55 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%.

The patient's physical examination reveals rales at the bases bilaterally, a III/VI systolic murmur best heard over the pulmonic area and radiating to the carotids, and symmetric motor function in upper and lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, and a hematocrit of 29.0%. The patient's platelet count is 222 K/uL, and his white blood cell count is 8.2.

The patient has a history of SDH, likely related to a fall and head trauma a few weeks ago, and is a candidate for floor transfer according to neurosurgery. The patient is also experiencing GI bleeding, with a differential diagnosis including diverticulosis, hemorrhoidal bleed, colonic mass, colitis, and ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's GI bleeding can lead to further bleeding complications, such as hemodynamic instability, anemia, and potentially life-threatening bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient's history of SDH and potential for further bleeding can increase the risk of infection, particularly meningitis or subdural empyema.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's rales at the bases bilaterally can indicate pneumonia or other respiratory infections, which can worsen his condition.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and CABG, combined with his bradycardia and potential for further bleeding, can increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Anemia and bleeding: The patient's anemia and ongoing bleeding can lead to further complications, such as hypovolemic shock or respiratory failure.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's history of SDH and potential for further bleeding can increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, increased intracranial pressure, or brainstem compression.

Based on the patient's conditions and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings closely, and to adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these complications."

   The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG who presents with BRBPR
   in the setting of increasing fatigue.
   .
   # BRBPR: Has been without repeat episodes of bloody stool x3 days.
   Differential includes diverticulosis, hemmorhoidal bleed, colonic mass,
   colitis, ulcer, less likely IBD/UC.  Patient has never had a
   colonoscopy.  Currently overall hemodynamically stable and it is likely
   that we may perform colonoscopy while patient on floor.
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Plan to defer colonoscopy at this time given bradycardia/need for
   sedation for procedure
   - Maintain 2 PIV, large-bore
   - Serial hct q12, goal > 25
   - Continue active type and cross
   - NPO other than colonoscopy prep
   - Maintenance IVF; bolus prn
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
   .
   # Bradycardia: Has had episodes of bradycardia during MICU
   hospitalization. Asymptomatic through this time.
   - Pacer pads by bedside
   - Consult EP
   .
   # Anemia: likely mostly GI related and Fe def.  Will check Fe labs.
   Consider checking b-12 and folate as outpatient
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Serial hct q12, goal > 25
   .
   # EKG changes: Patient without any chest pain and CE enzymes negative.
   The mild elevations in aVR could be consistent with a very proximal LAD
   lesion.  However given CABG, his anatomy likely altered and
   questionable significance of the aVR change. In the setting of some
   other TWF, this may just represent mild demand ischemia. Patient had
   episode of bradycardia overnight and appears to be sinus bradycardia
   with repeat EKG Given other issues would not be a candidate for
   anticoagulation at this time.
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Repeat EKG and follow
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
   - Follow neuro exam
   .
   # SDH: Patient with acute on chronic subdural bleed.  Likely related to
   fall and head trauma a few weeks ago. Neurosurgery has agreed patient
   is a candidate for floor.
   - Appreciate neurosurg recs; follow CT head for SDH/bradycardia
   - Keppra 500mg PO/IV bid for prophylaxis
   - Follow neuro exam
   .
   # HTN: Holding antihypertensives in the setting of GI bleed
   .
   # HLD: Holding statin acutely, plan to restart on medical floor
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # BPH: Holding prostate meds in setting of GI bleed.  If difficulty
   passing urine will place foley.
   .
   # FEN: Maintenance IVF; bolus prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for
   procedure
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: PIVx1; will attempt to replace a second IV today
   # Communication: Patient, patient
s family
   # Code:  Full (although patient wants to talk with family about
   options)
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement; likely can go to floor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with bloody rectal bleeding (BRBPR) in the setting of increasing fatigue. The patient has had episodes of bradycardia during his hospitalization, which is asymptomatic. The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, and he is likely to undergo a colonoscopy on the floor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. GI bleed: The patient's BRBPR may worsen, leading to hemorrhagic shock or require surgical intervention.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's asymptomatic bradycardia may progress to symptomatic bradycardia, which can lead to cardiac arrest or arrhythmias.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or seizures.
5. Increased intracranial pressure: The patient's subdural hematoma may worsen, leading to increased intracranial pressure, which can cause neurological deficits or death.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's risk of developing pneumonia is increased due to his age, underlying medical conditions, and prolonged hospitalization.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's risk of developing deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism is increased due to his immobility and underlying medical conditions.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's risk of developing a stress ulcer is increased due to his underlying medical conditions, prolonged hospitalization, and use of corticosteroids.
9. Infection: The patient's risk of developing an infection is increased due to his underlying medical conditions, prolonged hospitalization, and invasive medical devices.
10. Medication-related complications: The patient's risk of developing medication-related complications is increased due to his multiple medications and underlying medical conditions.

To mitigate these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring, aggressive management of his underlying medical conditions, and prompt intervention if any complications arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG who presents with BRBPR
   in the setting of increasing fatigue.
   # BRBPR: Has been without repeat episodes of bloody stool x3 days.
   Differential includes diverticulosis, hemmorhoidal bleed, colonic mass,
   colitis, ulcer, less likely IBD/UC.  Patient has never had a
   colonoscopy.  Currently overall hemodynamically stable and it is likely
   that we may perform colonoscopy while patient on floor.
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Plan to defer colonoscopy at this time given bradycardia/need for
   sedation for procedure
   - Maintain 2 PIV, large-bore
   - Serial hct q8, goal > 25
   - Continue active type and cross
   - NPO other than colonoscopy prep
   - Maintenance IVF; bolus prn
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
   # Anemia: likely mostly GI related and Fe def.  Will check Fe labs.
   Consider checking b-12 and folate as outpatient
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Serial hct q12, goal > 25
   # EKG changes: Patient without any chest pain and CE enzymes negative.
   The mild elevations in aVR could be consistent with a very proximal LAD
   lesion.  However given CABG, his anatomy likely altered and
   questionable significance of the aVR change. In the setting of some
   other TWF, this may just represent mild demand ischemia. Patient had
   episode of bradycardia overnight and appears to be sinus bradycardia
   with repeat EKG Given other issues would not be a candidate for
   anticoagulation at this time.
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Repeat EKG and follow; EP consult
 might need pacer particularly in
   light of recent hx of falls with subdural.
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
   - Follow neuro exam
   # SDH: Patient with acute on chronic subdural bleed.  Likely related to
   fall and head trauma a few weeks ago. Neurosurgery has agreed patient
   is a candidate for floor.
   - Appreciate neurosurg recs; follow CT head for SDH/bradycardia
   - Keppra 500mg PO/IV bid for prophylaxis
   - Follow neuro exam
   # HTN: Holding antihypertensives in the setting of GI bleed
   .
   # HLD: Holding statin acutely, plan to restart on medical floor
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # BPH: Holding prostate meds in setting of GI bleed.  If difficulty
   passing urine will place foley.
   .
   # FEN: Maintenance IVF; bolus prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for
   procedure
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: PIVx1; will attempt to replace a second IV today
   # Communication: Patient, patient
s family
   # Code:  Full (although patient wants to talk with family about
   options)
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement; likely can go to floor
   today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and subdural hematoma (SDH) who presented with bloody rectal bleeding (BRBPR) and increasing fatigue. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is hemodynamically stable. The patient has been without repeat episodes of BRBPR for three days, and the differential diagnosis includes diverticulosis, hemorrhoidal bleed, colonic mass, colitis, and ulcer. A colonoscopy is planned, but it has been deferred due to the patient's bradycardia and need for sedation.

The patient has anemia, likely related to gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and iron deficiency. He is also taking anticoagulation medications, which have been held due to the GI bleed.

The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) shows mild elevations in aVR, which could be consistent with a proximal left anterior descending (LAD) lesion. However, given the patient's history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), the significance of the aVR change is questionable.

The patient has a history of falls and has developed a subdural hematoma, which is being managed with keppra prophylaxis and close monitoring of his neurologic exam.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk of further GI bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and multi-organ failure.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen if not properly managed, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
3. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia could worsen if not properly managed, leading to decreased cardiac output and potential cardiac arrest.
4. Subdural hematoma: The patient's subdural hematoma could worsen if not properly managed, leading to increased intracranial pressure and potential neurological deficits.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly pneumonia and urinary tract infections, due to his prolonged hospital stay and immunocompromised state.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD and CABG makes him at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of falls and subdural hematoma makes him at risk for neurological complications, such as seizures and neurological deficits.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage potential medical complications."
