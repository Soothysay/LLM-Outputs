You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, altered mental status, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has been receiving midazolam infusions and has been mechanically ventilated. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, and blood pressure of 111/72 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 98% on a FiO2 of 60%. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has received antibiotics, including cefipime and levofloxacin.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are normal, but the patient's lactate level is elevated at 1.4 mmol/L.

The patient's imaging studies show a normal head CT scan without contrast.

The patient's plan includes ongoing mechanical ventilation, sedation with midazolam, and antibiotics. The patient's skin integrity is impaired, and the patient is at risk for further skin breakdown.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and the patient is at risk for further deterioration.
2. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and altered mental status make the patient susceptible to infection.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate level and abnormal white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis.
4. Bleeding: The patient's abnormal platelet count and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) suggest the possibility of bleeding complications.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and abnormal blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level suggest the possibility of renal failure.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) suggest the possibility of cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's impaired skin integrity and altered mental status make the patient susceptible to gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and sedation with midazolam.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation settings as necessary.
3. Administer antibiotics as prescribed and monitor for signs of infection.
4. Monitor the patient's lactate level and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's creatinine level and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Consider gastrointestinal prophylaxis to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including atrial fibrillation, chronic venous stasis changes, and a history of thrombosis. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia, tachypnea, and pyuria. She was intubated and is being treated for pneumonia, which is suspected to be healthcare-associated. She has a radial arterial line in place for blood pressure monitoring.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, and blood pressure of 111/72 mmHg. She is sedated and has a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on 60% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate level. Her creatinine level is elevated, and she has mild chronic kidney disease. Her electrolyte levels are normal, but her calcium and magnesium levels are slightly elevated.

The patient's physical examination shows bilateral lower extremity erythema and warmth, which is likely due to chronic venous stasis changes. She has a rash on her lower extremities, which is not specified as to whether it is due to cellulitis or chronic venous stasis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and tachypnea put her at risk for respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Atrial thrombus: The patient's history of thrombosis and the presence of an atrial thrombus increase her risk for embolic stroke or systemic thromboembolism.
3. Hypercoagulable state: The patient's history of thrombosis and the presence of an atrial thrombus suggest a hypercoagulable state, which may increase her risk for further thrombotic events.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and mild chronic kidney disease put her at risk for acute kidney injury or worsening renal function.
5. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and pyuria put her at risk for sepsis, which may require aggressive treatment and close monitoring.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may increase her risk for stroke or systemic thromboembolism, particularly if she has a hypercoagulable state.
7. Chronic venous stasis changes: The patient's bilateral lower extremity erythema and warmth may be a sign of chronic venous stasis changes, which may increase her risk for further complications, such as cellulitis or deep vein thrombosis.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, including respiratory failure, atrial thrombus, hypercoagulable state, renal failure, sepsis, atrial fibrillation, and chronic venous stasis changes. Close monitoring and aggressive treatment are necessary to prevent or manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple medical problems who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia, tachypnea, pneumonia, pyuria, and was intubated. The patient's conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has pneumonia, and the most likely cause is a perfusion barrier from pneumonia. Other possible etiologies include pulmonary edema and aspiration.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has a right mid-zone pneumonia on CXR, and she is at risk for resistant organisms due to her healthcare contact and recent admission. She is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and levofloxacin.
3. Pyuria: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) pending, and she has had previous infections with pan-sensitive Proteus and E. coli. She is being treated with antibiotics that cover her previous infections.
4. Atrial thrombus: The patient has a history of thrombosis and is at risk for hypercoagulability. She is being treated with IV heparin and may need long-term low-molecular-weight heparin.
5. AMS (Altered Mental Status): The patient's AMS is likely due to toxic metabolic causes, but given her hypercoagulable history and the presence of an atrial thrombus, stroke is possible. A CT head is planned to rule out bleeding before starting heparin.
6. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure has resolved, and her creatinine level has returned to baseline. The likely cause is a prerenal etiology.
7. HOCM/Diastolic CHF: The patient has mild CHF, and her BNP level is mildly elevated. She is being evaluated with an echocardiogram.
8. LE erythema: The patient's lower extremity erythema is likely due to chronic venous stasis changes, but cellulitis is in the differential. She is being treated with vancomycin.
9. Afib: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and her rhythm is irregular. She is being treated with metoprolol IV push to see how she responds.
10. Abd pain: The patient has mild abdominal pain, and her GGT and AP levels are mildly elevated. The cause is unclear, but she may have had transient mesenteric ischemia given her history.
11. HTN: The patient's blood pressure is currently normal, and she is infected with sepsis. Her antihypertensives are being held.
12. DM: The patient's diabetes is being managed with insulin, and her requirements will likely be different from her home regimen.
13. Gout: The patient's gout is being managed with allopurinol, which is being held to reduce side effects.
14. Glaucoma: The patient's glaucoma is being managed with eye drops.
15. Chronic low back pain: The patient's chronic low back pain is being managed with pain control as needed.
16. FEN: The patient is NPO, and tube feeds are planned. She will require a nutrition consult and repletion of electrolytes as needed.
17. Access: The patient has a radial arterial line and a peripheral intravenous line.
18. PPx: The patient's INR is therapeutic, and she is being treated with bowel regimen, H2 blocker, and heparin.

Based on the patient's conditions and potential medical complications, the following recommendations are made:

1. Continue treatment for pneumonia, pyuria, and atrial thrombus.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation as needed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's AMS and potential stroke risk.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Evaluate the patient's HOCM/Diastolic CHF and potential cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Manage the patient's LE erythema and potential cellulitis.
7. Monitor the patient's abdominal pain and potential bowel ischemia.
8. Manage the patient's HTN and sepsis.
9. Manage the patient's DM and potential electrolyte imbalances.
10. Manage the patient's gout and potential side effects.
11. Manage the patient's glaucoma and potential eye complications.
12. Manage the patient's chronic low back pain and potential complications.
13. Monitor the patient's FEN and potential nutritional deficiencies.
14. Monitor the patient's access lines and potential complications.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU care."

   79 yo female admit with tachypnea and hypoxia in the setting of
   significant cardiac disease.  By report patient had mild abdominal pain
   and dyspnea and then to ED where eval showed significant hypoxemia and
   altered mental status.  Patient intubated with tachypnea and with fever
   and right sided infiltrate pneumonia suspected.  CT abdomen did show no
   evidence of intraabdominal pathology.  She was admitted to ICU for
   further care with persistent tachycardia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female admitted to the ICU with tachypnea and hypoxia in the setting of significant cardiac disease. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 60% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 177, indicating severe hypoxemia. The patient has a suspected right-sided infiltrate pneumonia, and sputum culture and influenza aspirate have been sent for further evaluation. The patient is also at risk for extrapulmonary shunting, which will be evaluated further.

The patient's cardiac status is also critical, with atrial fibrillation and a history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin IV and ASA.

The patient's neurological status is also concerning, with altered mental status and a possible atrial thrombus seen on CT abdomen. The patient's mental status will be closely monitored, and further evaluation with MRI may be necessary if the patient is unable to awaken and arouse fully.

The patient's skin integrity is also impaired, with erythema noted on her extremities.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and further deterioration can lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is critical, and further deterioration can lead to cardiac complications such as cardiac arrest or heart failure.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is concerning, and further deterioration can lead to neurological complications such as stroke or seizures.
4. Skin complications: The patient's skin integrity is impaired, and further deterioration can lead to skin complications such as pressure ulcers or skin infections.
5. Infections: The patient's suspected right-sided infiltrate pneumonia and possible extrapulmonary shunting increase the risk of infections, which can lead to further complications.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, neurological, and skin status. Further evaluation and treatment will be necessary to address the patient's suspected pneumonia, atrial thrombus, and altered mental status."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 79 yo female with multiple medical problems presents with hypoxia,
   tachypnea, pna by CXR, pyuria, and was intubated.
   .
   # s/p cardiac arrest: Cause for arrest unclear, but likely related to
   an ischemic event in the setting of [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6440**] or AV vegetation embolizing
   distally given ECHO findings yesterday and Rapidly elevated lactate.
   Picture and timecourse is not consistent with sepsis.  Could have
   mesenteric ischemia or micro thrombi to small vessels throughout.  PE
   is also possible given hypoxia this morning, hypotension, and arrest.
   - Q4H labs & more frequent monitoring of ABGs to evaluate oxygenation
   and acid/base status.
   - CT torso with CTA chest to evaluate for mesenteric ischemia (if
   positive would consider referral to surgery for management and addition
   of flagyl to cover for infection due to bowel microbes) and pulmonary
   embolism
   - CT head to evaluate for hemorrhage and septic emboli
   - Cont. supportive treatment
   - Hold metoprolol
   .
   # Resp failure: Initially, most likely [**12-22**] to perfusion barrier from
   pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 60**] have PE now as well (see above).
   - Decrease respiratory rate to 24 and attempt to keep pH > 7.25; after
   CT scans will try to decrease FiO2.
   - treatment from pna as below
   .
   # PNA: Right mid zone pna shown on CXR.  Pt has significant health care
   contact and last admission w/in 6 months, increasing her risk for
   resistant organisms.  Legionella urinary antigen negative.  Other micro
   studies are still pending.
   - vanc, cefepime, levo (she is PCN allergic) for healthcare associated
   pna, atypicals, and pseudomonas
   - nasal aspirate for flu, droplet precautions
   .
   # Pyuria: UCx negative.  Has had pan sensitive proteus and ecoli in
   past.   Will continue to follow UCx
   .
   # Atrial thrombus: Uncertain to what degree patient has been
   therapeutic on INR recently.  Per OMR records, pt. mostly therapeutic
   or supertherapeutic, though per family, not so much.  Also has history
   of mesenteric thrombus and has thrombosed anterior division of left
   internal iliac artery by CT abd on admission.  Patient received
   warfarin 3 mg last night.
   - hold warfarin d/t supratherapeutic INR.
   - trend INR and restart warfarin when lower or switch to heparin
   depending on information gained in above work-up
   - consider hypercoagulable workup (discuss with PCP)
   - may need long term lovenox
   .
   # AMS: most likely toxic metabolic, but given hypercoagulable history
   and clot present in her atrium, stroke is possible.  Unable to
   completely assess neurologic exam and ED exams do not document
   deficits.
   - recheck CT head for bleed & strokes given cardiac arrest and
   potential for embolism.
   - definitive study for embolic stoke would be MRI
   .
   # Renal failure: Resolved, back to baseline < 1.4.  Likely prerenal
   etiology, based on FEUrea and response to IVF.
   .
   # HOCM/diastolic CHF: mild CHF by CXR.  No elevated JVD, though she has
   LE edema.  BNP 7479, mildly elevated.  Previously always >3000 and has
   been up to 11,000.
   - Small fluid boluses with frequent monitoring to prevent volume
   overload.
   .
   # LE erythema: likely chronic venous stasis changes though cellulitis
   is in the differential and pink color is striking.  Seen by dermatology
   with similar description, thought to be chronic venous stasis.
   - vanc as above
   .
   # Afib: RVR with rates 100-120s.  Jxn'al rhythm documented by EKG as
   well - regular, which has some characteristics of digoxin toxicity,
   however digoxin is not on her med list and is not detected in her
   blood.  Although metoprolol is on her regular home regimen, her heart
   rate decreased little in response to it yesterday.
   - Will hold metoprolol for now given that she is ventricularly paced
   and continue to monitor telemetry.
   - Cont. arterial line for better BP monitoring.
   .
   # Abd pain: CT abd negative. GGT and AP both elevated mildly.  Amylase
   & lipase wnl.   No obvious explanation, but could have had transient
   mesenteric ischemia given her history.
   - repeat CT abd/pelvis as above
   - flagyl if evidence of bowel ischemia & surgical consultation
   - bowel regimen
   .
   # HTN: No currently hypertensive and she is infected with sepsis
   (though not currently shock)
   - hold antihypertensives
   .
   # DM: holding NPH, SSI for now as her requirements will likely be
   different from home.
   .
   # Gout: will hold allopurinol for now to reduce any side effects
   .
   # Glaucoma: cont eye drops
   .
   # Chronic low back pain: pain control prn
   .
   # FEN: NPO currently, will restart tube feeds later today if stable;
   Nutrition consult requested; repleting lytes prn
   .
   # Access: radial arterial line, PIV, femoral line (needs to be removed
   & new central line placed today)
   .
   # PPx: INR therapeutic (holding warfarin currently), bowel regimen, H2
   blocker
   .
   # Code: presumed full; daughter informed of cardiac arrest this morning
   and will be coming later this morning.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Echo showed severe diastolic failure, atrial thrombi, small aortic
   valve vegetation
   -Reportedly pt. not therapeutic on INR for awhile
   -Pt. tachycardic to 120s-130s and lopressor titrated upward
   -Pt began dropping SBP to 70s, MAPS 60-70, after IV lopressor &
   bolussed 250 cc NS.  Abtout 3 hours later UOP began decreasing, still
   tachycardic with similar BPs & bolussed another 250 cc NS.  Then
   rapidly became hypotensive with cool extremities, PEA arrest, got chest
   compressions then was in Vtach, shocked x1 restored to perfusing rhythm
   with ventricular pacing.  Fem line placed, started levophed then
   neosynephrine added.  2 amps NaHCO3 given plus IVF boluses.  Patient
   hyperventilated on vent.  Lactate and K+ rapidly elevated.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple medical problems who was admitted to the ICU due to hypoxia, tachypnea, and pneumonia. The patient had a cardiac arrest this morning, which was likely related to an ischemic event or AV vegetation embolizing distally.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tachycardic, hypotensive, and hypoxemic
* Respiratory support: On mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 10 cmH2O
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Radial arterial line and femoral line in place
* Fluid balance: Total fluid input of 1,612 mL, with a positive balance of 532 mL
* Laboratory results: Elevated lactate levels, elevated potassium levels, and decreased platelet count
* Imaging studies: CT torso with CTA chest pending, CT head pending

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

* Cardiac arrest: The patient had a cardiac arrest this morning, which was likely related to an ischemic event or AV vegetation embolizing distally. The patient is currently being monitored closely for any signs of recurrent cardiac arrest.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and her respiratory status is being closely monitored. The patient's oxygenation and ventilation status will be reassessed regularly to determine if further interventions are needed.
* Renal failure: The patient's renal function is currently normal, but the patient's creatinine level is elevated. The patient's renal function will be closely monitored to determine if further interventions are needed.
* Hypercoagulable state: The patient has a history of hypercoagulable states, and the patient's INR is currently elevated. The patient's INR will be closely monitored to determine if further interventions are needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 79 yo female with multiple medical problems presents with hypoxia,
   tachypnea, pna by CXR, pyuria, and was intubated.
   .
   # Resp failure: Most likely [**12-22**] to perfusion barrier from pneumonia.
   Other possible etiologies include pulmonary edema, aspiration.
   - ventilation, wean as tolerated
 switch to PS and decrease FiO2,
   increase PEEP if difficult
   - treatment from pna as below
   - diagnosis/treatment for CHF as below
   - vent bundle/precautions
   - radial arterial line for BP monitoring
   .
   # PNA: Right mid zone pna shown on CXR.  Pt has significant health care
   contact and last admission w/in 6 months, increasing her risk for
   resistant organisms.
   - vanc, cefepime, levo (she is PCN allergic) for healthcare associated
   pna, atypicals, and pseudomonas
   - nasal aspirate for flu, droplet precautions
   - legionella urinary antigen
   .
   # Pyuria: UCx pending.  has had pan sensitive proteus and ecoli in
   past.
   - antibiotics as per pna coverage (cefepime and levo should cover)
   - follow UCx
   .
   # Atrial thrombus: Has been mostly therapeutic or supertherapeutic
   recently.  Also has history of mesenteric thrombus and has thrombosed
   anterior division of left internal iliac artery by CT abd today.  This
   is suggestive of an underlying hypercoagulable state and if she has not
   already had one, she should have a hypercoagulable workup.
   - IV heparin (hold coumadin) pending CT head as below and as bridge
   when INR lowers
   - may need long term lovenox
   - discuss with PCP whether she has had hypercoagulable workup at
   another hospital.  If not, Hematology consult and workup for
   thrombophilia.
   - ECHO today
   .
   # AMS: most likely toxic metabolic, but given hypercoagulable history
   and clot present in her atrium, stroke is possible.  Unable to
   completely assess neurologic exam and ED exams do not document
   defecits.
   - CT head for bleed before starting heparin as above
   - definitive study for embolic stoke would be MRI if concerned about
   embolic stroke
   .
   # Renal failure: Resolved, back to baseline < 1.4.  Likely prerenal
   etiology, based on FEUrea and response to IVF.
   .
   # HOCM/diastolic CHF: mild CHF by CXR.  No elevated JVD, though she has
   LE edema.  BNP 7479, mildly elevated.  Previously always >3000 and has
   been up to 11,000.
   - ECHO
   .
   # LE erythema: likely chronic venous stasis changes though cellulitis
   is in the differential and pink color is striking.  Seen by dermatology
   with similar description, thought to be chronic venous stasis.
   - vanc as above
   .
   # Afib: RVR with rates 100-120s.  Jxn'al rhythm documented by EKG as
   well - regular, which has some characteristics of digoxin toxicity,
   however digoxin is not on her med list and is not detected in her
   blood.
   - arterial line for better BP monitoring.
   - metoprolol IV push to see how she responds, then short acting PO if
   good response.
   .
   # Abd pain: CT abd negative. GGT and AP both elevated mildly.  Amylase
   & lipase wnl.   No obvious explanation, but could have had transient
   mesenteric ischemia given her history.
   - bowel regimen
   .
   # HTN: No currently hypertensive and she is infected with sepsis
   (though not currently shock)
   - hold antihypertensives
   .
   # DM: holding NPH, SSI for now as her requirements will likely be
   different from home.
   .
   # Gout: will hold allopurinol for now to reduce any side effects
   .
   # Glaucoma: cont eye drops
   .
   # Chronic low back pain: pain control prn
   .
   # FEN: NPO currently, will start tube feeds and request nutrition
   consult; replete lytes prn
   .
   # Access: radial arterial line, PIV
   .
   # PPx: INR therapeutic, bowel regimen, H2 blocker (holding warfarin
   currently, will start heparin when INR drops)
   .
   # Code: presumed full
   .
   # Dispo: ICU

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   anterior division of left internal iliac artery by CT abd today.  This
   is suggestive of an underlying hypercoagulable state and if she has not
   already had one, she should have a hypercoagulable workup.
   - IV heparin (hold coumadin) pending CT head as below and as bridge
   when INR lowers
   - may need long term lovenox
   - discuss with PCP whether she has had hypercoagulable workup at
   another hospital.  If not, Hematology consult and workup for
   thrombophilia.
   - ECHO today
   .
   # AMS: most likely toxic metabolic, but given hypercoagulable history
   and clot present in her atrium, stroke is possible.  Unable to
   completely assess neurologic exam and ED exams do not document
   defecits.
   - CT head for bleed before starting heparin as above
   - definitive study for embolic stoke would be MRI if concerned about
   embolic stroke
   .
   # Renal failure: Resolved, back to baseline < 1.4.  Likely prerenal
   etiology, based on FEUrea and response to IVF.
   .
   # HOCM/diastolic CHF: mild CHF by CXR.  No elevated JVD, though she has
   LE edema.  BNP 7479, mildly elevated.  Previously always >3000 and has
   been up to 11,000.
   - ECHO
   .
   # LE erythema: likely chronic venous stasis changes though cellulitis
   is in the differential and pink color is striking.  Seen by dermatology
   with similar description, thought to be chronic venous stasis.
   - vanc as above
   .
   # Afib: RVR with rates 100-120s.  Jxn'al rhythm documented by EKG as
   well - regular, which has some characteristics of digoxin toxicity,
   however digoxin is not on her med list and is not detected in her
   blood.
   - arterial line for better BP monitoring.
   - metoprolol IV push to see how she responds, then short acting PO if
   good response.
   .
   # Abd pain: CT abd negative. GGT and AP both elevated mildly.  Amylase
   & lipase wnl.   No obvious explanation, but could have had transient
   mesenteric ischemia given her history.
   - bowel regimen
   .
   # HTN: No currently hypertensive and she is infected with sepsis
   (though not currently shock)
   - hold antihypertensives
   .
   # DM: holding NPH, SSI for now as her requirements will likely be
   different from home.
   .
   # Gout: will hold allopurinol for now to reduce any side effects

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including atrial fibrillation, hypercoagulable state, and a history of mesenteric thrombus. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia, tachypnea, and pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory failure: Most likely due to a perfusion barrier from pneumonia, with a possible etiology of pulmonary edema or aspiration.
* Pneumonia: Right mid-zone pneumonia is evident on CXR, with a high risk of resistant organisms due to her recent healthcare contact and previous admission within 6 months.
* Pyuria: The patient has a history of pan-sensitive Proteus and E. coli infections, and UCx pending.
* Atrial thrombus: The patient has a history of thrombosis in the anterior division of the left internal iliac artery and has a hypercoagulable state, which may require long-term anticoagulation therapy.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactate level is 4.9, indicating a severe metabolic acidosis.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has resolved, and she is back to baseline.

The patient's current medications include:

* Fentanyl 25 mcg/hour
* Midazolam (Versed) 2 mg/hour
* Metoprolol IV push
* IV heparin (hold coumadin)
* Vanc, cefepime, and levo (for healthcare-associated pneumonia)
* Nasal aspirate for flu
* Droplet precautions
* Legionella urinary antigen

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Ventilation: Wean as tolerated, switch to PS and decrease FiO2, and increase PEEP if necessary.
* Pneumonia treatment: Vanc, cefepime, and levo for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
* Atrial thrombus treatment: IV heparin (hold coumadin) pending CT head and as bridge when INR lowers.
* Metabolic acidosis treatment: Lactic acid level is 4.9, indicating a severe metabolic acidosis.
* Renal failure treatment: Resolved, back to baseline < 1.4.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: Pneumonia may worsen, and the patient may require more aggressive ventilation.
* Pneumonia: The patient may develop resistant organisms, which may require more aggressive antibiotics.
* Atrial thrombus: The patient may develop a stroke or other embolic events if not properly treated.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient may develop further metabolic acidosis if not properly treated.
* Renal failure: The patient may develop further renal failure if not properly treated.

In conclusion, the patient is a high-risk patient with multiple medical problems, including atrial fibrillation, hypercoagulable state, and a history of mesenteric thrombus. She requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple comorbidities and complications. The patient's chief complaint is atrial fibrillation (AFib), respiratory failure, altered mental status, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 80/63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The patient's respiratory support is also compromised, with a respiratory rate of 22 inspirations per minute and a respiratory system compliance of 45.

The patient's laboratory results indicate severe anemia (Hct 42.3%), thrombocytopenia (Plt 296), and elevated lactate levels (1.9 mmol/L). The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the patient has a history of hypercoagulable events.

The patient's medical history includes aortic valve vegetation, atrial thrombi, and small aortic valve vegetation, which may be contributing to the patient's hemodynamic instability.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: Atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, and cardiac failure can lead to cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: Respiratory failure, acute lung injury, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) can lead to respiratory distress, respiratory failure, and sepsis.
3. Hemorrhagic complications: Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy can lead to bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and postoperative bleeding.
4. Infection complications: Bacterial sepsis, endocarditis, and septic shock can arise from the patient's underlying medical conditions and hypercoagulable state.
5. Neurological complications: Altered mental status, seizures, and stroke can occur due to cardiac and respiratory instability, as well as underlying neurological conditions.
6. Renal complications: Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) can arise from the patient's underlying medical conditions, sepsis, and medications.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: Gastrointestinal bleeding, ileus, and sepsis can occur due to the patient's underlying medical conditions and medications.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to anticipate and prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo female with severe diastolic heart failure and admit with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and concern for pneumonia based on
   initial imaging.  Overnight she evolved significant impairment in
   perfusion with acute evolution of lactic acidosis and significant anion
   gap acidosis.  This acute change represented primarily by evolution of
   severe anion Gap acidosis is most concerning for embolic insult perhaps
   from known [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6439**] in the setting of anticoagulation.  This
   combined with severe impairment in cardiac function may well be
   contributing to severe impairment in perfusion and acute worsening of
   lactic acidosis.  PEA arrest was likely a combination of
   Acidemia/Hyperkalemia and impaired cardiac function.
   1)Cardiac Arrest
PEA arrest
   -K+ to be corrected and has decreased to 5.2
   -Repeat ECHO to eval for thrombus migration and/or vegetation migration
   if therapeutic plan to be altered by it as good image obtained
   yesterday
   -Will need to stabilze academia with both addressing of the underlying
   insult and maintenance of mild hyperventilation
   -For recurrent PEA arrest would have to consider empiric thrombolysis
   if alternative causes controlled.
   2)Lactic Acidosis
This is concerning for thrombo-embolic insult with
   possible bowel insult or even LE insult given asymmetric pulses in left
   LE.  Will need urgent images to define source with PE possible as well
   given PEA arrest although coumadin was therapeutic
   -CTA now
   -CT chest/abd to eval for acute insult
   -Will need flow study of LLE to evaluate for possible peripheral
   arterial occlusion
   -Continue with pressor support/IVF and will need CVL change
   -INR=3 with Coumadin 3mg given and will utilize heparin
   3)Respiratory Failure
likely secondary to insults above but possibility
   triggered by pneumonia based on initial findings on CXR suggesting an
   infiltrate and is on treatment for hospital acquired pneumonia
   Vanco/Cefepime/Levofloxacin
   -Decrease respiratory rate to 24
   -Wean FIO2 by PaO2
   -Maintain PEEP
   4)Congestive Heart Failure
Diastolic and chronic with acute
   decompensation
   -Will keep HR <100 if at all possible
   -CK and Troponin
   -Bolus as needed for hypotension only
   -If hemodynamics need to be better understood would consider SG
   catheter given complex insult of possible CHF, obstructive shock with
   PE and possible peripheral insult with ischemia distally.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo female with severe diastolic heart failure and admit with
   hypoxemic respiratory failure and concern for pneumonia based on
   initial imaging.  Overnight she evolved significant impairment in
   perfusion with acute evolution of lactic acidosis and significant anion
   gap acidosis.  This acute change represented primarily by evolution of
   severe anion Gap acidosis is most concerning for embolic insult perhaps
   from known [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 6439**] in the setting of anticoagulation.  This
   combined with severe impairment in cardiac function may well be
   contributing to severe impairment in perfusion and acute worsening of
   lactic acidosis.  PEA arrest was likely a combination of
   Acidemia/Hyperkalemia and impaired cardiac function.
   1)Cardiac Arrest
PEA arrest
   -K+ to be corrected and has decreased to 5.2
   -Repeat ECHO to eval for thrombus migration and/or vegetation migration
   if therapeutic plan to be altered by it as good image obtained
   yesterday
   -Will need to stabilze academia with both addressing of the underlying
   insult and maintenance of mild hyperventilation
   -For recurrent PEA arrest would have to consider empiric thrombolysis
   if alternative causes controlled.
   2)Lactic Acidosis
This is concerning for thrombo-embolic insult with
   possible bowel insult or even LE insult given asymmetric pulses in left
   LE.  Will need urgent images to define source with PE possible as well
   given PEA arrest although coumadin was therapeutic
   -CTA now
   -CT chest/abd to eval for acute insult
   -Will need flow study of LLE to evaluate for possible peripheral
   arterial occlusion
   -Continue with pressor support/IVF and will need CVL change
   -INR=3 with Coumadin 3mg given and will utilize heparin
   3)Respiratory Failure
likely secondary to insults above but possibility
   triggered by pneumonia based on initial findings on CXR suggesting an
   infiltrate and is on treatment for hospital acquired pneumonia
   Vanco/Cefepime/Levofloxacin
   -Decrease respiratory rate to 24
   -Wean FIO2 by PaO2
   -Maintain PEEP
   4)Congestive Heart Failure
Diastolic and chronic with acute
   decompensation
   -Will keep HR <100 if at all possible
   -CK and Troponin
   -Bolus as needed for hypotension only
   -If hemodynamics need to be better understood would consider SG
   catheter given complex insult of possible CHF, obstructive shock with
   PE and possible peripheral insult with ischemia distally.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old female admitted with severe diastolic heart failure, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and concern for pneumonia. The patient has undergone significant changes overnight, including cardiac arrest, lactic acidosis, and severe impairment in perfusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this situation include:

1. Recurrent PEA arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest may recur due to ongoing acidemia, hyperkalemia, and impaired cardiac function. Empiric thrombolysis may be considered if alternative causes are controlled.
2. Thromboembolic insult: The patient's lactic acidosis and PEA arrest may be related to a thromboembolic insult, which could be further complicated by bowel or left lower extremity (LLE) insult. Urgent imaging is necessary to define the source of the insult.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's lactic acidosis and hypoperfusion may lead to acute kidney injury, which could further complicate the patient's condition.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to ongoing insults, including pneumonia, and the need for mechanical ventilation.
5. Congestive heart failure: The patient's diastolic heart failure may worsen due to ongoing decompensation, which could lead to further impairment in cardiac function and perfusion.
6. Skin integrity issues: The patient's impaired skin integrity may worsen due to ongoing hypoperfusion and potential skin breakdown.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may worsen due to ongoing hypoxemia, acidemia, and potential cerebral edema.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care should be focused on:

1. Stabilizing academia with correction of acidemia and hyperkalemia.
2. Addressing the underlying causes of lactic acidosis, including thromboembolic insult, bowel or LLE insult, and potential peripheral arterial occlusion.
3. Continuing pressor support and IVF to maintain perfusion.
4. Weaning FIO2 and maintaining PEEP to optimize respiratory support.
5. Monitoring and managing congestive heart failure, including maintaining a heart rate <100 and controlling blood pressure.
6. Maintaining glycemic control and monitoring for signs of skin breakdown.
7. Monitoring for neurological complications and addressing any potential cerebral edema."
