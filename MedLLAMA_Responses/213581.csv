   ECG: .
   Assessment
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely AMI given enzymes still up and likely short (relatively for
   myocardium) hypoxia. Likely STEMI. Possibly followed by VF arrest. PE
   unlikely based on echo and presentation, EKG, enzymes.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin, and heparin gtt
   - obtain am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   - follow cardiac biomarkers
   - Initiate cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr, cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1580**])
      *start paralytics with Cisatracurium Besylate for shivering,
   continue fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Chem 7, CBC, INR, tox screen - pending
   Mental Status
   No evidence of sensory evoked potenials. Areflexia likely due to
   paralysis or, less likely,
spinal shock
. Sedation may also be
   responsible for lack of EEG activity. Will keep paralytics off and wean
   sedation as warming today to further evaluate neurologic status. Will
   need more time to prognosticate.
   - Neurologic exam this afternoon after paralytics off for longer and
   sedation weaned
   - Appeciate Neurology input
   - Rewarm and continue EEG monitoring
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Drawing large tidal volumes
   prior to paralysis. Paralytics kept on to facilitate mechanical
   ventilation. Found to have unclear opacities on CXR which may be blood,
   sputum, or edema.
   - ventalation weaned to FiO2 50%, will recheck ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
   - continue antibiotics with unasyn for aspiration coverage, consider
   stopping vanc
   - Q 6 mouth care
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   - continue nitro gtt as needed
   - 5 mg IV lopressor Q 6 Hr
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking POs
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA
   - f/u culture
   - continue unasyn as above
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place but will be NPO while on paralytics
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin gtt
   -Pain management with fentanyl
   -ppi with famotidine
   -Bowel regimen with docusate, senna when taking PO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

      *continuous EEG x 48 hr, cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1580**])
      *start paralytics with Cisatracurium Besylate for shivering,
   continue fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Chem 7, CBC, INR, tox screen - pending
   Mental Status
   No evidence of sensory evoked potenials. Areflexia likely due to
   paralysis or, less likely,
spinal shock
. Sedation may also be
   responsible for lack of EEG activity. Will keep paralytics off and wean
   sedation as warming today to further evaluate neurologic status. Will
   need more time to prognosticate.
   - Neurologic exam this afternoon after paralytics off for longer and
   sedation weaned
   - Appeciate Neurology input
   - Rewarm and continue EEG monitoring
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Drawing large tidal volumes
   prior to paralysis. Paralytics kept on to facilitate mechanical
   ventilation. Found to have unclear opacities on CXR which may be blood,
   sputum, or edema.
   - ventalation weaned to FiO2 50%, will recheck ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
   - continue antibiotics with unasyn for aspiration coverage, consider
   stopping vanc
   - Q 6 mouth care
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   - continue nitro gtt as needed
   - 5 mg IV lopressor Q 6 Hr
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking POs
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man who suffered a cardiorespiratory arrest and was successfully resuscitated. He was intubated and placed on a cooling protocol due to his poor neurological exam and concern for hypoxic brain injury. The patient has a history of cardiac arrest with subsequent cardiac enzyme leak, and his electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST elevations, which are consistent with a myocardial infarction (MI).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* He is intubated and mechanically ventilated with a FiO2 of 50% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
* His blood pressure is controlled with dopamine and lopressor, and his heart rate is 66 beats per minute (bpm).
* His neurological exam is poor, with no spontaneous behavior, no response to pain, and no papillary response.
* He has a GCS of 3, with no EEG desynchronization noted.
* His laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes, including troponin-T and CK-MB, which are consistent with a recent MI.
* His blood cultures are pending, and he has a sputum Gram stain that shows gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
* He has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being treated with antibiotics.
* He has a history of hypertension and is being treated with antihypertensive medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's poor neurological exam and concern for hypoxic brain injury make it important to closely monitor his cardiac status and prevent further cardiac complications.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's mechanical ventilation and high FiO2 may increase his risk of respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
* Neurological complications: The patient's poor neurological exam and lack of EEG desynchronization make it important to closely monitor his neurological status and prevent further neurological complications.
* Infection: The patient's UTI and sputum Gram stain that shows gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters make it important to closely monitor his infection status and prevent further infections.
* Hypertension: The patient's hypertension and treatment with antihypertensive medications make it important to closely monitor his blood pressure and prevent further hypertension-related complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is recommended that he continue to receive close monitoring and treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) and that his care team closely follow his progress and adjust his treatment plan as needed."

   Assessment
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   .
   * Cardiac Arrest:  Differential diagnosis for sudden arrest includes
   MI, massive PE, cardiac tampenade, arrhythmia, metabolic derrangement,
   toxicosis.  Given ST elevations in inferior distribution on EKGs by EMS
   and elevated CKMB, MI causing V fib arrest seems most likely etiology.
   PE causing PEA arrest and subsequent hypoperfusion leading to V fib
   aslo a possibility, but lack of right heart strain on echo does not
   support this.
   -- Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin, and heparin gtt
   -- obtain am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   -- follow cardiac biomarkers
   -- Formal Echo in am
   -- Initiate cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr, cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1580**])
      *start paralytics with Cisatracurium Besylate for shivering,
   continue fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   -- Chem 7, CBC, INR, tox screen - pending
   -- chest x ray
   -- will hold on obtaining CTA chest to r/o PE, given would not change
   current management
   -- obtain arterial line for BP monitoring - done in ED
   -- will consider central venous line if hemodynamically unstable
   -- Will consider catheterization if neurologically improves
   .
   * Status post intubation for respiratory protection:  Initially
   intubated for airway protection.  Found to have unclear opacities on
   CXR which may be blood, sputum, or edema.
   -- ventalation weaned to FiO2 50%, will recheck ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   -- fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
   -- continue antibiotics with unasyn for aspiration coverage, consider
   stopping vanc
   -- Q 6 mouth care
   .
   * Hypertension: Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250.
   Has known hypertension, per wife but not on any antihypertensive
   medications at home.  Unusual to have hypertension in the setting of
   MI, but may have increased catecholamines after resucitation.
   -- continue nitro gtt as needed
   -- 5 mg IV lopressor Q 6 Hr
   -- will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under
   better control and taking POs
   .
   * Neurologic unresponsiveness:  Found to have decorticate posturing at
   OSH.  Did not have pupillary or gag reflexes in ED.
   -- continue cooling protocol with 48 hr EEG
   -- f/u with neurology

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   .
   * Cardiac Arrest:  Differential diagnosis for sudden arrest includes
   MI, massive PE, cardiac tampenade, arrhythmia, metabolic derrangement,
   toxicosis.  Given ST elevations in inferior distribution on EKGs by EMS
   and elevated CKMB, MI causing V fib arrest seems most likely etiology.
   PE causing PEA arrest and subsequent hypoperfusion leading to V fib
   aslo a possibility, but lack of right heart strain on echo does not
   support this.
   -- Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin, and heparin gtt
   -- obtain am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   -- follow cardiac biomarkers
   -- Formal Echo in am
   -- Initiate cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr, cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1580**])
      *start paralytics with Cisatracurium Besylate for shivering,
   continue fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   -- Chem 7, CBC, INR, tox screen - pending
   -- chest x ray
   -- will hold on obtaining CTA chest to r/o PE, given would not change
   current management
   -- obtain arterial line for BP monitoring - done in ED
   -- will consider central venous line if hemodynamically unstable
   -- Will consider catheterization if neurologically improves
   .
   * Status post intubation for respiratory protection:  Initially
   intubated for airway protection.  Found to have unclear opacities on
   CXR which may be blood, sputum, or edema.
   -- ventalation weaned to FiO2 50%, will recheck ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   -- fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
   -- continue antibiotics with unasyn for aspiration coverage, consider
   stopping vanc
   -- Q 6 mouth care
   .
   * Hypertension: Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250.
   Has known hypertension, per wife but not on any antihypertensive
   medications at home.  Unusual to have hypertension in the setting of
   MI, but may have increased catecholamines after resucitation.
   -- continue nitro gtt as needed
   -- 5 mg IV lopressor Q 6 Hr
   -- will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under
   better control and taking POs
   .
   * Neurologic unresponsiveness:  Found to have decorticate posturing at
   OSH.  Did not have pupillary or gag reflexes in ED.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male who presented to the hospital after a cardiac arrest, requiring defibrillation twice. The patient has no past medical history or recent medical care, but was found to have resolution of ST elevations on EKG, but poor neurological exam.

The patient's current status is:

* Cardiac arrest: The differential diagnosis includes MI, massive PE, cardiac tamponade, arrhythmia, metabolic derangement, and toxicosis. Given the ST elevations in inferior distribution on EKG and elevated CKMB, MI causing V fib arrest seems the most likely etiology.
* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated for airway protection and is being ventilated with FiO2 50%. The goal is to wean the ventilation and recheck ABG (goal CO2 < 40).
* Neurological status: The patient is neurologically unresponsive, with decorticate posturing and no pupillary or gag reflexes.
* Hypertension: The patient has known hypertension, but was not on any antihypertensive medications at home. The blood pressure is currently above 250, which may be due to increased catecholamines after resuscitation.
* UTI: The patient has moderate bacteria seen on UA and is being treated with Unasyn.
* Cooling protocol: The patient is being cooled to 33.5°C for 24 hours, with continuous EEG monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest may lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac tamponade.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's intubation and ventilation may lead to respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), respiratory failure, or pneumothorax.
* Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is poor, and further neurological complications, such as cerebral edema, intracranial hemorrhage, or sepsis-induced encephalopathy, may arise.
* Sepsis: The patient's UTI and potential aspiration may lead to sepsis, which can cause organ dysfunction, including cardiac, respiratory, and renal failure.
* DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and the use of heparin gtt for prophylaxis.
* Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to the use of paralytics and sedation.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent these complications and improve the patient's outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critical care patient in the ICU with a history of cardiorespiratory arrest, cardiac enzyme leak, and subsequent cardiac dysfunction. The patient's current status is as follows:

* Cardiovascular: The patient has a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50% with hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls. The patient is receiving dopamine infusion to support blood pressure.
* Respiratory: The patient is mechanically ventilated with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and an FiO2 of 50%. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100%.
* Neurological: The patient's neurological status is not assessed due to the patient's sedation.
* Hemodynamic: The patient's blood pressure is 101/56 mmHg, and the patient is receiving fluid support.
* Laboratory: The patient's troponin-T level is 0.77 ng/mL, and the patient's creatine kinase (CK) level is 1861 U/L, indicating cardiac injury. The patient's white blood cell count is 6.8 K/uL, and the patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 20 mg/dL.
* Imaging: The patient's CT head and neck showed no bleed.
* Microbiology: The patient's sputum Gram stain shows gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, and blood and urine cultures are pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current status include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac enzyme leak and cardiac dysfunction increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and high FiO2 requirements increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's cardiac enzyme leak and cardiac dysfunction increase the risk of sepsis, particularly with the presence of gram-positive cocci in the sputum.
4. Renal failure: The patient's cardiac dysfunction and fluid overload increase the risk of renal failure.
5. Bleeding: The patient's cardiac enzyme leak and cardiac dysfunction increase the risk of bleeding, particularly with the use of anticoagulant therapy.
6. Infection: The patient's cardiac enzyme leak and cardiac dysfunction increase the risk of infection, particularly with the presence of gram-positive cocci in the sputum.
7. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's cardiac enzyme leak and cardiac dysfunction increase the risk of cardiac tamponade, particularly with the presence of hypokinesis of the inferior and posterior walls.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's cardiac function, respiratory status, and laboratory results to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely AMI given enzymes still up and likely short (relatively for
   myocardium) hypoxia. Likely STEMI. Possibly followed by VF arrest. PE
   unlikely based on echo and presentation, EKG, enzymes.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin, and heparin gtt
   - obtain am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   - follow cardiac biomarkers
   - Initiate cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr, cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1580**])
      *start paralytics with Cisatracurium Besylate for shivering,
   continue fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Chem 7, CBC, INR, tox screen - pending
   Mental Status
   No evidence of sensory evoked potenials. Areflexia likely due to
   paralysis or, less likely,
spinal shock
. Sedation may also be
   responsible for lack of EEG activity. Will keep paralytics off and wean
   sedation as warming today to further evaluate neurologic status.
   - Neurologic exam this afternoon after paralytics off for longer and
   sedation weaned
   - Appeciate Neurology input
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Drawing large tidal volumes
   prior to paralysis. Paralytics kept on to facilitate mechanical
   ventilation. Found to have unclear opacities on CXR which may be blood,
   sputum, or edema.
   - ventalation weaned to FiO2 50%, will recheck ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
   - continue antibiotics with unasyn for aspiration coverage, consider
   stopping vanc
   - Q 6 mouth care
   .
   * Hypertension: Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250.
   Has known hypertension, per wife but not on any antihypertensive
   medications at home.  Unusual to have hypertension in the setting of
   MI, but may have increased catecholamines after resucitation.
   -- continue nitro gtt as needed
   -- 5 mg IV lopressor Q 6 Hr
   -- will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under
   better control and taking POs
   .
   * Neurologic unresponsiveness:  Found to have decorticate posturing at
   OSH.  Did not have pupillary or gag reflexes in ED.
   -- continue cooling protocol with 48 hr EEG
   -- f/u with neurology
   -- continue sedation and paralysis
   .
   * UTI: moderate bacteria seen on UA
   -- f/u culture
   -- continue unasyn as above
   .
   * FEN/GI:  Has OG tube in place but will be NPO while on paralytics
   -- famotidine IV Q 12

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely AMI given enzymes still up and likely short (relatively for
   myocardium) hypoxia. Likely STEMI. Possibly followed by VF arrest. PE
   unlikely based on echo and presentation, EKG, enzymes.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin, and heparin gtt
   - obtain am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   - follow cardiac biomarkers
   - Initiate cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr, cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs ([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 77**] [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7916**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1580**])
      *start paralytics with Cisatracurium Besylate for shivering,
   continue fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Chem 7, CBC, INR, tox screen - pending
   Mental Status
   No evidence of sensory evoked potenials. Areflexia likely due to
   paralysis or, less likely,
spinal shock
. Sedation may also be
   responsible for lack of EEG activity. Will keep paralytics off and wean
   sedation as warming today to further evaluate neurologic status.
   - Neurologic exam this afternoon after paralytics off for longer and
   sedation weaned
   - Appeciate Neurology input
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Drawing large tidal volumes
   prior to paralysis. Paralytics kept on to facilitate mechanical
   ventilation. Found to have unclear opacities on CXR which may be blood,
   sputum, or edema.
   - ventalation weaned to FiO2 50%, will recheck ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - fentanyl/midazolam for sedation and pain control
   - continue antibiotics with unasyn for aspiration coverage, consider
   stopping vanc
   - Q 6 mouth care
   .
   * Hypertension: Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250.
   Has known hypertension, per wife but not on any antihypertensive
   medications at home.  Unusual to have hypertension in the setting of
   MI, but may have increased catecholamines after resucitation.
   -- continue nitro gtt as needed
   -- 5 mg IV lopressor Q 6 Hr
   -- will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under
   better control and taking POs
   .
   * Neurologic unresponsiveness:  Found to have decorticate posturing at
   OSH.  Did not have pupillary or gag reflexes in ED.
   -- continue cooling protocol with 48 hr EEG
   -- f/u with neurology
   -- continue sedation and paralysis
   .
   * UTI: moderate bacteria seen on UA
   -- f/u culture
   -- continue unasyn as above

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a cardiorespiratory arrest, requiring defibrillation twice. He was found to have ST elevations on EKG by EMS and OSH, and was transferred for further management. He is currently on a cooling protocol due to suspected cardiac arrest. He has a poor neurological exam, with no pupillary response, no EEG activity, and areflexia.

The patient has a history of hypertension, but is not on any antihypertensive medications. He has a moderate bacteria growth on his urine analysis, and is being treated with antibiotics. He also has an OG tube in place, but will be NPO while on paralytics.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 101/56 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 100% on 50% FiO2. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's labs show elevated cardiac enzymes, with a troponin-T of 0.77 ng/mL, and a CK-MB of 76 U/L. His white blood cell count is 6.8 K/uL, and his lactate acid level is 1.5 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, suggesting a possible myocardial infarction. He is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's poor neurological exam suggests a high risk of neurological complications, such as brain death or persistent vegetative state.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated lung injury.
4. Infection: The patient has a moderate bacteria growth on his urine analysis, and is at risk for developing a urinary tract infection.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient is on anticoagulation therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Metabolic complications: The patient is at risk for developing metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia or electrolyte imbalances, due to his critical illness and treatment with paralytics and sedatives.

Recommendations:

1. Continue cooling protocol to prevent further neurological damage.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin-T levels to assess for any changes in cardiac function.
3. Continue antibiotics for urinary tract infection and monitor for any signs of sepsis.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation as needed to prevent respiratory complications.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust sedation and paralysis as needed to prevent further neurological damage.
6. Consider consulting with a cardiologist to assess the patient's cardiac function and recommend further treatment.
7. Consider consulting with a neurologist to assess the patient's neurological status and recommend further treatment."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2156-5-31**]
   - Paralytics turned off at about 4 or 5 a.m.
   - decreased sedation and warmed
   - Dopamine weaned off
   - Was acidotic on blood gas after warming. Appeared non-gap metabolic
   acidosis with imperfect respiratory compensation. Was some increase in
   pCO2 to 46 and acidotic, so figure that CO2 production increased with
   warming, so allowed patient to autoregulate on pressure support. ABG
   improved then switched to AC to rest again overnight with better ABGs.
   - Neuro exam after lightening of sedation, holding paralytics for 12
   hours and re-warming revealed sluggish corneal on left, absent on
   right, bilateral normal biceps reflexes, increased tone in legs with
   absent patella and plantar reflexes.  Later in evening was able to move
   all 4 extremities, but unclear if entirely purposeful.
   - Added beta-blocker 5 mg Lopressor IV q 6 h, but held early am doses
   due to hypotension
   - Was bolused 500 cc x 2 for low urine output (BP fine). Responded to
   first bolus but not so much for the second. Stop boluses as 7L+ LOS.
   FENa 0.4; FEUrea 26.5
   - Urine output fell off in afternoon then again in a.m. - bladder scan
   showed 900 cc - called Urology and tried their suggestions to no avail
   - they came and replaced with good urine output of about 1 liter
   - Patient sat up this a.m. and A-line split - quite some bleeding -
   A-line removed.

   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now approx 64 hrs post arrest.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trendind down
   - am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   Mental Status
   - Per cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr completed
 f/u with neuro
      * cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs
 has now been rewarmed (paralytics off
   since 5 am)
      *sedation also weaned
 neuro exam still showing defecits
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Appeciate Neurology input; will reach 72 hrs post arrest today for
   prognostication
   - Stop medazolam/fentanyl for neuro assessment today
   - continue propofol as needed for sedation, plan to turn off by 1:30 pm
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   yesterday, but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with
   respiratory compensation.  Was rested on AC overnight.  Chest x ray
   showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation.
   - try pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - continue antibiotics with azithromycin/ceftriaxone D #[**5-20**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned.
   - monitor BP,
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - listen for bowel sounds and when present initiate PO
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's
   - a line removed today after split caused bleeding
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin gtt
   -Pain management with fentanyl
   -ppi with famotidine
   -Bowel regimen with docusate, senna when taking PO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2156-5-31**]
   - Paralytics turned off at about 4 or 5 a.m.
   - decreased sedation and warmed
   - Dopamine weaned off
   - Was acidotic on blood gas after warming. Appeared non-gap metabolic
   acidosis with imperfect respiratory compensation. Was some increase in
   pCO2 to 46 and acidotic, so figure that CO2 production increased with
   warming, so allowed patient to autoregulate on pressure support. ABG
   improved then switched to AC to rest again overnight with better ABGs.
   - Neuro exam after lightening of sedation, holding paralytics for 12
   hours and re-warming revealed sluggish corneal on left, absent on
   right, bilateral normal biceps reflexes, increased tone in legs with
   absent patella and plantar reflexes.  Later in evening was able to move
   all 4 extremities, but unclear if entirely purposeful.
   - Added beta-blocker 5 mg Lopressor IV q 6 h, but held early am doses
   due to hypotension
   - Was bolused 500 cc x 2 for low urine output (BP fine). Responded to
   first bolus but not so much for the second. Stop boluses as 7L+ LOS.
   FENa 0.4; FEUrea 26.5
   - Urine output fell off in afternoon then again in a.m. - bladder scan
   showed 900 cc - called Urology and tried their suggestions to no avail
   - they came and replaced with good urine output of about 1 liter
   - Patient sat up this a.m. and A-line split - quite some bleeding -
   A-line removed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now approx 64 hrs post arrest.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trendind down
   - am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   Mental Status
   - Per cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr completed
 f/u with neuro
      * cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs
 has now been rewarmed (paralytics off
   since 5 am)
      *sedation also weaned
 neuro exam still showing defecits
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Appeciate Neurology input; will reach 72 hrs post arrest today for
   prognostication
   - Stop medazolam/fentanyl for neuro assessment today
   - continue propofol as needed for sedation, plan to turn off by 1:30 pm
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   yesterday, but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with
   respiratory compensation.  Was rested on AC overnight.  Chest x ray
   showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation.
   - try pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - continue antibiotics with azithromycin/ceftriaxone D #[**5-20**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned.
   - monitor BP,
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - listen for bowel sounds and when present initiate PO
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's
   - a line removed today after split caused bleeding
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin gtt
   -Pain management with fentanyl
   -ppi with famotidine
   -Bowel regimen with docusate, senna when taking PO

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest, requiring defibrillation twice, and presenting with ST elevations on EKG. He was initiated on a cooling protocol and has since been rewarmed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 37.7°C, HR 74 bpm, BP 94/49 mmHg, RR 18 inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%
* Neurological examination: The patient has a poor neurological exam, with sluggish corneal reflex on the left, absent on the right, and bilateral normal biceps reflexes. He has increased tone in his legs with absent patella and plantar reflexes. He is able to move all four extremities, but the purposefulness of the movement is unclear.
* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving pressure support ventilation. His chest x-ray shows right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has hypertension, which has been treated with nitroglycerin and dopamine, but has since been weaned. He has a history of cardiac arrest, and his EKG shows resolution of ST elevations.
* Renal function: The patient has low urine output, which has responded to initial boluses of fluid but has since decreased. His FENa and FEUrea are prerenal.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has a nasogastric tube in place and has been NPO while on paralytics. He has been started on famotidine IV for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
* Infections: The patient has a moderate bacteria count on his urine culture, but cultures have shown no growth.
* Medications: The patient is receiving a variety of medications, including aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, heparin, fentanyl, midazolam, and famotidine.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may require further interventions to improve his ventilation.
* Renal failure: The patient's low urine output and prerenal FENa and FEUrea suggest that he may be at risk for acute kidney injury.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's nasogastric tube and history of NPO status may increase his risk for gastrointestinal complications such as aspiration or bowel obstruction.
* Infection: The patient's moderate bacteria count on his urine culture and lack of growth on cultures suggest that he may be at risk for infection.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and hypertension may increase his risk for further cardiovascular complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing aspirin, clopidogrel, and atorvastatin for cardiac protection
* Stopping heparin gtt due to decreasing cardiac biomarkers
* Monitoring the patient's neurological status and providing sedation as needed
* Continuing pressure support ventilation and attempting spontaneous breathing trials
* Monitoring the patient's urine output and renal function
* Providing gastrointestinal support with famotidine and docusate
* Continuing antibiotics for urinary tract infection
* Monitoring the patient's blood pressure and adjusting medications as needed
* Providing pain management with fentanyl
* Continuing prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now approx 64 hrs post arrest.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trendind down
   - am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   Mental Status
   - Per cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr completed
 f/u with neuro
      * cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs
 has now been rewarmed (paralytics off
   since 5 am)
      *sedation also weaned
 neuro exam still showing defecits
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Appeciate Neurology input; will reach 72 hrs post arrest today for
   prognostication
   - Stop medazolam/fentanyl for neuro assessment today
   - continue propofol as needed for sedation, plan to turn off by 1:30 pm
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   yesterday, but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with
   respiratory compensation.  Was rested on AC overnight.  Chest x ray
   showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation.
   - try pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - continue antibiotics with azithromycin/ceftriaxone D #[**5-20**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned.
   - stop lopressor IV while starting propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down.  Fena/FeUrea was prerenal, however
   clearly also obstructed and possible UTI.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel
   sounds.
   - guiuac stools
   - check pm Hct
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics, but these
   stopped yesterday and bowel sounds present on exam.
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - start tube feeds
   - nutrition consult
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's
   - left groin double lumen central line
   - a line removed today after split caused bleeding
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin sub Q
   -Pain management with fentanyl / propofol
   -ppi with famotidine
   -Bowel regimen with docusate, senna when taking PO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2156-5-31**]
   - Paralytics turned off at about 4 or 5 a.m.
   - decreased sedation and warmed
   - Dopamine weaned off
   - Was acidotic on blood gas after warming. Appeared non-gap metabolic
   acidosis with imperfect respiratory compensation. Was some increase in
   pCO2 to 46 and acidotic, so figure that CO2 production increased with
   warming, so allowed patient to autoregulate on pressure support. ABG
   improved then switched to AC to rest again overnight with better ABGs.
   - Neuro exam after lightening of sedation, holding paralytics for 12
   hours and re-warming revealed sluggish corneal on left, absent on
   right, bilateral normal biceps reflexes, increased tone in legs with
   absent patella and plantar reflexes.  Later in evening was able to move
   all 4 extremities, but unclear if entirely purposeful.
   - Added beta-blocker 5 mg Lopressor IV q 6 h, but held early am doses
   due to hypotension
   - Was bolused 500 cc x 2 for low urine output (BP fine). Responded to
   first bolus but not so much for the second. Stop boluses as 7L+ LOS.
   FENa 0.4; FEUrea 26.5
   - Urine output fell off in afternoon then again in a.m. - bladder scan
   showed 900 cc - called Urology and tried their suggestions to no avail
   - they came and replaced with good urine output of about 1 liter
   - Patient sat up this a.m. and A-line split - quite some bleeding -
   A-line removed.

      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Appeciate Neurology input; will reach 72 hrs post arrest today for
   prognostication
   - Stop medazolam/fentanyl for neuro assessment today
   - continue propofol as needed for sedation, plan to turn off by 1:30 pm
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   yesterday, but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with
   respiratory compensation.  Was rested on AC overnight.  Chest x ray
   showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation.
   - try pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - continue antibiotics with azithromycin/ceftriaxone D #[**5-20**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned.
   - stop lopressor IV while starting propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down.  Fena/FeUrea was prerenal, however
   clearly also obstructed and possible UTI.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel
   sounds.
   - guiuac stools
   - check pm Hct
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics, but these
   stopped yesterday and bowel sounds present on exam.
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - start tube feeds

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, requiring defibrillation twice. He has a poor neurological exam, with sluggish corneal reflex on the left and absent on the right, bilateral normal biceps reflexes, increased tone in the legs with absent patella and plantar reflexes. He was cooled to 33.5°C for 24 hours and then rewarmed. He has been intubated and ventilated, and has been on pressure support, but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including aspirin, Plavix, atorvastatin, heparin, fentanyl, and midazolam. He has also been receiving antibiotics, including azithromycin and ceftriaxone.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.7°C
* Heart rate: 74 bpm
* Blood pressure: 94/49 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 6.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 133 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.38 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L

Potential medical complications:

* Cardiac complications:
	+ Myocardial infarction (STEMI/NSTEMI)
	+ Cardiac arrest
	+ Hypertension
* Respiratory complications:
	+ Respiratory failure
	+ Non-gap acidosis
	+ Pneumonia
* Neurological complications:
	+ Severe neurological deficit
	+ Brain edema
	+ Seizures
* Renal complications:
	+ Acute kidney injury (ARF)
	+ Urinary tract infection (UTI)
	+ Obstruction
* Gastrointestinal complications:
	+ Bowel obstruction
	+ Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Infectious complications:
	+ Sepsis
	+ UTI
	+ Pneumonia

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is at high risk for cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, and hypertension. He is also at risk for respiratory complications, including respiratory failure and non-gap acidosis. His neurological exam is poor, and he is at risk for further neurological deterioration. He is also at risk for renal complications, including acute kidney injury and urinary tract infection.

The plan is to continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results, and to adjust his treatment plan accordingly. He will continue to receive antibiotics, including azithromycin and ceftriaxone, and will be monitored for signs of sepsis. He will also be monitored for signs of respiratory failure and will be given oxygen therapy as needed. His neurological exam will be closely monitored, and he will be given medications to manage his symptoms and prevent further deterioration."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2156-5-31**]
   - Paralytics turned off at about 4 or 5 a.m.
   - decreased sedation and warmed
   - Dopamine weaned off
   - Was acidotic on blood gas after warming. Appeared non-gap metabolic
   acidosis with imperfect respiratory compensation. Was some increase in
   pCO2 to 46 and acidotic, so figure that CO2 production increased with
   warming, so allowed patient to autoregulate on pressure support. ABG
   improved then switched to AC to rest again overnight with better ABGs.
   - Neuro exam after lightening of sedation, holding paralytics for 12
   hours and re-warming revealed sluggish corneal on left, absent on
   right, bilateral normal biceps reflexes, increased tone in legs with
   absent patella and plantar reflexes.  Later in evening was able to move
   all 4 extremities, but unclear if entirely purposeful.
   - Added beta-blocker 5 mg Lopressor IV q 6 h, but held early am doses
   due to hypotension
   - Was bolused 500 cc x 2 for low urine output (BP fine). Responded to
   first bolus but not so much for the second. Stop boluses as 7L+ LOS.
   FENa 0.4; FEUrea 26.5
   - Urine output fell off in afternoon then again in a.m. - bladder scan
   showed 900 cc - called Urology and tried their suggestions to no avail
   - they came and replaced with good urine output of about 1 liter
   - Patient sat up this a.m. and A-line split - quite some bleeding -
   A-line removed.

   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now approx 64 hrs post arrest.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trendind down
   - am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   Mental Status
   - Per cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr completed
 f/u with neuro
      * cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs
 has now been rewarmed (paralytics off
   since 5 am)
      *sedation also weaned
 neuro exam still showing defecits
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Appeciate Neurology input; will reach 72 hrs post arrest today for
   prognostication
   - Stop medazolam/fentanyl for neuro assessment today
   - continue propofol as needed for sedation, plan to turn off by 1:30 pm
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   yesterday, but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with
   respiratory compensation.  Was rested on AC overnight.  Chest x ray
   showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation.
   - try pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - continue antibiotics with azithromycin/ceftriaxone D #[**5-20**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned.
   - stop lopressor IV while starting propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down.  Fena/FeUrea was prerenal, however
   clearly also obstructed and possible UTI.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel

   - guiuac stools
   - check pm Hct
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics, but these

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now approx 64 hrs post arrest.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trendind down
   - am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   Mental Status
   - Per cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr completed
 f/u with neuro
      * cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs
 has now been rewarmed (paralytics off
   since 5 am)
      *sedation also weaned
 neuro exam still showing defecits
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Appeciate Neurology input; will reach 72 hrs post arrest today for
   prognostication
   - Stop medazolam/fentanyl for neuro assessment today
   - continue propofol as needed for sedation, plan to turn off by 1:30 pm
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   yesterday, but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with
   respiratory compensation.  Was rested on AC overnight.  Chest x ray
   showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation.
   - try pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - continue antibiotics with azithromycin/ceftriaxone D #[**5-20**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned.
   - stop lopressor IV while starting propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down.  Fena/FeUrea was prerenal, however
   clearly also obstructed and possible UTI.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel
   sounds.
   - guiuac stools
   - check pm Hct
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics, but these
   stopped yesterday and bowel sounds present on exam.
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - start tube feeds
   - nutrition consult
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's
   - left groin double lumen central line
   - a line removed today after split caused bleeding
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin sub Q
   -Pain management with fentanyl / propofol
   -ppi with famotidine
   -Bowel regimen with docusate, senna when taking PO

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, with non-gap acidosis and respiratory compensation. Further attempts to wean him off the ventilator may be challenging.
2. Neurological deficits: The patient's neurological exam has revealed sluggish corneal reflexes, absent patellar and plantar reflexes, and increased tone in the legs. These deficits may be indicative of a poor neurological outcome.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, which may be contributing to cerebral ischemia or infarction. Close monitoring and management of hypertension are essential.
4. UTI: The patient's urine cultures have shown no growth, but moderate bacteria have been seen on urine analysis. Repeated urine cultures and antibiotic treatment may be necessary to manage this potential infection.
5. Low urine output/obstruction: The patient's urine output has been low, and a bladder scan has revealed a significant amount of urine in the bladder. Urology consultation has been sought, and a Foley catheter has been replaced. Further management of this issue is necessary.
6. Anemia: The patient's Hct is low, and he has experienced bleeding from a ruptured arterial line. Close monitoring of his hematocrit and potential blood transfusions may be necessary.
7. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient has an OG tube in place and has been NPO while on paralytics. Bowel sounds are present on exam, but guaiac stools and PM Hct should be checked to monitor for potential gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Wound infection: The patient has a ruptured arterial line, which may increase his risk of wound infection. Close monitoring of the wound and potential antibiotic treatment may be necessary.
9. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has had a cardiac arrest, and his cardiac biomarkers have trended down. Close monitoring of his cardiac status and potential arrhythmias is necessary.
10. Pain management: The patient is receiving fentanyl and propofol for pain management, but his pain response is questionable. Close monitoring of his pain and potential adjustments to his pain regimen may be necessary.

In summary, the patient's progress note highlights several potential medical complications that require close monitoring and management."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2156-5-31**]
   - Paralytics off at about 4 or 5 a.m.
   - Dopamine weaned off
   - Warming completed slightly early - patient's thermogenesis took off
   at about 36 degrees.
   - Started to decrease sedation while warming
   - Added beta-blocker 5 mg Lopressor IV (still ileus s/p paralytics) and
   decided to start q6h for now. Increase or start oral depending on
   subsequent events.
   - Was acidotic on blood gas after warming. Appeared non-gap metabolic
   acidosis with imperfect respiratory compensation. Was some increase in
   pCO2 to 46 and acidotic, so figure that CO2 production increased with
   warming, so allowed patient to autoregulate on pressure support. ABG
   improved then switched to AC to rest again overnight with better ABGs.
   - Neuro exam after lightening of sedation, holding paralytics for 12
   hours and re-warming revealed sluggish corneal on left, absent on
   right, bilateral normal biceps reflexes, increased tone in legs with
   absent patella and plantar reflexes.  Later in evening was able to move
   all 4 extremities, but unclear if entirely purposeful.
   - Repeat ABG on PSV
   - Neurology have not left a note, unclear if formally following - will
   be able to prognosticate better tomorrow, so will call them early in
   the a.m.
   - Was bolused 500 cc x 2 for low urine output (BP fine). Responded to
   first bolus but not so much for the second. Stop boluses as 7L+ LOS.
   FENa 0.4; FEUrea 26.5
   - Urine output fell off in afternoon then again in a.m. - bladder scan
   showed 900 cc - called Urology and tried their suggestions to no avail
   - they came and replaced with good urine output of about 1 liter
   - Patient sat up this a.m. and A-line split - quite some bleeding -
   A-line removed.

   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now approx 64 hrs post arrest.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - heparin gtt until can go to catheterization, pending neuro recovery
   - am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   - follow cardiac biomarkers (CKMB peaked, troponin trending down
   overall)
   - Per cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr complete
      * cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs
 has now been rewarmed (paralytics off
   since 5 am)
      *sedation also weaned
 neuro exam still showing defecits
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   Mental Status
   Paralytics and sedation weaned.  Exam shows
   - Appeciate Neurology input; will reach 72 hrs post arrest today for
   prognostication
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   yesterday, but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with
   respiratory compensation.  Was rested on AC overnight.  Chest x ray
   showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation.
   - try pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - continue antibiotics with azithromycin/ceftriaxone D #[**5-20**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was weaned.
   - 5 mg IV lopressor Q 6 Hr while NPO
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2156-5-31**]
   - Paralytics off at about 4 or 5 a.m.
   - Dopamine weaned off
   - Warming completed slightly early - patient's thermogenesis took off
   at about 36 degrees.
   - Started to decrease sedation while warming
   - Added beta-blocker 5 mg Lopressor IV (still ileus s/p paralytics) and
   decided to start q6h for now. Increase or start oral depending on
   subsequent events.
   - Was acidotic on blood gas after warming. Appeared non-gap metabolic
   acidosis with imperfect respiratory compensation. Was some increase in
   pCO2 to 46 and acidotic, so figure that CO2 production increased with
   warming, so allowed patient to autoregulate on pressure support. ABG
   improved then switched to AC to rest again overnight with better ABGs.
   - Neuro exam after lightening of sedation, holding paralytics for 12
   hours and re-warming revealed sluggish corneal on left, absent on
   right, bilateral normal biceps reflexes, increased tone in legs with
   absent patella and plantar reflexes.  Later in evening was able to move
   all 4 extremities, but unclear if entirely purposeful.
   - Repeat ABG on PSV
   - Neurology have not left a note, unclear if formally following - will
   be able to prognosticate better tomorrow, so will call them early in
   the a.m.
   - Was bolused 500 cc x 2 for low urine output (BP fine). Responded to
   first bolus but not so much for the second. Stop boluses as 7L+ LOS.
   FENa 0.4; FEUrea 26.5
   - Urine output fell off in afternoon then again in a.m. - bladder scan
   showed 900 cc - called Urology and tried their suggestions to no avail
   - they came and replaced with good urine output of about 1 liter
   - Patient sat up this a.m. and A-line split - quite some bleeding -
   A-line removed.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after cardiac arrest, requiring defibrillation twice, and subsequent ST elevations on EKG. The patient has a poor neurological exam and is currently intubated and ventilated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, and blood pressure of 94/49 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support includes pressure support ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute.

The patient's neurological exam reveals sluggish corneal reflexes on the left and absent reflexes on the right, increased tone in the legs, and absent patella and plantar reflexes. The patient's EEG shows theta and superimposed beta waves, indicating a coma.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac biomarkers, including CKMB and troponin-T, indicating myocardial infarction. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the patient is receiving antibiotics for possible sepsis.

The patient's medical conditions include cardiac arrest, hypertension, and possible acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The patient's medications include aspirin, plavix, and atorvastatin for cardiac management, and fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation management.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and possible AMI may lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac tamponade.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's poor neurological exam and coma may lead to further neurological deterioration, such as brain edema, herniation, or increased intracranial pressure.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure and intubation may lead to further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, or hypoxemia.
4. Infectious complications: The patient's antibiotics and possible sepsis may lead to further infectious complications, such as bacteremia, septic shock, or multi-organ failure.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hypertension and possible AMI may lead to further hemodynamic instability, such as hypotension, shock, or cardiac failure.

Based on the patient's condition, further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now approx 64 hrs post arrest.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trendind down
   - am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   Mental Status
   - Per cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr completed
 f/u with neuro
      * cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs
 has now been rewarmed (paralytics off
   since 5 am)
      *sedation also weaned
 neuro exam still showing defecits
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Appeciate Neurology input; will reach 72 hrs post arrest today for
   prognostication
   - Stop medazolam/fentanyl for neuro assessment today
   - continue propofol as needed for sedation, plan to turn off by 1:30 pm
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   yesterday, but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with
   respiratory compensation.  Was rested on AC overnight.  Chest x ray
   showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation.
   - try pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - continue antibiotics with azithromycin/ceftriaxone D #[**5-20**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned.
   - stop lopressor IV while starting propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - listen for bowel sounds and when present initiate PO
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's
   - a line removed today after split caused bleeding
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin gtt
   -Pain management with fentanyl
   -ppi with famotidine
   -Bowel regimen with docusate, senna when taking PO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2156-5-31**]
   - Paralytics turned off at about 4 or 5 a.m.
   - decreased sedation and warmed
   - Dopamine weaned off
   - Was acidotic on blood gas after warming. Appeared non-gap metabolic
   acidosis with imperfect respiratory compensation. Was some increase in
   pCO2 to 46 and acidotic, so figure that CO2 production increased with
   warming, so allowed patient to autoregulate on pressure support. ABG
   improved then switched to AC to rest again overnight with better ABGs.
   - Neuro exam after lightening of sedation, holding paralytics for 12
   hours and re-warming revealed sluggish corneal on left, absent on
   right, bilateral normal biceps reflexes, increased tone in legs with
   absent patella and plantar reflexes.  Later in evening was able to move
   all 4 extremities, but unclear if entirely purposeful.
   - Added beta-blocker 5 mg Lopressor IV q 6 h, but held early am doses
   due to hypotension
   - Was bolused 500 cc x 2 for low urine output (BP fine). Responded to
   first bolus but not so much for the second. Stop boluses as 7L+ LOS.
   FENa 0.4; FEUrea 26.5
   - Urine output fell off in afternoon then again in a.m. - bladder scan
   showed 900 cc - called Urology and tried their suggestions to no avail
   - they came and replaced with good urine output of about 1 liter
   - Patient sat up this a.m. and A-line split - quite some bleeding -
   A-line removed.

   - monitor with  ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - continue antibiotics with azithromycin/ceftriaxone D #[**5-20**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned.
   - stop lopressor IV while starting propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with no past medical history or recent medical care who presented after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation twice, with ST elevations on EKG by EMS and OSH. He was transferred for further management and found to have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam. The patient was initiated on a cooling protocol and is now approximately 64 hours post-arrest.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 37.7°C, Heart rate 74 bpm, Blood pressure 94/49 mmHg, Respiratory rate 18 inspirations per minute, Oxygen saturation 100%.
* Neurological exam: Sluggish corneal reflex on the left, absent on the right, bilateral normal biceps reflexes, increased tone in legs with absent patella and plantar reflexes. Later in the evening, the patient was able to move all four extremities, but it is unclear if the movement was entirely purposeful.
* Cardiovascular system: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, and his EKG shows resolution of ST elevations. He is being treated with aspirin, Plavix, and high-dose atorvastatin.
* Respiratory system: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming and respiratory compensation, but his ABG improved after being rested on AC overnight.
* Gastrointestinal system: The patient has an OG tube in place and has been NPO while on paralytics. He is being treated with famotidine IV Q 12.
* Renal system: The patient has low urine output and obstruction, with a FENa of 0.4 and FEUrea of 26.5. He was bolused twice for low urine output, but the response was temporary. A bladder scan showed almost a liter of urine in the bladder.
* Infectious disease: The patient has a moderate bacteria seen on UA from 5-29 and 5-30, but cultures show no growth. He is being treated with antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
* Respiratory complications: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or respiratory failure.
* Neurological complications: The patient has a poor neurological exam and is at risk for further neurological deterioration, such as stroke or seizures.
* Renal complications: The patient has low urine output and obstruction, which can lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
* Infectious complications: The patient has a moderate bacteria seen on UA, which can lead to sepsis or other infectious complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the plan is to continue aspirin, Plavix, and high-dose atorvastatin for cardiac management. The patient will be continued on pressure support and attempted SBT for possible extubation. The patient will also be monitored for respiratory failure, and antibiotics will be continued for UTI. The patient's low urine output and obstruction will be managed with further evaluation and treatment as needed."

   Assessment
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now approx 64 hrs post arrest.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trendind down
   - am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   Mental Status
   - Per cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr completed
 f/u with neuro
      * cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs
 has now been rewarmed (paralytics off
   since 5 am)
      *sedation also weaned
 neuro exam still showing defecits
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Appeciate Neurology input; will reach 72 hrs post arrest today for
   prognostication
   - Stop medazolam/fentanyl for neuro assessment today
   - continue propofol as needed for sedation, plan to turn off by 1:30 pm
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   yesterday, but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with
   respiratory compensation.  Was rested on AC overnight.  Chest x ray
   showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation.
   - try pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - continue antibiotics with azithromycin/ceftriaxone D #[**5-20**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned.
   - stop lopressor IV while starting propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down.  Fena/FeUrea was prerenal, however
   clearly also obstructed and possible UTI.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel
   sounds.
   - guiuac stools
   - check pm Hct
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics, but these
   stopped yesterday and bowel sounds present on exam.
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - start tube feeds
   - nutrition consult
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's
   - left groin double lumen central line
   - a line removed today after split caused bleeding
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin sub Q

   -ppi with famotidine
   -Bowel regimen with docusate, senna when taking PO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ECG: .
   Assessment
   66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now approx 64 hrs post arrest.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trendind down
   - am EKG and monitor on telemetry
   Mental Status
   - Per cooling protocol;
      *continuous EEG x 48 hr completed
 f/u with neuro
      * cool to 33.5 x 24 hrs
 has now been rewarmed (paralytics off
   since 5 am)
      *sedation also weaned
 neuro exam still showing defecits
      *HOB elevated > 30 degrees
   - Appeciate Neurology input; will reach 72 hrs post arrest today for
   prognostication
   - Stop medazolam/fentanyl for neuro assessment today
   - continue propofol as needed for sedation, plan to turn off by 1:30 pm
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   yesterday, but developed non-gap acidosis with rewarming with
   respiratory compensation.  Was rested on AC overnight.  Chest x ray
   showed right perihilar haze that could be edema or consolidation.
   - try pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG  (goal CO2 < 40)
   - continue antibiotics with azithromycin/ceftriaxone D #[**5-20**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned.
   - stop lopressor IV while starting propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down.  Fena/FeUrea was prerenal, however
   clearly also obstructed and possible UTI.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel
   sounds.
   - guiuac stools
   - check pm Hct
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics, but these
   stopped yesterday and bowel sounds present on exam.
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - start tube feeds
   - nutrition consult
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's
   - left groin double lumen central line
   - a line removed today after split caused bleeding
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin sub Q
   -Pain management with fentanyl / propofol
   -ppi with famotidine
   -Bowel regimen with docusate, senna when taking PO

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Aspiration pneumonia due to thick secretions and decreased sat levels.
	* Non-gap acidosis with respiratory compensation, which may lead to respiratory failure.
	* Potential for respiratory failure due to continued need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Hypertension, which may lead to cerebral ischemia or infarction, and require continued monitoring and management.
	* Potential for cardiac arrhythmias due to ongoing sedation and anesthesia.
3. Neurological Complications:
	* Encephalopathy, which may worsen or lead to further neurological deficits.
	* Potential for seizures or status epilepticus due to ongoing sedation and anesthesia.
4. Infectious Complications:
	* UTI, which may lead to sepsis or bacteremia, and require continued antibiotic management.
	* Potential for pneumonia or other secondary infections due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Feeding tube placement and management, which may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as constipation or diarrhea.
	* Potential for malnutrition or dehydration due to prolonged fasting and inadequate nutrition.
6. Hematological Complications:
	* Anemia, which may worsen or require further management.
	* Potential for bleeding complications due to ongoing anticoagulation therapy.
7. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury, which may worsen or require further management.
	* Potential for chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease due to ongoing kidney injury.

Overall, the patient is at risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or mitigate these complications."

   likely VF arrest.
   24 Hour Events:
   - sedation weaned and evaluated by neuro who were encouraged by
   spontaneous movements, downgoing babinsky, followed simple command of
   raising leg, eeg showed alpha waves
   - sats dropped so got CXR which shows worsening opacities on right, but
   sats improved when better sedated (thought to be from struggling
   against machine)
   -neuro recommended head CT and take it day by day with neuro exams
   - restarted on propofol after neuro evaluation for sedation and
   hypertension
   - Head CT preliminarily showed no acute infarction
   - started on tube feeds
   - pm crit stable
   - 4 am, decreasing sats to high 80s, thick secretions, temp 100 po,
   worsening CXR earlier so --> started on vanc/zosyn for aspiration
   - was found to be autopeeping, which resolved with CPAP and increased
   propofol to 60 mg(also abg O2 better than pleth sats)
   - this am had RSBI despite sedation and was 40 on pressure support

   on cooling protocol.
     Further history from family suggests that CPR not done at scene and
   time from discovery (was moaning) until EMS and AED, restoration of
   cardiorespiratory activity about 10 minutes.
     Some improvement in exam since yesterday a.m., but Neurology note
   some features worse. Indeterminate prognosis. Will perform head MRI
   today, as suggested by Neurology.

   protocol and is now more than 72 hrs post arrest. CK-MB peaked on [**5-30**],
   but TT trending down from admission. Appears likely that ACS occurred
   some time prior to arrival in [**Hospital1 5**], given that TT had peaked.
   Therefore patient may have had some protracted myocardial ischemia
   followed by arrhythmia and collapse.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trending down
   - monitor on telemetry
   - maintain electrolytes: K > 4, Mg > 2
   Mental Status
   Given restoration of brainstem reflexes prior to 72 hours, prognosis is
   indeterminate, rather than poor. Patient
s neurologic status continues
   to evolve. CT with edema or clear near infarction. EEG revealed
   restoration of forebrain activity without seizure and was thus
   discontinued. Sedation still a factor in neurologic evaluation
 at 50
   now.
   - Appeciate Neurology input
 they would like head MRI (likely with
   DWI)
 their impression was some worsening today
   - Stop propofol for rounds today
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care, infiltrate
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   this a.m. with essentially normal gas. Concern for aspiration and PNA,
   therefore on vancomycin and Zosyn.
   - Extra dose of vancomycin this a.m. to
load
   - Continue pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG early this afternoon
   - Stop ceftriaxone, but continue azithromycin would have been/is D #[**6-19**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   - Given good gas on PSV and likely lying down (due to fem line) cause
   of PSV 5/10 needed, could likely extubate, but will need to perform
   sedated MRI first, then get PICC, pull femoral line
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned. Pressure ideally
   should be in 150s or so post-cardiac arrest, but the benefit of this is
   likely no longer present
 will therefore aim for normal range.
   - stop lopressor IV while giving propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal normotension, systolics 100-140, with MAP > 65
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down. Like obstructive nephropathy along
   with ATN. Fena/FeUrea was pre-renal.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   - Spin urine to look for cast and red cells
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint: Cardiorespiratory arrest at home - cardiac etiology,
   likely VF arrest.
   24 Hour Events:
   - sedation weaned and evaluated by neuro who were encouraged by
   spontaneous movements, downgoing babinsky, followed simple command of
   raising leg, eeg showed alpha waves
   - sats dropped so got CXR which shows worsening opacities on right, but
   sats improved when better sedated (thought to be from struggling
   against machine)
   -neuro recommended head CT and take it day by day with neuro exams
   - restarted on propofol after neuro evaluation for sedation and
   hypertension
   - Head CT preliminarily showed no acute infarction
   - started on tube feeds
   - pm crit stable
   - 4 am, decreasing sats to high 80s, thick secretions, temp 100 po,
   worsening CXR earlier so --> started on vanc/zosyn for aspiration
   - was found to be autopeeping, which resolved with CPAP and increased
   propofol to 60 mg(also abg O2 better than pleth sats)
   - this am had RSBI despite sedation and was 40 on pressure support

   Assessment
     66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
     Further history from family suggests that CPR not done at scene and
   time from discovery (was moaning) until EMS and AED, restoration of
   cardiorespiratory activity about 10 minutes.
     Some improvement in exam since yesterday a.m., but Neurology note
   some features worse. Indeterminate prognosis. Will perform head MRI
   today, as suggested by Neurology.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now more than 72 hrs post arrest. CK-MB peaked on [**5-30**],
   but TT trending down from admission. Appears likely that ACS occurred
   some time prior to arrival in [**Hospital1 5**], given that TT had peaked.
   Therefore patient may have had some protracted myocardial ischemia
   followed by arrhythmia and collapse.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trending down
   - monitor on telemetry
   - maintain electrolytes: K > 4, Mg > 2

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 66-year-old male who presented with cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. He has been in the ICU for several days and has been receiving various treatments, including sedation, ventilation, and antibiotics.

The patient's neurological status is indeterminate, and he is still in a coma. His brainstem reflexes have been restored, but he has not shown any significant improvement in his neurological function. He has been receiving propofol for sedation and has been weaned off of it.

The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. He has been on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has shown good gas exchange. His respiratory support plan includes continuing PSV, attempting spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), and monitoring with arterial blood gases (ABG) early in the afternoon.

The patient has hypertension, which has been managed with nitroglycerin and dopamine. His blood pressure is currently being monitored and managed to maintain a normal range.

The patient has a Foley catheter in place and has been experiencing low urine output. He has been receiving IV fluids and has had a bladder scan, which showed almost a liter of urine in the bladder. His creatinine levels are stable and trending down.

The patient has anemia, which is likely due to bleeding from a ruptured arterial line. He has been receiving IV fluids and has had a guaiac stool test, which was negative.

The patient has a nasogastric (NG) tube in place and has been receiving tube feeds. He has been NPO while on paralytics, but these have been stopped, and he has been having bowel sounds on exam.

The patient has a central line in place and has been receiving prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin subcutaneously.

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still critical, and he may require continued mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been receiving antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia, and he may be at risk for developing sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently being monitored and managed, but he may be at risk for developing hypotension.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable and trending down, but he may be at risk for developing acute kidney injury (AKI) if his blood pressure becomes unstable.
5. Bleeding: The patient has been bleeding from a ruptured arterial line, and he may be at risk for further bleeding complications.
6. Infection: The patient has been experiencing low urine output and has a Foley catheter in place, which may increase his risk for developing a urinary tract infection (UTI).
7. Malnutrition: The patient has been receiving tube feeds, but he may be at risk for malnutrition if his nutrition is not adequately managed.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and he requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Fluid analysis / Other labs: None.
   Imaging:
   Head CT without gross edema, some periventricular white matter disease
   and cerebral atrophy, but no clear acute infarction. No bleed.
   CXR Some edema and concern for retrocardiac opacity, but no other lobar
   consolidation.
   Microbiology: Sputum: 4+ GPC in pairs and clusters.
   Blood and urine: Pending. No growth so far from [**5-29**] onward.
   ECG: No new this a.m. Q-waves in inferior distribution that correlate
   with echo. ST segment changes, peri-arrest have resolved.
   Assessment
     66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
     Further history from family suggests that CPR not done at scene and
   time from discovery (was moaning) until EMS and AED, restoration of
   cardiorespiratory activity about 10 minutes.
     Some improvement in exam since yesterday a.m., but Neurology note
   some features worse. Indeterminate prognosis. Will perform head MRI
   today, as suggested by Neurology.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now more than 72 hrs post arrest. CK-MB peaked on [**5-30**],
   but TT trending down from admission. Appears likely that ACS occurred
   some time prior to arrival in [**Hospital1 5**], given that TT had peaked.
   Therefore patient may have had some protracted myocardial ischemia
   followed by arrhythmia and collapse.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trending down
   - monitor on telemetry
   - maintain electrolytes: K > 4, Mg > 2
   Mental Status
   Given restoration of brainstem reflexes prior to 72 hours, prognosis is
   indeterminate, rather than poor. Patient
s neurologic status continues
   to evolve. CT with edema or clear near infarction. EEG revealed
   restoration of forebrain activity without seizure and was thus
   discontinued. Sedation still a factor in neurologic evaluation
 at 50
   now.
   - Appeciate Neurology input
 they would like head MRI (likely with
   DWI)
 their impression was some worsening today
   - Stop propofol for rounds today
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care, infiltrate
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   this a.m. with essentially normal gas. Concern for aspiration and PNA,
   therefore on vancomycin and Zosyn.
   - Extra dose of vancomycin this a.m. to
load
   - Continue pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG early this afternoon
   - Stop ceftriaxone, but continue azithromycin would have been/is D #[**6-19**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   - Given good gas on PSV and likely lying down (due to fem line) cause
   of PSV 5/10 needed, could likely extubate, but will need to perform
   sedated MRI first, then get PICC, pull femoral line
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned. Pressure ideally
   should be in 150s or so post-cardiac arrest, but the benefit of this is
   likely no longer present
 will therefore aim for normal range.
   - stop lopressor IV while giving propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal normotension, systolics 100-140, with MAP > 65
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down. Like obstructive nephropathy along
   with ATN. Fena/FeUrea was pre-renal.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   - Spin urine to look for cast and red cells
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel
   sounds. Should be reversible
   - guiuac stools
   - check pm Hct
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics, but these
   stopped yesterday and bowel sounds present on exam.
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - start tube feeds
   - nutrition consult
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's
   - left groin double lumen central line
   - a line removed today after split caused bleeding
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin sub Q
   -Pain management with fentanyl / propofol
   -ppi with famotidine
   -Bowel regimen with docusate, senna when taking PO

   consolidation.
   Microbiology: Sputum: 4+ GPC in pairs and clusters.
   Blood and urine: Pending. No growth so far from [**5-29**] onward.
   ECG: No new this a.m. Q-waves in inferior distribution that correlate
   with echo. ST segment changes, peri-arrest have resolved.
   Assessment
     66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
     Further history from family suggests that CPR not done at scene and
   time from discovery (was moaning) until EMS and AED, restoration of
   cardiorespiratory activity about 10 minutes.
     Some improvement in exam since yesterday a.m., but Neurology note
   some features worse. Indeterminate prognosis. Will perform head MRI
   today, as suggested by Neurology.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now more than 72 hrs post arrest. CK-MB peaked on [**5-30**],
   but TT trending down from admission. Appears likely that ACS occurred
   some time prior to arrival in [**Hospital1 5**], given that TT had peaked.
   Therefore patient may have had some protracted myocardial ischemia
   followed by arrhythmia and collapse.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trending down
   - monitor on telemetry
   - maintain electrolytes: K > 4, Mg > 2
   Mental Status
   Given restoration of brainstem reflexes prior to 72 hours, prognosis is
   indeterminate, rather than poor. Patient
s neurologic status continues
   to evolve. CT with edema or clear near infarction. EEG revealed
   restoration of forebrain activity without seizure and was thus
   discontinued. Sedation still a factor in neurologic evaluation
 at 50
   now.
   - Appeciate Neurology input
 they would like head MRI (likely with
   DWI)
 their impression was some worsening today
   - Stop propofol for rounds today
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care, infiltrate
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   this a.m. with essentially normal gas. Concern for aspiration and PNA,
   therefore on vancomycin and Zosyn.
   - Extra dose of vancomycin this a.m. to
load
   - Continue pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG early this afternoon
   - Stop ceftriaxone, but continue azithromycin would have been/is D #[**6-19**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   - Given good gas on PSV and likely lying down (due to fem line) cause
   of PSV 5/10 needed, could likely extubate, but will need to perform
   sedated MRI first, then get PICC, pull femoral line
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned. Pressure ideally
   should be in 150s or so post-cardiac arrest, but the benefit of this is
   likely no longer present
 will therefore aim for normal range.
   - stop lopressor IV while giving propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal normotension, systolics 100-140, with MAP > 65
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down. Like obstructive nephropathy along
   with ATN. Fena/FeUrea was pre-renal.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   - Spin urine to look for cast and red cells
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel
   sounds. Should be reversible
   - guiuac stools
   - check pm Hct
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics, but these
   stopped yesterday and bowel sounds present on exam.
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - start tube feeds
   - nutrition consult
   ACCESS

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male who was brought to the hospital after a cardiac arrest at home. He was found to have no past medical history or recent medical care. He was initiated on a cooling protocol and was found to have resolution of ST elevations on EKG. He has shown some improvement in his neurological exam since yesterday, but his neurology notes some features that are worse. He is currently intubated and on pressure support, and has been started on antibiotics for aspiration and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest may have caused irreversible brain damage, and he may have a poor prognosis.
2. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's EKG showed Q-waves in the inferior distribution, which may indicate a myocardial infarction.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration of food or liquids may have caused pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
4. Sepsis: The patient's antibiotic treatment for aspiration and pneumonia may have caused sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may require prolonged mechanical ventilation, which can increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia and other complications.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological exam shows some signs of worsening, which may indicate a poor prognosis.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may have caused cerebral ischemia or infarction, which can lead to permanent brain damage or death.
8. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient's urinary tract infection may have caused sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
9. Low Urine Output: The patient's low urine output may indicate a urinary tract obstruction, which can lead to kidney damage or failure.
10. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be caused by bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a number of serious medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent these complications and improve his outcome."

   24 Hour Events:
   - sedation weaned and evaluated by neuro who were encouraged by
   spontaneous movements, downgoing babinsky, followed simple command of
   raising leg, eeg showed alpha waves
   - sats dropped so got CXR which shows worsening opacities on right, but
   sats improved when better sedated (thought to be from struggling
   against machine)
   -neuro recommended head CT and take it day by day with neuro exams
   - restarted on propofol after neuro evaluation for sedation and
   hypertension
   - Head CT preliminarily showed no acute infarction
   - started on tube feeds
   - pm crit stable
   - 4 am, decreasing sats to high 80s, thick secretions, temp 100 po,
   worsening CXR earlier so --> started on vanc/zosyn for aspiration
   - was found to be autopeeping, which resolved with CPAP and increased
   propofol to 60 mg(also abg O2 better than pleth sats)
   - this am had RSBI despite sedation and was 40 on pressure support

   but TT trending down from admission. Appears likely that ACS occurred
   some time prior to arrival in [**Hospital1 5**], given that TT had peaked.
   Therefore patient may have had some protracted myocardial ischemia
   followed by arrhythmia and collapse.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trending down
   - monitor on telemetry
   - maintain electrolytes: K > 4, Mg > 2
   Mental Status
   Given restoration of brainstem reflexes prior to 72 hours, prognosis is
   indeterminate, rather than poor. Patient
s neurologic status continues
   to evolve. CT with edema or clear near infarction. EEG revealed
   restoration of forebrain activity without seizure and was thus
   discontinued. Sedation still a factor in neurologic evaluation
 at 50
   now.
   - Appeciate Neurology input
   - Stop propofol for rounds today
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care, infiltrate
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   this a.m. with essentially normal gas. Concern for aspiration and PNA,
   therefore on vancomycin and Zosyn.
   - Extra dose of vancomycin this a.m. to
load
   - Continue pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG early this afternoon
   - Stop azithromycin/ceftriaxone would have been D #[**6-19**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned.
   - stop lopressor IV while starting propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal MAP > 60
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down. Like obstructive nephropathy along
   with ATN. Fena/FeUrea was pre-renal.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel
   sounds.
   - guiuac stools
   - check pm Hct
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics, but these
   stopped yesterday and bowel sounds present on exam.
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - start tube feeds
   - nutrition consult
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment
     66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
     Further history from family suggests that CPR not done at scene and
   time from discovery (was moaning) until EMS and AED, restoration of
   cardiorespiratory activity about 10 minutes.

   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling

   but TT trending down from admission. Appears likely that ACS occurred
   some time prior to arrival in [**Hospital1 5**], given that TT had peaked.
   Therefore patient may have had some protracted myocardial ischemia
   followed by arrhythmia and collapse.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male who presented to the emergency department after cardiac arrest, requiring defibrillation twice, and was found to have ST elevations on the EKG. He was initiated on a cooling protocol and is now more than 72 hours post-arrest.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and on pressure support, with a recent episode of autopeeping, which resolved with CPAP and increased propofol. He has a RSBI of 41 and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 158.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has hypertension, which was managed with nitroglycerin and dopamine. He has a history of cardiac arrest and is likely to have had a myocardial infarction (MI) with ventricular fibrillation (VFib) and probable ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
* Neurological: The patient has a poor neurological exam, with spontaneous movements, downgoing Babinski reflex, and the ability to follow simple commands. His EEG showed alpha waves, and his head CT showed no acute infarction.
* Renal: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, which is trending down.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a Foley catheter in place, and his abdomen is soft with normal bowel sounds.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.6 g/dL.
* Infectious: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with moderate bacteria seen on urine analysis, but cultures show no growth.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on pressure support, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if his condition deteriorates.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is at risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, and cardiogenic shock.
* Neurological complications: The patient has a poor neurological exam, and there is a risk of neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, and brain death.
* Renal complications: The patient has AKI, and there is a risk of renal failure and need for dialysis.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a Foley catheter in place, and there is a risk of urinary tract infections and gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Hematological complications: The patient has anemia, and there is a risk of bleeding complications.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications and to improve the patient's overall outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Cardiorespiratory arrest at home - cardiac etiology.
   24 Hour Events:
   - sedation weaned and evaluated by neuro who were encouraged by
   spontaneous movements, downgoing babinsky, followed simple command of
   raising leg, eeg showed alpha waves
   - sats dropped so got CXR which shows worsening opacities on right, but
   sats improved when better sedated (thought to be from struggling
   against machine)
   -neuro recommended head CT and take it day by day with neuro exams
   - restarted on propofol after neuro evaluation for sedation and
   hypertension
   - Head CT preliminarily showed no acute infarction
   - started on tube feeds
   - pm crit stable
   - 4 am, decreasing sats to high 80s, thick secretions, temp 100 po,
   worsening CXR earlier so --> started on vanc/zosyn for aspiration
   - was found to be autopeeping, which resolved with CPAP and increased
   propofol to 60 mg(also abg O2 better than pleth sats)
   - this am had RSBI despite sedation and was 40 on pressure support

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a [**Name (NI) **] who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing cardiorespiratory arrest at home. The patient has a history of cardiac etiology and is currently on propofol sedation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100°F, pulse rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 111/60 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a respiratory rate of 15 inspirations per minute and an oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's neurological status is altered, with encephalopathy and a lack of responsiveness. The patient's neuro exam is limited due to sedation, but the patient does show some spontaneous movements and responds to simple commands.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and troponin levels, indicating potential cardiac and respiratory complications. The patient's blood and urine cultures are pending, but no growth has been detected so far.

The patient's imaging studies, including a head CT, show no acute infarction or bleeding, but do show some periventricular white matter disease and cerebral atrophy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and the patient is at risk for further respiratory decline.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac etiology and elevated troponin levels suggest potential cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and encephalopathy suggest potential neurological complications, such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count suggest potential infection, and the patient's blood and urine cultures are pending.
5. Aspiration: The patient's decreased oxygen saturation and thick secretions suggest potential aspiration, and the patient has been started on antibiotics for aspiration.

Based on this information, the patient's ICU care plan should include:

1. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation.
2. Cardiac monitoring to detect any potential cardiac complications.
3. Neurological monitoring to detect any potential neurological complications.
4. Infection control measures, including antibiotics and antifungals as necessary.
5. Aspiration precautions, including elevating the head of the bed and providing oral care.
6. Tube feeding and glycemic control to manage the patient's nutritional and metabolic needs."

   Spontaneous purposeless movement, in [**Location (un) 408**]-J collar, itubated on
   pressure support, tube feeds not running, urine dark with some sediment
   Patient looks stated age and overweight.
   Scleral edema present, no icterus, some spontaneous facial movement.
   Neck
 actually moving within collar, but cannot assess JVP, tone, LAD,
   etc.
   Thorax of normal appearance, symmetric expansion, clear anteriorly and
   laterally, no area of reduced breath sounds.
   Heart sounds dual, no S3/4, no M/R. Cardiac percussion reveals normal
   span with some dullness also over PMI.
   Abdomen benign
 soft, resonant, bowel sounds present (normal).
   Peripheral pulses (radial and dorsalis pedis) normal.
   Patient opened eyes and fixated on mine with sternal rub along with
   saying

   Tone normal in arms and legs. Spontaneous movement of CN III, IV, V,
   VI, VII, [**Doctor First Name **], all limbs. Gag present (and results in increased movement
   of neck, face, limbs) when suctioned. Sluggish blink to confrontation,
   sluggish and small corneals bilaterally, pupils reactive (4->2 mm),
   biceps and brachioradialis not elicitable today, but knees brisk and

   Our prelim read: Leucoaraiosis, most marked around ventricles, some
   atrophy with enlarged ventricles, stable from CT. Comparison to CT
   reveals no notable edema. No obvious hypoperfusion injury (water-shed)
   or anoxic injury.
   Microbiology: Sputum culture reveals typical commensurate growth. GPCs
   in clusters seen on gram stain.
   ECG: .
   Assessment
     66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
     Further history from family suggests that CPR not done at scene and
   time from discovery (was moaning) until EMS and AED, restoration of
   cardiorespiratory activity about 10 minutes.
     Some improvement in exam since yesterday a.m., but Neurology note
   some features worse. Indeterminate prognosis. Will perform head MRI
   today, as suggested by Neurology.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now more than 72 hrs post arrest. CK-MB peaked on [**5-30**],
   but TT trending down from admission. Appears likely that ACS occurred
   some time prior to arrival in [**Hospital1 5**], given that TT had peaked.
   Therefore patient may have had some protracted myocardial ischemia
   followed by arrhythmia and collapse.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trending down
   - monitor on telemetry
   - maintain electrolytes: K > 4, Mg > 2
   Mental Status
   Given restoration of brainstem reflexes prior to 72 hours, prognosis is
   indeterminate, rather than poor. Patient
s neurologic status continues
   to evolve. CT with edema or clear near infarction. EEG revealed
   restoration of forebrain activity without seizure and was thus
   discontinued. Sedation still a factor in neurologic evaluation
 at 50
   now.
   - Appeciate Neurology input
 they would like head MRI (likely with
   DWI)
 their impression was some worsening today
   - Stop propofol for rounds today
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care, infiltrate
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   this a.m. with essentially normal gas. Concern for aspiration and PNA,
   therefore on vancomycin and Zosyn.
   - Extra dose of vancomycin this a.m. to
load
   - Continue pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG early this afternoon
   - Stop ceftriaxone, but continue azithromycin would have been/is D #[**6-19**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   - Given good gas on PSV and likely lying down (due to fem line) cause
   of PSV 5/10 needed, could likely extubate, but will need to perform
   sedated MRI first, then get PICC, pull femoral line
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned. Pressure ideally
   should be in 150s or so post-cardiac arrest, but the benefit of this is
   likely no longer present
 will therefore aim for normal range.
   - stop lopressor IV while giving propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal normotension, systolics 100-140, with MAP > 65
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down. Like obstructive nephropathy along
   with ATN. Fena/FeUrea was pre-renal.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   - Spin urine to look for cast and red cells
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel
   sounds. Should be reversible
   - guiuac stools
   - check pm Hct
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics, but these
   stopped yesterday and bowel sounds present on exam.
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - start tube feeds
   - nutrition consult
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's
   - left groin double lumen central line
   - a line removed today after split caused bleeding
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin sub Q
   -Pain management with fentanyl / propofol
   -ppi with famotidine
   -Bowel regimen with docusate, senna when taking PO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment
     66 YOM with no past medical history or recent medical care presents
   after cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation times 2, ST elevations on
   EKG by EMS and OSH, transferred for further management and found to
   have resolution of ST elevations but poor neurological exam.  Initiated
   on cooling protocol.
     Further history from family suggests that CPR not done at scene and
   time from discovery (was moaning) until EMS and AED, restoration of
   cardiorespiratory activity about 10 minutes.
     Some improvement in exam since yesterday a.m., but Neurology note
   some features worse. Indeterminate prognosis. Will perform head MRI
   today, as suggested by Neurology.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   Likely from MI causing vfib probably STEMI, although elevations
   resolved by the time he reached [**Hospital1 5**].  Was initiated on cooling
   protocol and is now more than 72 hrs post arrest. CK-MB peaked on [**5-30**],
   but TT trending down from admission. Appears likely that ACS occurred
   some time prior to arrival in [**Hospital1 5**], given that TT had peaked.
   Therefore patient may have had some protracted myocardial ischemia
   followed by arrhythmia and collapse.
   - Continue aspirin, plavix, high dose atorvastatin
   - stop heparin gtt  given cardiac biomarkers trending down
   - monitor on telemetry
   - maintain electrolytes: K > 4, Mg > 2
   Mental Status
   Given restoration of brainstem reflexes prior to 72 hours, prognosis is
   indeterminate, rather than poor. Patient
s neurologic status continues
   to evolve. CT with edema or clear near infarction. EEG revealed
   restoration of forebrain activity without seizure and was thus
   discontinued. Sedation still a factor in neurologic evaluation
 at 50
   now.
   - Appeciate Neurology input
 they would like head MRI (likely with
   DWI)
 their impression was some worsening today
   - Stop propofol for rounds today
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care, infiltrate
   Initially intubated for airway protection. Did well on pressure support
   this a.m. with essentially normal gas. Concern for aspiration and PNA,
   therefore on vancomycin and Zosyn.
   - Extra dose of vancomycin this a.m. to
load
   - Continue pressure support again today and attempt SBT for possible
   extubation
   - monitor with  ABG early this afternoon
   - Stop ceftriaxone, but continue azithromycin would have been/is D #[**6-19**]
   - Q 6 mouth care while on ventilator
   - Given good gas on PSV and likely lying down (due to fem line) cause
   of PSV 5/10 needed, could likely extubate, but will need to perform
   sedated MRI first, then get PICC, pull femoral line
   Hypertension
   Pt came to the floor with blood pressures above 250. Has to be some
   concern for cerebral ischemia/infarction as a cause, also consistent
   with posturing. [**Month (only) 8**] also have been pharmacologic/catecholaminergic.
   Was started on nitro gtt, but this was weaned.  Pt actually required
   dopamine for a short time, but this was also weaned. Pressure ideally
   should be in 150s or so post-cardiac arrest, but the benefit of this is
   likely no longer present
 will therefore aim for normal range.
   - stop lopressor IV while giving propofol as above which will likely
   drop pressure
   - will give dopamine if needed for hypotension
   - will eventually convert to PO beta blocker and ACEI once under better
   control and taking Pos
   - goal normotension, systolics 100-140, with MAP > 65
   UTI
   Moderate bacteria seen on UA from [**5-29**] and [**5-30**] but cultures show no
   growth.  Foley manipulated again last night.
   - repeat urine culture until no bacteria
   - continue antibiotics for now (D #4)
   Low urine output/obstruction
   Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially responded, but then
   dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but bladder scan showed
   almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.  Urology replaced foley.
   ARF
   Creatinine stable and trending down. Like obstructive nephropathy along
   with ATN. Fena/FeUrea was pre-renal.
   - Continue to trend creatinine
   - PRN IV bolus for urine output (with properly working foley)
   - Spin urine to look for cast and red cells
   Anemia:
   Repeat Hct low.  Had bleeding from ruptured arterial line today.  No
   BMs and no evidence of melena.  Also received IVF yesterday for low UOP
   so may have some dilutional component.  Abdomen soft and + bowel
   sounds. Should be reversible
   - guiuac stools
   - check pm Hct
   FEN/GI
   Has OG tube in place. Has been NPO while on paralytics, but these
   stopped yesterday and bowel sounds present on exam.
   - famotidine IV Q 12
   - start tube feeds
   - nutrition consult
   ACCESS
   2 x 18 G PIV's
   - left groin double lumen central line
   - a line removed today after split caused bleeding
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin sub Q
   -Pain management with fentanyl / propofol
   -ppi with famotidine
   -Bowel regimen with docusate, senna when taking PO

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 66-year-old male who presented to the ICU after a cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation twice, with ST elevations on EKG by EMS and OSH. He was intubated and placed on a cooling protocol. His neurological exam is poor, with no spontaneous movement, no response to pain, and no spinal reflexes. He has been on propofol sedation, which has been weaned. His cardiac biomarkers have trended down, and he has been started on aspirin, Plavix, and high-dose atorvastatin.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Complications:**
	* Myocardial infarction (STEMI) with potential for reinfarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
	* Cardiac arrest with potential for recurrent arrest or prolonged QT syndrome.
2. **Neurological Complications:**
	* Brainstem infarct or injury with potential for worsening neurological status.
	* Seizures or status epilepticus due to sedation weaning or other factors.
3. **Respiratory Complications:**
	* Pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
	* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to lung injury.
4. **Renal Complications:**
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypoperfusion or other factors.
	* Obstructive nephropathy due to urinary tract obstruction.
5. **Infectious Complications:**
	* Urinary tract infection (UTI) due to indwelling catheter or other factors.
	* Sepsis or septic shock due to bacteremia or other infections.
6. **Hematological Complications:**
	* Anemia due to bleeding, hemolysis, or other factors.
	* Thrombocytopenia due to platelet consumption or other factors.
7. **Nutritional Complications:**
	* Malnutrition or refeeding syndrome due to prolonged fasting or inadequate nutrition.
8. **Other Complications:**
	* Hypertension or hypotension due to cardiac or other factors.
	* Fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances due to fluid administration or other factors.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as needed.
2. Perform a head MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to assess for brainstem infarct or injury.
3. Wean sedation and attempt spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) to assess for extubation readiness.
4. Monitor for signs of respiratory failure or ARDS and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
5. Continue to trend creatinine and adjust fluid administration and diuretic therapy as needed.
6. Monitor for signs of UTI and adjust antibiotic therapy as needed.
7. Monitor for signs of anemia and adjust transfusion therapy as needed.
8. Consult with nutrition and gastroenterology teams to optimize nutritional support and bowel management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a likely VF arrest, requiring ICU care. The patient has undergone various medical interventions, including antibiotic administration, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and placement of a peripheral intravenous catheter (PICC line).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, and blood pressure of 107/89 mmHg. Respiratory support is provided through a ventilator, with a respiratory rate of 22 inspirations per minute and an oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's neurological examination is incomplete, with concerns raised about possible brain stem infarct. The MRI head scan revealed leukoaraiosis, atrophy, and enlarged ventricles, but no notable edema, hypoperfusion, or anoxic injury.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.1-7.0 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.9-10.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 133-162 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9-1.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.67 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 4.0 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. The plan is to continue ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Neurological deterioration: The patient's incomplete neurological examination and concerns about possible brain stem infarct raise the risk of neurological deterioration.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure, which may be exacerbated by their cardiac arrest and potential hypoperfusion, can lead to further respiratory compromise.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac arrest and potential myocardial infarction increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
4. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory failure increase the risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's cardiac arrest and potential hypoperfusion can lead to hemodynamic instability, including hypotension or hypertension.
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and potential hypoperfusion increase the risk of renal dysfunction or failure.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Physical Examination
   Early this a.m.
   Physical examination notable for profound sedation (propofol is at 60
   and failed RSBI). No spinal reflexes whatever. No response to pain. No
   spontaneous movement. Slight exotropia. Corneal reflexes intact (both
   eyes blink now). Pupillary response to light (3 mm) present (to 2 mm)
   but not maintained.
   Later after sedation weaned
   Patient with purposeful behavior, verbally interactive
 able to answer
   simple questions. Right nystagmus on right lateral gaze. Able to move
   all limbs to command. Facial movement symmetric. No further cognitive
   testing
 will reevaluate this p.m.
   Examination from yesterday:
   Spontaneous purposeless movement, in [**Location (un) 408**]-J collar, itubated on
   pressure support, tube feeds not running, urine dark with some sediment
   Patient looks stated age and overweight.
   Scleral edema present, no icterus, some spontaneous facial movement.
   Neck
 actually moving within collar, but cannot assess JVP, tone, LAD,
   etc.
   Thorax of normal appearance, symmetric expansion, clear anteriorly and
   laterally, no area of reduced breath sounds.
   Heart sounds dual, no S3/4, no M/R. Cardiac percussion reveals normal
   span with some dullness also over PMI.
   Abdomen benign
 soft, resonant, bowel sounds present (normal).
   Peripheral pulses (radial and dorsalis pedis) normal.
   Patient opened eyes and fixated on mine with sternal rub along with
   saying
[**Known firstname **]
. Did not follow commands to lift arms or close hands.
   Tone normal in arms and legs. Spontaneous movement of CN III, IV, V,
   VI, VII, [**Doctor First Name **], all limbs. Gag present (and results in increased movement
   of neck, face, limbs) when suctioned. Sluggish blink to confrontation,
   sluggish and small corneals bilaterally, pupils reactive (4->2 mm),
   biceps and brachioradialis not elicitable today, but knees brisk and

   atrophy with enlarged ventricles, stable from CT. Comparison to CT
   reveals no notable edema. No obvious hypoperfusion injury (water-shed)
   or anoxic injury.
   Microbiology: Sputum culture reveals typical commensurate growth. GPCs
   in clusters seen on gram stain.
   Telemetry
 short runs of VT as above.
   Assessment
     This 66-year-old man with angina, perioral cyanosis on exertion,
   without past medical attention presents after collapsing at home. Given
   moaning and then likely VF on AED, and upon enzymes, EKG, it seems
   likely that he suffered an AMI/ACS which resulted in VT/VF and
   collapse. CPR was given at the scene, with some signs of neurologic
   injury at early presentation
 absent papillary reflexes and posturing.
   However, he has continued to reestablish function rapidly during the
   stay and his examination and progress today is particularly
   encouraging. Neurological signs noted yesterday were likely in part
   false localizing given sedation. He is now extubated. Now that his
   prognosis is looking good from a neurologic standpoint, it will be
   important to further work up in coronary artery disease.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   As above
 likely ACS with subsequent VF. Will need catheterization,
   A1c, lipids, likely statin, beta-blocker, +/- ACE. Will ensure that
   aspiration risk is low and mental status is good prior to cath to
   reduce chance of aspiration.
   - Continue present medication regimen.
   Mental Status
   Given rapid improvement in Neurologic exam, prognosis will now be good.
   Still possible damage to vulnerable structures, particularly
   hippocampus. MRI reveals leukoariaosis but no evident recent
   infarction.
   - Appreciate input from Neurology and continue to examine.
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care, infiltrate
   Very bad RSBI this a.m. [**3-16**] propofol that had been increased for MRI
   yesterday. Extubated during rounds this a.m.
   Hypertension
   Pressures to 170s mmHg not immediately concerning. Allow to
   autoregulate and then control gently.
   - Will start ACE, calcium channel blocker.
   Low urine output/obstruction/ARF
   Renal failure resolving. Was likely mild ATN with brief obstructive
   nephropathy. Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially
   responded, but then dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but
   bladder scan showed almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.
   Urology replaced foley.
   Anemia
   Lost some blood in urine and with burst a-line. Not immediately
   concerning and no obvious site of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow HCt
   FEN/GI
   Now extubated and OG removed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Physical Examination
   Early this a.m.
   Physical examination notable for profound sedation (propofol is at 60
   and failed RSBI). No spinal reflexes whatever. No response to pain. No
   spontaneous movement. Slight exotropia. Corneal reflexes intact (both
   eyes blink now). Pupillary response to light (3 mm) present (to 2 mm)
   but not maintained.
   Later after sedation weaned
   Patient with purposeful behavior, verbally interactive
 able to answer
   simple questions. Right nystagmus on right lateral gaze. Able to move
   all limbs to command. Facial movement symmetric. No further cognitive
   testing
 will reevaluate this p.m.
   Examination from yesterday:
   Spontaneous purposeless movement, in [**Location (un) 408**]-J collar, itubated on
   pressure support, tube feeds not running, urine dark with some sediment
   Patient looks stated age and overweight.
   Scleral edema present, no icterus, some spontaneous facial movement.
   Neck
 actually moving within collar, but cannot assess JVP, tone, LAD,
   etc.
   Thorax of normal appearance, symmetric expansion, clear anteriorly and
   laterally, no area of reduced breath sounds.
   Heart sounds dual, no S3/4, no M/R. Cardiac percussion reveals normal
   span with some dullness also over PMI.
   Abdomen benign
 soft, resonant, bowel sounds present (normal).
   Peripheral pulses (radial and dorsalis pedis) normal.
   Patient opened eyes and fixated on mine with sternal rub along with
   saying
[**Known firstname **]
. Did not follow commands to lift arms or close hands.
   Tone normal in arms and legs. Spontaneous movement of CN III, IV, V,
   VI, VII, [**Doctor First Name **], all limbs. Gag present (and results in increased movement
   of neck, face, limbs) when suctioned. Sluggish blink to confrontation,
   sluggish and small corneals bilaterally, pupils reactive (4->2 mm),
   biceps and brachioradialis not elicitable today, but knees brisk and
   plantar stimulation with withdrawal. No response to nail bed pressure
   or taking blood gas.

   Imaging: MRI head:
   Our prelim read: Leucoaraiosis, most marked around ventricles, some
   atrophy with enlarged ventricles, stable from CT. Comparison to CT
   reveals no notable edema. No obvious hypoperfusion injury (water-shed)
   or anoxic injury.
   Microbiology: Sputum culture reveals typical commensurate growth. GPCs
   in clusters seen on gram stain.
   Telemetry
 short runs of VT as above.
   Assessment
     This 66-year-old man with angina, perioral cyanosis on exertion,
   without past medical attention presents after collapsing at home. Given
   moaning and then likely VF on AED, and upon enzymes, EKG, it seems
   likely that he suffered an AMI/ACS which resulted in VT/VF and
   collapse. CPR was given at the scene, with some signs of neurologic
   injury at early presentation
 absent papillary reflexes and posturing.
   However, he has continued to reestablish function rapidly during the
   stay and his examination and progress today is particularly
   encouraging. Neurological signs noted yesterday were likely in part
   false localizing given sedation. He is now extubated. Now that his
   prognosis is looking good from a neurologic standpoint, it will be
   important to further work up in coronary artery disease.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   As above
 likely ACS with subsequent VF. Will need catheterization,
   A1c, lipids, likely statin, beta-blocker, +/- ACE. Will ensure that
   aspiration risk is low and mental status is good prior to cath to
   reduce chance of aspiration.
   - Continue present medication regimen.
   Mental Status
   Given rapid improvement in Neurologic exam, prognosis will now be good.
   Still possible damage to vulnerable structures, particularly
   hippocampus. MRI reveals leukoariaosis but no evident recent
   infarction.
   - Appreciate input from Neurology and continue to examine.
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care, infiltrate
   Very bad RSBI this a.m. [**3-16**] propofol that had been increased for MRI
   yesterday. Extubated during rounds this a.m.
   Hypertension
   Pressures to 170s mmHg not immediately concerning. Allow to
   autoregulate and then control gently.
   - Will start ACE, calcium channel blocker.
   Low urine output/obstruction/ARF
   Renal failure resolving. Was likely mild ATN with brief obstructive
   nephropathy. Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially
   responded, but then dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but
   bladder scan showed almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.
   Urology replaced foley.
   Anemia
   Lost some blood in urine and with burst a-line. Not immediately
   concerning and no obvious site of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow HCt
   FEN/GI
   Now extubated and OG removed.
   - Speech and swallow assessment this afternoon
   - Restore diet based on those recommendations

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man who suffered a likely VF arrest and was resuscitated. He has been in the ICU for several days and has undergone various tests and treatments.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 90 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 107/89 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (bpm)
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's neurological examination is notable for:

* Profound sedation (propofol 60 mcg/kg/min)
* No spinal reflexes
* No response to pain
* No spontaneous movement
* Slight exotropia
* Corneal reflexes intact (both eyes blink now)
* Pupillary response to light present (3 mm) but not maintained

The patient's medical history is significant for angina, perioral cyanosis on exertion, and no past medical attention. He has been diagnosed with a likely acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and coronary artery disease.

The patient's current medications include:

* Propofol (60 mcg/kg/min)
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Azithromycin
* Vancomycin
* Piperacillin
* Heparin (SQ UF)
* Famotidine (H2 blocker)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.1-7.0 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 31.4-31.6%
* Platelet count: 133-162 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.1-1.6 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.67 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 4.0 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Leukoaraiosis on MRI head, most marked around ventricles, with some atrophy and enlarged ventricles
* No obvious hypoperfusion injury or anoxic injury

The patient's plan includes:

* Cardiorespiratory arrest: likely ACS with subsequent VF, will need catheterization, A1c, lipids, likely statin, beta-blocker, +/- ACE
* Mental status: given rapid improvement in neurological exam, prognosis will now be good, but still possible damage to vulnerable structures
* Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care, infiltrate: very bad RSBI this a.m., extubated during rounds this a.m.
* Hypertension: pressures to 170s mmHg not immediately concerning, will start ACE, calcium channel blocker
* Low urine output/obstruction/ARF: renal failure resolving, was likely mild ATN with brief obstructive nephropathy
* Anemia: lost some blood in urine and with burst a-line, not immediately concerning and no obvious site of active bleeding
* FEN/GI: now extubated and OG removed, speech and swallow assessment this afternoon, restore diet based on those recommendations

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis: given the patient's history of VF arrest and the presence of a central line, there is a risk of sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: the patient's RSBI is still very bad, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if not managed properly.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: the patient has a history of VF arrest and may be at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
* Renal failure: the patient has a history of renal failure and may be at risk for further deterioration.
* Neurological damage: the patient has a history of VF arrest and may have suffered neurological damage, which could lead to further complications.
* Infection: the patient has a central line and may be at risk for infection.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: the patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and may be at risk for further bleeding.
* Respiratory failure: the patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if not managed properly."

   Physical Examination
   Early this a.m.
   Physical examination notable for profound sedation (propofol is at 60
   and failed RSBI). No spinal reflexes whatever. No response to pain. No
   spontaneous movement. Slight exotropia. Corneal reflexes intact (both
   eyes blink now). Pupillary response to light (3 mm) present (to 2 mm)
   but not maintained.
   Later after sedation weaned
   Patient with purposeful behavior, verbally interactive
 able to answer
   simple questions. Right nystagmus on right lateral gaze. Able to move
   all limbs to command. Facial movement symmetric. No further cognitive
   testing
 will reevaluate this p.m.
   Examination from yesterday:
   Spontaneous purposeless movement, in [**Location (un) 408**]-J collar, itubated on
   pressure support, tube feeds not running, urine dark with some sediment
   Patient looks stated age and overweight.
   Scleral edema present, no icterus, some spontaneous facial movement.
   Neck
 actually moving within collar, but cannot assess JVP, tone, LAD,
   etc.
   Thorax of normal appearance, symmetric expansion, clear anteriorly and
   laterally, no area of reduced breath sounds.
   Heart sounds dual, no S3/4, no M/R. Cardiac percussion reveals normal
   span with some dullness also over PMI.
   Abdomen benign
 soft, resonant, bowel sounds present (normal).
   Peripheral pulses (radial and dorsalis pedis) normal.
   Patient opened eyes and fixated on mine with sternal rub along with
   saying
[**Known firstname **]
. Did not follow commands to lift arms or close hands.
   Tone normal in arms and legs. Spontaneous movement of CN III, IV, V,
   VI, VII, [**Doctor First Name **], all limbs. Gag present (and results in increased movement
   of neck, face, limbs) when suctioned. Sluggish blink to confrontation,
   sluggish and small corneals bilaterally, pupils reactive (4->2 mm),
   biceps and brachioradialis not elicitable today, but knees brisk and
   plantar stimulation with withdrawal. No response to nail bed pressure
   or taking blood gas.

   or anoxic injury.
   Microbiology: Sputum culture reveals typical commensurate growth. GPCs

   Telemetry
 short runs of VT as above.
   Assessment
     This 66-year-old man with angina, perioral cyanosis on exertion,
   without past medical attention presents after collapsing at home. Given
   moaning and then likely VF on AED, and upon enzymes, EKG, it seems
   likely that he suffered an AMI/ACS which resulted in VT/VF and
   collapse. CPR was given at the scene, with some signs of neurologic
   injury at early presentation
 absent papillary reflexes and posturing.
   However, he has continued to reestablish function rapidly during the
   stay and his examination and progress today is particularly
   encouraging. Neurological signs noted yesterday were likely in part
   false localizing given sedation. He is now extubated. Now that his
   prognosis is looking good from a neurologic standpoint, it will be
   important to further work up in coronary artery disease.
   Plan
   Cardiorespiratory Arrest
   As above
 likely ACS with subsequent VF. Will need catheterization,
   A1c, lipids, likely statin, beta-blocker, +/- ACE. Will ensure that
   aspiration risk is low and mental status is good prior to cath to
   reduce chance of aspiration.
   - Continue present medication regimen.
   Mental Status
   Given rapid improvement in Neurologic exam, prognosis will now be good.
   Still possible damage to vulnerable structures, particularly
   hippocampus. MRI reveals leukoariaosis but no evident recent
   infarction.
   - Appreciate input from Neurology and continue to examine.
   Intubation, respiratory failure, critical care, infiltrate
   Very bad RSBI this a.m. [**3-16**] propofol that had been increased for MRI
   yesterday. Extubated during rounds this a.m.
   Hypertension
   Pressures to 170s mmHg not immediately concerning. Allow to
   autoregulate and then control gently.
   - Will start ACE, calcium channel blocker.
   Low urine output/obstruction/ARF
   Renal failure resolving. Was likely mild ATN with brief obstructive
   nephropathy. Was bolused x 2 for low urine output that initially
   responded, but then dropped off.  Fena and feurea were prerenal, but
   bladder scan showed almost a liter in bladder.  Pt uncomfortable.
   Urology replaced foley.
   Anemia
   Lost some blood in urine and with burst a-line. Not immediately
   concerning and no obvious site of active bleeding.
   - Guaiac stools
   - Follow HCt
   FEN/GI
   Now extubated and OG removed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man who presented with likely VF arrest and subsequent CPR at the scene. He has a history of angina and perioral cyanosis on exertion, but no prior medical attention.

The patient's condition has been rapidly improving, with notable progress in his neurological examination. He is now extubated and able to respond to simple questions, move all limbs to command, and exhibit facial movement. However, there are still concerns regarding potential brain stem infarct and possible damage to vulnerable structures, particularly the hippocampus.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of angina and likely ACS, there is a risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or further myocardial infarction.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is still uncertain, and there is a risk of further damage to the brain or spinal cord.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient is now extubated, but there is still a risk of respiratory failure or complications related to his previous respiratory failure.
4. Renal complications: The patient's urine output is still low, and there is a risk of further kidney damage or failure.
5. Infectious complications: The patient's sputum culture revealed typical commensurate growth, and there is a risk of further infection.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient has lost some blood in urine and with burst a-line, and there is a risk of further bleeding.

The plan for the patient's care includes:

1. Cardiac catheterization to further evaluate coronary artery disease.
2. Medication regimen to include a statin, beta-blocker, and potentially ACE inhibitor.
3. Further neurological evaluation and monitoring.
4. Renal function monitoring and management of low urine output.
5. Infection control measures, including DVT prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
6. Pain management and bowel regimen.

Overall, the patient's condition is improving, but there are still several potential complications that need to be monitored and managed."
