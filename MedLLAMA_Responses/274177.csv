   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 78 yoM w/ a h/o metastatic prostate cancer and
   paroxsymal afib presents with worsening back pain, found to have
   thrombocytopenia, anemia, severe acute renal failure, questionable
   somnolence as well as afib with RVR- admitted to the ICU as he was
   requiring a diltiazem drip for rate control.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: very significant acute renal failure with a Cr
   of 5.6 which was 0.9 four days prior.  BUN 100.  In the setting of low
   platelets TTP or HUS would be high on the differential and would have a
   high risk of mortality without plasmapharesis.
   - calculated FeNa: 5.4, suggestive of ATN
   -upon read of the smear, per blood bank attending unable to appreciate
   many schistocytes and did not appear as a typical picture for TTP
   -renal u/s negative for hydro; difficulty in inserting foley catheter
   suggests possible obstruction or stricture.  Bladder scan showed 800ccs
   in the bladder, patient reportedly incontinent overnight.  Patient
   refuses further catheter attempts.  Have spoken to urology.  Will need
   to discuss again this AM regarding patient wishes.
   -LDH elevated at 554, haptoglobin low at <20.
   -renal consult, will see this AM.  Did not believe that patient was in
   need of dialysis
   -check CK in case of rhabdo given large blood and only [**4-13**] RBCs in
   urine (which could be hemoglobin or myoglobin): 223
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: unclear cause.  On cycle 12 of his chemo regimen
   which could possibly cause thrombocytopenia however he has not suffered
   thrombocytopenia in the past.  TTP/HUS are high on the differential due
   to unexplained thrombocytopenia and evidence of microangiopathic
   hemolytic anemia.  In addition DIC is also on the differential but
   lower.  An isolated cause (unrelated to his ARF) is possible such as
   ITP but is less likely.
   -smear for schistocytes; some detected by heme/onc fellow, but with
   review with blood bank attending, were strongly arguing against TTP.
   -hematology consult.  Initial thought was possible TTP.  Sent for
   ADAMTS13 Activity.
   -LDH 554, haptoglobin decreased.
   -fibrinogen: 395 WNL, so DIC less likely
   .
   # Anemia: slightly lower than baseline, as above will send hemolysis
   labs.
   -trend hct: 26.9 down from 32.1 five days ago
   -baseline is in the low 30s and based on iron studies from [**5-18**]
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  No B12 or folate labs in
   [**Last Name (LF) 1337**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] send in a.m.
   .
   # Afib with RVR:
   -given low platelets will hold coumadin for now, restart if plts
   improve and if low liklihood of any procedures
   -rate control with dilt ineffective, responded well to IV lopressor and
   now on  PO 25mg metoprolol TID
   .
   # somnolence: per wife, patient has been more somnolent over the last 4
   days.  Here, able to carry a conversation appropriately.  Consider as
   part of TTP presentation vs. increasing BUN.
   # Back pain: associated with a few months of lower extremity weakness.
   Last imaging of his spine was [**5-18**] with an MRI of his C, T and L spine
   which demonstrated diffuse metastasis to the spine and no cord
   compression.
   -will obtain repeat MRI of L, T, C spine without contrast (given ARF)
   -oxycontin 10mg po tid with prn PO oxycodone and prn IV dilaudid prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has severe acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 5.6 mg/dL, which is a significant increase from the previous level of 0.9 mg/dL. This may lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased mortality.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage. This may be due to TTP/HUS, ITP, or other causes.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is slightly lower than baseline, which may lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and other symptoms.
4. Afib with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) may lead to further complications such as stroke, heart failure, and increased mortality.
5. Somnolence: The patient's somnolence may be due to TTP, increasing BUN, or other causes. This may impact their ability to communicate and respond to treatment.
6. Back pain: The patient's back pain may be related to metastatic prostate cancer or other underlying conditions.
7. Incontinence: The patient's incontinence may be due to urinary retention or other causes, which may lead to further complications such as urinary tract infections and skin breakdown.
8. Difficulty placing foley catheter: The patient's difficulty placing a foley catheter may be due to obstruction or stricture, which may lead to further complications such as urinary retention and infection.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continuing to monitor and manage ARF.
2. Investigating the cause of thrombocytopenia and anemia.
3. Managing Afib with RVR with rate control medications.
4. Monitoring the patient's somnolence and adjusting treatment as needed.
5. Managing the patient's back pain with pain medications.
6. Discussing further management of incontinence with the patient and urology.
7. Repeating MRI of the spine without contrast to assess for cord compression.
8. Continuing to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjusting treatment as needed.

The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is pending clinical improvement."

   paroxsymal afib presents with worsening back pain, found to have
   thrombocytopenia, anemia, severe acute renal failure, questionable
   somnolence as well as afib with RVR- admitted to the ICU as he was
   requiring a diltiazem drip for rate control.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: very significant acute renal failure with a Cr
   of 5.6 which was 0.9 four days prior.  BUN 100.  In the setting of low
   platelets TTP or HUS would be high on the differential and would have a
   high risk of mortality without plasmapharesis.
   - calculated FeNa: 5.4, suggestive of ATN
   -upon read of the smear, per blood bank attending unable to appreciate
   many schistocytes and did not appear as a typical picture for TTP
   -renal u/s negative for hydro; difficulty in inserting foley catheter
   suggests possible obstruction or stricture.  Bladder scan showed 800ccs
   in the bladder, patient reportedly incontinent overnight.  Patient
   refuses further catheter attempts.  Have spoken to urology.  Will need
   to discuss again this AM regarding patient wishes.
   -LDH elevated at 554, haptoglobin low at <20.
   -renal consult, will see this AM.  Did not believe that patient was in
   need of dialysis
   -check CK in case of rhabdo given large blood and only [**4-13**] RBCs in
   urine (which could be hemoglobin or myoglobin): 223
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: unclear cause.  On cycle 12 of his chemo regimen
   which could possibly cause thrombocytopenia however he has not suffered
   thrombocytopenia in the past.  TTP/HUS are high on the differential due
   to unexplained thrombocytopenia and evidence of microangiopathic
   hemolytic anemia.  In addition DIC is also on the differential but
   lower.  An isolated cause (unrelated to his ARF) is possible such as
   ITP but is less likely.
   -smear for schistocytes; some detected by heme/onc fellow, but with
   review with blood bank attending, were strongly arguing against TTP.
   -hematology consult.  Initial thought was possible TTP.  Sent for
   ADAMTS13 Activity.
   -LDH 554, haptoglobin decreased.
   -fibrinogen: 395 WNL, so DIC less likely

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, who was admitted to the ICU due to worsening back pain, thrombocytopenia, anemia, severe acute renal failure, and questionable somnolence.

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring. The potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

1. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is 5.6 mg/dL, which indicates severe acute renal failure. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and uremia if not managed promptly.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 59 K/uL, which is low. This can increase the risk of bleeding and may require platelet transfusions.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.0 g/dL, which is slightly lower than baseline. This can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, which can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
5. Somnolence: The patient's somnolence may be related to his underlying condition or medications, and may require further evaluation and management.
6. Back Pain: The patient's back pain may be related to his metastatic prostate cancer and may require further evaluation and management.
7. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is 690 mL, which is higher than the recommended amount. This can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiovascular instability.
8. Respiratory Compromise: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 98%. This may require further evaluation and management.
9. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is 9.7 K/uL, which is slightly elevated. This may indicate an underlying infection, which requires further evaluation and management.
10. Metabolic Complications: The patient's electrolyte levels, including potassium, sodium, and phosphorus, are abnormal. This may require further evaluation and management to prevent metabolic complications.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, anemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, somnolence, back pain, fluid overload, respiratory compromise, infection, and metabolic complications. Close monitoring and management are required to prevent these complications and improve the patient's outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 78-year-old man with a history of metastatic prostate cancer and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) who was admitted to the ICU for worsening back pain, thrombocytopenia, anemia, severe acute renal failure (ARF), and AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient was previously on a diltiazem drip for rate control, but it was ineffective, and he was given IV lopressor, which responded well. The patient is currently on PO metoprolol TID for rate control.

The patient has been experiencing somnolence, which is a concern, and has a low platelet count. The differential diagnosis for thrombocytopenia includes TTP/HUS, DIC, and ITP. The patient's hematology consult has sent for ADAMTS13 activity to rule out TTP. The patient's renal function is severely impaired, with a creatinine level of 5.6 mg/dL, and he has a significant amount of urine output.

The patient's anemia is slightly lower than baseline, and the patient's hemolysis labs are pending. The patient's fibrinogen level is within normal limits, making DIC less likely. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and he is receiving regular diet.

The patient's back pain is associated with lower extremity weakness, and he has a history of diffuse metastasis to the spine on MRI. The patient's pain is being managed with oxycontin and prn PO oxycodone and IV dilaudid.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Further worsening of ARF, leading to dialysis dependence and increased mortality.
2. Development of sepsis, which can exacerbate the patient's underlying conditions.
3. Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, which can be life-threatening.
4. Further decline in the patient's respiratory function, which can lead to respiratory failure.
5. Increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's underlying AF and RVR.
6. Development of rhabdomyolysis due to the patient's large blood transfusions and decreased renal function.
7. Increased risk of infection due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and ARF.

The patient's code status is full code, and his family has been informed of his condition. The patient's daughter has asked to be informed of his status, and the patient's step-mother is present with him."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 78 yoM w/ a h/o metastatic prostate cancer and
   paroxsymal afib presents with worsening back pain, found to have
   thrombocytopenia, anemia, severe acute renal failure, questionable
   somnolence as well as afib with RVR- admitted to the ICU as he was
   requiring a diltiazem drip for rate control.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: very significant acute renal failure with a Cr
   of 5.6 which was 0.9 four days prior.  BUN 100.  In the setting of low
   platelets, decreased hct, and possible mild mental changes, suspicion
   for TTP or HUS was high.  However, per renal, urinary sediment showed
   brown muddy casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis.  Further,
   smear underwhelming for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, making TTP
   less likely.  Cause of ATN unclear, but insult likely occurred on
   [**2147-10-17**].  No need for RRT at this time.
   - calculated FeNa: 5.4, suggestive of ATN
   - monitor platelets, peripheral smears
   - IVF as necessary
   - followed by heme onc
   - renal u/s negative for hydro; difficulty in inserting foley catheter
   suggests possible obstruction or stricture.  Bladder scan showed 800ccs
   in the bladder, patient reportedly incontinent overnight.  Patient
   refuses further catheter attempts.  Have spoken to urology.
   - LDH elevated at 554, haptoglobin low at <20 suggests hemolysis
   pattern but hct fairly stable
   - renal following
   - heme onc following
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: unclear cause, may be secondary taxotare.  On cycle
   12 of his chemo regimen which could possibly cause thrombocytopenia
   however he has not suffered thrombocytopenia in the past.  TTP/HUS are
   high on the differential due to unexplained thrombocytopenia and
   evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.  In addition DIC is less
   likely.  An isolated cause (unrelated to his ARF) is possible such as
   ITP but is less likely.
   -hematology consult.  Initial thought was possible TTP, but less likely
   as above.  Sent for ADAMTS13 Activity.
   -fibrinogen: 395 WNL, so DIC less likely
   .
   # Anemia: slightly lower than baseline, as above will send hemolysis
   labs.
   -trend hct: 26.9 down from 32.1 five days ago
   -baseline is in the low 30s and based on iron studies from [**5-18**]
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  No B12 or folate labs in
   [**Last Name (LF) 1337**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] send in a.m.
   .
   # Afib with RVR: rate well controlled, HR < 100
   -given low platelets will hold coumadin for now, restart if plts
   improve and if low liklihood of any procedures
   -rate control with dilt ineffective, responded well to IV lopressor and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU for rate control and treatment of worsening back pain, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and severe acute renal failure.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.6°C (96.1°F)
* Heart rate: 94 bpm (normal range: 60-100 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 137/75 mmHg (normal range: 90-140/60-90 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 17 inspirations per minute (normal range: 12-20 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 98% (normal range: 95-100%)
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response

The patient's laboratory results are:

* White blood cell count: 9.7 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4-11 x 10^9/L)
* Hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL (normal range: 13-17 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 60 x 10^9/L (normal range: 150-450 x 10^9/L)
* Creatinine: 5.6 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 100 mg/dL (normal range: 7-20 mg/dL)
* Lactate dehydrogenase: 554 IU/L (normal range: 100-250 IU/L)
* Haptoglobin: <20 mg/dL (normal range: 30-200 mg/dL)

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Alert and oriented
* Tachycardic and irregularly irregular heart rhythm
* Soft and non-tender abdomen with mild to moderate distension
* No rebound tenderness or guarding
* No organomegaly
* Warm and well-perfused extremities
* Neurological examination is normal

The patient's medical history is significant for metastatic prostate cancer, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and a recent chemotherapy regimen.

The patient's current medications are:

* Diltiazem drip
* Lopressor 5mg IV
* Metoprolol 25mg PO TID
* Oxycontin 10mg PO TID
* IV dilaudid as needed
* Prophylactic antibiotics for possible LLL pneumonia

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitor platelets, peripheral smears, and IV fluids as necessary
* Follow-up with hematology and renal consults
* Repeat MRI of the spine without contrast to evaluate for cord compression
* Continue pain management with oxycontin and IV dilaudid as needed
* Monitor for decompensation and reinitiate antibiotics if necessary
* Hold coumadin for now and restart if platelet count improves and low likelihood of procedures

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to severe acute renal failure
* Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) due to unexplained thrombocytopenia and evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and thrombocytopenia
* Respiratory failure due to sepsis or pneumonia
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation and tachycardia
* Sepsis or septic shock due to infection
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer or anticoagulation therapy"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   with worsening back pain, found to have thrombocytopenia, anemia,
   severe acute renal failure, questionable somnolence as well as afib
   with RVR- admitted to the ICU as he was requiring a diltiazem drip for
   rate control.

   # Acute renal failure: very significant acute renal failure with a Cr
   of 5.6 which was 0.9 four days prior.  BUN 100.  In the setting of low
   platelets, decreased hct, and possible mild mental changes, suspicion
   for TTP or HUS was high.  However, per renal, urinary sediment showed
   brown muddy casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis.  Further,
   smear underwhelming for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, making TTP
   less likely.  Cause of ATN unclear, but insult likely occurred on
   [**2147-10-17**].  No need for RRT at this time.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and currently admitted to the ICU for acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and possible somnolence.

The patient's condition is complicated by acute tubular necrosis (ATN) with unclear cause, which is not related to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The patient's renal function is severely impaired, with a creatinine level of 5.6 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 100 mg/dL.

The patient's thrombocytopenia is unclear, but may be secondary to his chemotherapy regimen, taxotare, or possibly idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The patient's anemia is also unclear, but may be related to anemia of chronic disease or possibly vitamin B12 deficiency.

The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) is well-controlled with rate-controlling medications, but the patient's low platelet count may require holding coumadin therapy.

The patient's back pain is associated with lower extremity weakness and may be related to metastatic disease in the spine. The patient's spine MRI from [**5-18**] showed diffuse metastasis without cord compression.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Progressive renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is already 5.6 mg/dL, and further deterioration could lead to end-stage renal disease.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and further decline could lead to bleeding complications.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased cardiac output.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's AFib with RVR may worsen, leading to heart failure, stroke, or other cardiovascular complications.
5. Metastatic disease: The patient's metastatic disease in the spine may worsen, leading to cord compression or other complications.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and indwelling catheters may increase the risk of infection.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
9. Cardiac failure: The patient's heart failure may worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output and increased risk of death.

To manage these potential complications, the patient's care should focus on:

1. Monitoring renal function and adjusting therapy accordingly.
2. Managing thrombocytopenia and anemia with platelet transfusions and iron supplementation.
3. Controlling atrial fibrillation with rate-controlling medications and considering cardioversion.
4. Managing metastatic disease with palliative care and symptom management.
5. Preventing infection with antimicrobial prophylaxis and strict infection control measures.
6. Monitoring for gastrointestinal bleeding and taking measures to prevent it.
7. Managing respiratory and cardiac failure with oxygen therapy, diuretics, and other medications as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yoM w/ a h/o metastatic prostate cancer and paroxsymal afib presents
   with worsening back pain, found to have thrombocytopenia, anemia,
   severe acute renal failure, questionable somnolence as well as afib
   with RVR- admitted to the ICU as he was requiring a diltiazem drip for
   rate control.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: very significant acute renal failure with a Cr
   of 5.6 which was 0.9 four days prior.  BUN 100.  In the setting of low
   platelets, decreased hct, and possible mild mental changes, suspicion
   for TTP or HUS was high.  However, per renal, urinary sediment showed
   brown muddy casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis.  Further,
   smear underwhelming for microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, making TTP
   less likely.  Cause of ATN unclear, but insult likely occurred on
   [**2147-10-17**].  No need for RRT at this time.
   - calculated FeNa: 5.4, suggestive of ATN
   - monitor platelets, peripheral smears
   - IVF as necessary
   - followed by heme onc
   - renal u/s negative for hydro; difficulty in inserting foley catheter
   suggests possible obstruction or stricture.  Bladder scan showed 800ccs
   in the bladder, patient reportedly incontinent overnight.  Patient
   refuses further catheter attempts.  Have spoken to urology.
   - LDH elevated at 554, haptoglobin low at <20 suggests hemolysis
   pattern but hct fairly stable
   - renal following
   - heme onc following
   .
   # thrombocytopenia: unclear cause, may be secondary taxotare.  On cycle
   12 of his chemo regimen which could possibly cause thrombocytopenia
   however he has not suffered thrombocytopenia in the past.  TTP/HUS are
   high on the differential due to unexplained thrombocytopenia and
   evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.  In addition DIC is less
   likely.  An isolated cause (unrelated to his ARF) is possible such as
   ITP but is less likely.
   -hematology consult.  Initial thought was possible TTP, but less likely
   as above.  Sent for ADAMTS13 Activity.
   -fibrinogen: 395 WNL, so DIC less likely
   .
   # Anemia: slightly lower than baseline, as above will send hemolysis
   labs.
   -trend hct: 26.9 down from 32.1 five days ago
   -baseline is in the low 30s and based on iron studies from [**5-18**]
   consistent with anemia of chronic disease.  No B12 or folate labs in
   [**Last Name (LF) 1337**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] send in a.m.
   .
   # Afib with RVR: rate well controlled, HR < 100
   -given low platelets will hold coumadin for now, restart if plts
   improve and if low liklihood of any procedures
   -rate control with dilt ineffective, responded well to IV lopressor and
   now on PO 25mg metoprolol TID
   .
   # Back pain: associated with a few months of lower extremity weakness.
   Last imaging of his spine was [**5-18**] with an MRI of his C, T and L spine
   which demonstrated diffuse metastasis to the spine and no cord
   compression.
   -will obtain repeat MRI of L, T, C spine without contrast (given ARF)
   -oxycontin 10mg po tid with prn PO oxycodone and prn IV dilaudid prn
   pain, will calculate requirements and increase doses on a daily bases

   # question of LLL Pna: was started empirically on levofloxacin 250mg PO
   daily, but given lack of fever, leukocytosis, cough, or other clinical

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of metastatic prostate cancer, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and a recent diagnosis of acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to the severity of his condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, and blood pressure of 105/71 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 96%. His physical examination is notable for tachycardia, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, and mild to moderate distension of the abdomen.

The patient's laboratory results show significant abnormalities, including:

* Thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 60,000/μL)
* Anemia (hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL)
* Severe acute renal failure (creatinine of 5.6 mg/dL)
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 554 IU/L
* Low haptoglobin of <20
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 100 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) as the likely cause of ARF
* Thrombocytopenia, possibly secondary to chemotherapy or an underlying bleeding disorder
* Anemia, possibly secondary to chronic disease or blood loss
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), requiring rate control
* Back pain, possibly related to metastatic disease or spinal compression
* Questionable somnolence, possibly related to anemia, ARF, or medication side effects

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further decline in renal function, potentially requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT)
* Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia
* Infection, potentially secondary to urinary tract obstruction or other underlying conditions
* Cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure, due to atrial fibrillation and underlying cardiovascular disease
* Neurological complications, such as seizures or altered mental status, due to anemia, ARF, or medication side effects

Based on the patient's condition and laboratory results, the following plan is recommended:

* Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment accordingly
* Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and bleeding risk
* Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust treatment accordingly
* Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust rate control measures as necessary
* Obtain a repeat MRI of the spine to assess for spinal compression or metastatic disease
* Consider further imaging studies, such as a CT scan or ultrasound, to assess for potential causes of ARF and urinary tract obstruction
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust treatment accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with history of prostate cancer with metastases who now
   presents with a combination of acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia,
   atrial fibrillation and intermittent altered mental status.  A single
   unifying diagnosis has been hard to determine as TTP/HUS appears much
   less likely at this time.  Source of ATN does appear to be present but
   without significant obstruction, ischemia
   1)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Will need CT scan final read but obstruction not seen up on our review
   of images
   -Will have to continue to maintain adequate volume status and monitor
   urine flow
   -We do appreciate guidance from renal team in the setting of persistent
   and increased Cr
   -Will need foley catheter placement by Urology
would favor improvement
   in INR and consideration of DDAVP peri-procedure based upon urology
   bias.
   -Dialysis likely to be needed in near term and will have to discuss
   2)Atrial Fibrillation_Reasonable control of rate across time with
   implementation of beta-blocker treatment.
   -Continue titration of beta-blocker therapy
   -Goal rate control at <100 bpm
   -Coumadin held but INR persistently elevated.
   3)Thrombocytopenia-Patient has shown trend to increase across time
   without intervention
   -Continue to trend [**Hospital1 **]
   -No role for transfusion at this time
   4)Anemia--Has been stable HCT across time in ICU without evidence of
   further hemolysis by HCT/Hgb at least.  T. Bili is normal
   -Follow HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   5)Prostate Cancer-
   -Appreciate Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4593**]
s input, will continue to provide supportive Rx.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 yo male with history of prostate cancer with metastases who now
   presents with a combination of acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia,
   atrial fibrillation and intermittent altered mental status.  A single
   unifying diagnosis has been hard to determine as TTP/HUS appears much
   less likely at this time.  Source of ATN does appear to be present but
   without significant obstruction, ischemia
   1)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Will need CT scan final read but obstruction not seen up on our review
   of images
   -Will have to continue to maintain adequate volume status and monitor
   urine flow
   -We do appreciate guidance from renal team in the setting of persistent
   and increased Cr
   -Will need foley catheter placement by Urology
would favor improvement
   in INR and consideration of DDAVP peri-procedure based upon urology
   bias.
   -Dialysis likely to be needed in near term and will have to discuss
   2)Atrial Fibrillation_Reasonable control of rate across time with
   implementation of beta-blocker treatment.
   -Continue titration of beta-blocker therapy
   -Goal rate control at <100 bpm
   -Coumadin held but INR persistently elevated.
   3)Thrombocytopenia-Patient has shown trend to increase across time
   without intervention
   -Continue to trend [**Hospital1 **]
   -No role for transfusion at this time
   4)Anemia--Has been stable HCT across time in ICU without evidence of
   further hemolysis by HCT/Hgb at least.  T. Bili is normal
   -Follow HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   5)Prostate Cancer-
   -Appreciate Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4593**]
s input, will continue to provide supportive Rx.

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer and metastases who presents with a combination of acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, and intermittent altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 108/73 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 94% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no obvious source of bleeding. His cardiovascular examination is notable for an irregularly irregular rhythm, and his peripheral vascular examination is notable for trace bilateral lower extremity edema.

The patient's laboratory results show a platelet count of 84 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, and a creatinine level of 5.6 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and his coagulation studies are normal.

The patient's imaging studies, including a CT scan of the renal collecting system, show no evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter. His chest X-ray shows a small blunting of the left side.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Acute renal failure: The patient will need to continue to maintain adequate volume status and monitor urine flow. A foley catheter will be placed by urology, and dialysis will likely be needed in the near future.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rate will be controlled with beta-blocker therapy, and his INR will be monitored.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count will be trended, and transfusion will be considered if necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level will be monitored, and transfusion will be considered if necessary.
5. Prostate cancer: The patient will continue to receive supportive care for his underlying condition.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and his urine output is decreased, which may indicate AKI.
2. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase his risk of bleeding, especially if he undergoes invasive procedures.
3. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and decreased platelet count may increase his risk of infection.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as stroke or myocardial infarction.
5. Dialysis complications: The patient's need for dialysis may increase his risk of complications, such as bleeding or infection.

The patient's disposition is planned for transfer to the floor with reasonable capacity to monitor urine flow and continued stability of heart rate."
