 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 LEUKOCYTOSIS
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   83 year old female with history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial
   bacteremia from cholangitis presenting with sepsis from likely RUQ
   source, now improving.
   1. Sepsis: at OSH, hypotensive with leukocytosis and polymicrobial
   bacteremia. Currently with E. coli, Klebsiella, GPC and an additional
   GNR growing from blood cultures. Has negative UA/Urine culture and
   negative CXR for pneumonia. Source is likely biliary, concern for liver
   abscess on CT scan from [**2169-1-3**] from OSH.  She also had elevated TB/AP
   at OSH admission that trended to normal. Repeat CT abdomen to evaluate
   for interval change. OSH studies on CD/available for comparison.  No
   new data from OSH micro lab as of [**2169-1-5**] pm.  Will cover with Linezolid
   (given history of VRE bacteremia), gentamicin and Meropenem until
   sensitivities from OSH available.  Check gentamicin trough in am (last
   dose 6 am [**1-5**])  and continue previous dosing at 120 mg daily once level
   back.  Send blood cultures here and plan for surveillance cultures for
   next several days.   Plan also for ERCP for stent evaluation in am.
   Currently afebrile, HD stable.
   2. Atrial fibrillation:  PAF, currently in sinus with PACs. Continue
   digoxin for now as would prefer not to use medications which can affect
   BP in the peri-septic period.  Dilt IV as needed, optimize
   electrolytes.  CHADS score is 4, patient would warrant AC, but would
   not start until after ERCP completed.  Had been ordered for propafenone
   at OSH, but per [**Month (only) **], did not receive. Will not start.  Check digoxin
   level
   3. Thrombocytopenia: no evidence of splenomegaly on CT scan. Admission
   Plt count 243 and now 120 (OSH value was 93). A component of dilution
   expected, but ? related to critical illness vs. medication. TCP not
   associated with gentamicin or imipenem. She was receiving Lovenox and
   Vancomycin.
   4. NSTEMI:  positive troponin, ECG changes and elevated BNP at OSH
   (though clinical setting in which this was ordered is unclear).   [**Name2 (NI) 6**]
   LE edema and is on chronic Lasix at home (check LENIs in am). Lasix
   currently on hold.  ECG from [**2169-1-2**] to [**2169-1-3**] demonstrate a change
   in axis and co-incides with chills/rigors/shortness of breath noted in
   one of the consultant notes.  ECG here with new TWI V1-V4 and
   maintenance of new axis since [**1-2**]--cycle enzymes.  Check
   echocardiogram. Continue aspirin and statin.  Unclear why not on ace or
   beta blocker at home given history of CAD/CHF.  Recheck ECG in am.
   5. Parkinson's disease: continue Sinemet and Pramipexole at outpatient
   doses.
   6. Diabetes mellitus, type 2: SSI for now.
   7. Hyperlipidemia: continue Zocor
   8. Allergies: continue outpatient Singulair, albuterol nebs prn
   9. Acute renal failure: creatinine of 1.4 at OSH admission, now
   normalizing. Pre-renal etiology, now resolved
   10. Anemia: mild, lower values at OSH.  Will trend

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia from cholangitis, and sepsis from a likely RUQ source. She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation, leukocytosis, and altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis: progression to septic shock, multi-organ dysfunction, and death.
2. Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): further cardiac damage, arrhythmias, and increased risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: stroke, heart failure, and increased risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Leukocytosis: further bone marrow suppression, increased risk of infections, and potential for leukemia.
5. Altered Mental Status: progression to delirium, increased risk of falls, and potential for long-term cognitive impairment.
6. Thrombocytopenia: further bleeding complications, increased risk of hemorrhage, and potential for platelet dysfunction.
7. Acute Renal Failure: progression to chronic kidney disease, increased risk of electrolyte imbalances, and potential for dialysis dependence.

To mitigate these complications, the patient is being treated with antibiotics, anticoagulants, and other medications as needed. She is also being closely monitored for changes in her condition and is receiving supportive care in the ICU."

 LEUKOCYTOSIS
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   83 year old female with history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial
   bacteremia from cholangitis presenting with sepsis from likely RUQ
   source, now improving.
   1. Sepsis: at OSH, hypotensive with leukocytosis and polymicrobial
   bacteremia. Currently with E. coli, Klebsiella, GPC and an additional
   GNR growing from blood cultures. Has negative UA/Urine culture and
   negative CXR for pneumonia. Source is likely biliary, concern for liver
   abscess on CT scan from [**2169-1-3**] from OSH.  She also had elevated TB/AP
   at OSH admission that trended to normal. Repeat CT abdomen to evaluate
   for interval change. OSH studies on CD/available for comparison.  No
   new data from OSH micro lab as of [**2169-1-5**] pm.  Will cover with Linezolid
   (given history of VRE bacteremia), gentamicin and Meropenem until
   sensitivities from OSH available.  Check gentamicin trough in am (last
   dose 6 am [**1-5**])  and continue previous dosing at 120 mg daily once level
   back.  Send blood cultures here and plan for surveillance cultures for
   next several days.   Plan also for ERCP for stent evaluation in am.
   Currently afebrile, HD stable.
   2. Atrial fibrillation:  PAF, currently in sinus with PACs. Continue
   digoxin for now as would prefer not to use medications which can affect
   BP in the peri-septic period.  Dilt IV as needed, optimize
   electrolytes.  CHADS score is 4, patient would warrant AC, but would
   not start until after ERCP completed.  Had been ordered for propafenone
   at OSH, but per [**Month (only) **], did not receive. Will not start.  Check digoxin
   level
   3. Thrombocytopenia: no evidence of splenomegaly on CT scan. Admission
   Plt count 243 and now 120 (OSH value was 93). A component of dilution
   expected, but ? related to critical illness vs. medication. TCP not
   associated with gentamicin or imipenem. She was receiving Lovenox and
   Vancomycin.
   4. NSTEMI:  positive troponin, ECG changes and elevated BNP at OSH
   (though clinical setting in which this was ordered is unclear).   [**Name2 (NI) 6**]
   LE edema and is on chronic Lasix at home (check LENIs in am). Lasix
   currently on hold.  ECG from [**2169-1-2**] to [**2169-1-3**] demonstrate a change
   in axis and co-incides with chills/rigors/shortness of breath noted in
   one of the consultant notes.  ECG here with new TWI V1-V4 and
   maintenance of new axis since [**1-2**]--cycle enzymes.  Check
   echocardiogram. Continue aspirin and statin.  Unclear why not on ace or
   beta blocker at home given history of CAD/CHF.  Recheck ECG in am.
   5. Parkinson's disease: continue Sinemet and Pramipexole at outpatient
   doses.
   6. Diabetes mellitus, type 2: SSI for now.
   7. Hyperlipidemia: continue Zocor
   8. Allergies: continue outpatient Singulair, albuterol nebs prn
   9. Acute renal failure: creatinine of 1.4 at OSH admission, now
   normalizing. Pre-renal etiology, now resolved
   10. Anemia: mild, lower values at OSH.  Will trend

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia from cholangitis, and sepsis from a likely RUQ source. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently being treated with linezolid, gentamicin, and meropenem.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.4°C, heart rate of 65 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 144/59 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac injury. Her blood cultures have grown E. coli, Klebsiella, and GPC, and an additional GNR is growing.

The patient's medical conditions include sepsis, myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation, leukocytosis, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. She also has a history of Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and allergies.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: progression to septic shock, organ dysfunction, or death.
2. Myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): further cardiac damage, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
3. Atrial fibrillation: stroke, thromboembolism, or cardiac arrest.
4. Leukocytosis: leukopenia, neutropenia, or bone marrow suppression.
5. Thrombocytopenia: bleeding or bruising.
6. Acute renal failure: chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
7. Altered mental status: delirium, coma, or death.
8. Respiratory failure: pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or respiratory arrest.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Sepsis: continued treatment with antibiotics, fluid management, and monitoring for signs of septic shock.
2. Myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): continued treatment with aspirin and statin, and monitoring for signs of cardiac damage or heart failure.
3. Atrial fibrillation: continued treatment with digoxin and monitoring for signs of stroke or cardiac arrest.
4. Leukocytosis: monitoring for signs of leukopenia or neutropenia.
5. Thrombocytopenia: monitoring for signs of bleeding or bruising.
6. Acute renal failure: monitoring for signs of chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
7. Altered mental status: monitoring for signs of delirium or coma.
8. Respiratory failure: monitoring for signs of pneumonia, ARDS, or respiratory arrest.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

 LEUKOCYTOSIS
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   83 year old female with history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial
   bacteremia from cholangitis presenting with sepsis from likely RUQ
   source, now improving.
   1. Sepsis:
   At OSH, hypotensive with leukocytosis and polymicrobial bacteremia.
   Currently with E. coli, Klebsiella, GPC and an additional GNR growing
   from blood cultures. Has negative UA/Urine culture and negative CXR for
   pneumonia. Source is likely biliary, concern for liver abscess on CT
   scan from [**2169-1-3**] from OSH.  She also had elevated TB/AP at OSH
   admission that trended to normal. OSH studies on CD/available for
   comparison.
   - ERCP for evaluation of stents
   - CT abdomen to furthur investigate intra-abdominal processes,
   specifically potential of liver absecess vs. mets
   - Continue Linezolid, Meropenem, Gentamicin with gent dosed Q48H with a
   trough prior to each dose (most recent gent dose prior to admission was
   at 0600 on [**2169-1-5**].
   - Await final speciations and senstivities of OSH blood cultures
   - Follow-up speciation of blood cultures from admission
   - Wean antibiotics as indicated by culture data
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   2. Atrial fibrillation:
   Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, currently in sinus with PACs. Digoxin
   level returned yesterday as 3.5. Dilt IV as needed, optimize
   electrolytes.  CHADS score is 4, patient would warrant anticoagulation,
   though this issue is complicated by history of recent falls. In any
   case, would not start until after ERCP completed. Had been ordered for
   propafenone at OSH, but per [**Month (only) **], did not receive. Will not start.
   - Will hold for today and then continue start digoxin again tomorrow
   with lower weekly dose.
   3. Thrombocytopenia:
   No evidence of splenomegaly on CT scan. Admission Plt count 243 and now
   104 (OSH value was 93). A component of dilution expected, but ? related
   to critical illness vs. medication. Thrombocytopenia not associated
   with gentamicin or imipenem. She was receiving Lovenox and Vancomycin.
   4. NSTEMI:
   Positive troponin, ECG changes and elevated BNP at OSH (though clinical
   setting in which this was ordered is unclear).   [**Name2 (NI) 6**] LE edema and is on
   chronic Lasix at home (check LENIs in am). Lasix currently on hold.
   ECG from [**2169-1-2**] to [**2169-1-3**] demonstrate a change in axis and
   co-incides with chills/rigors/shortness of breath noted in one of the
   consultant notes.  ECG here with new TWI V1-V4 and maintenance of new
   axis since [**1-2**]. Patient is ruled out for MI by troponins. Continue
   aspirin and statin.  Unclear why not on ace or beta blocker at home
   given history of CAD/CHF.
   - Follow-up AM EKG
   - Follow-up ECHO
   5. Lower Extremity Edema:
   Right greater than left with no associated pain.
   - Lower extremity dopplers to evaluate for DVTs.
   5. Parkinson's disease:
   Continue Sinemet and Pramipexole at outpatient doses.
   6. Diabetes mellitus, type 2:
   SSI for now
   7. Hyperlipidemia:
   Continue Zocor
   8. Allergies:
   Continue outpatient Singulair, albuterol nebs prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female admitted to the ICU with sepsis, likely due to a biliary source, and polymicrobial bacteremia. She has a history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia, and cholangitis. She is currently on linezolid, meropenem, and gentamicin, with gentamicin dosed based on trough levels. She has a low urine output, with an average of 28 mL/hr, despite increasing fluid rates. Her blood culture from yesterday showed growth of GPC in pairs and chains. She has no pain or dyspnea but reports a sore bum.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.4°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, and blood pressure of 144/59 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 98%. She has bilateral 2+ pitting edema of her lower extremities and multiple injuries to her anterior tibias bilaterally.

Lab results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 25.6 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 104 K/uL. Her troponin level is 0.05 ng/mL, indicating myocardial infarction, and her creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, leukocytosis, and altered mental status. The plan is to continue linezolid, meropenem, and gentamicin, with gentamicin dosed based on trough levels. She will undergo ERCP for evaluation of stents and CT abdomen to further investigate intra-abdominal processes. She will also receive digoxin to optimize electrolytes and continue statin therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing septic shock, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Myocardial Infarction: The patient's troponin level is elevated, indicating myocardial infarction, which can lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which can lead to cardiac complications such as stroke, cardiac arrest, and heart failure.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which can lead to bleeding complications such as petechiae, ecchymoses, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Liver Abscess: The patient's blood culture shows growth of GPC in pairs and chains, which can indicate a liver abscess.
6. DVT: The patient has bilateral 2+ pitting edema of her lower extremities, which can indicate deep vein thrombosis.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of chronic lung disease and is at risk of developing respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple abscesses in the liver
   adjacent to where the stents are placed in the anterior portion of the
   left lobe.  The largest collection is 1.5 cm; additionally there are a
   couple of subcm foci.  Also seen is intrahepatic ductal
   dilation/cholangitis.  The radiologist also suspects a mass centrally
   at the porta hepatis as intrahepatic ductal dilation is present (but no
   mass is visualized).  Per radiology none of the collections would be
   amenable to drainage.
   - The patient went for ERCP and had both sides of her stents flushed
   without complication.
   - Culture data was faxed from the OSH and showed:
      - enterococcus sensitive to gent and streptomycin
      - E.coli sensitive to gent, imipenem, and cephalosporins
      - Klebsiella pansensitive except to amp
   - The lower extrem dopplers showed a DVT in her left leg (even though
   the right leg looks more swollen).  After her ERCP she was started on a
   heparin gtt for a goal PTT of 50-70.
   - Her TTE showed an EF of >55%, but elevated PCWP.
   - Her BCx from [**1-5**] were [**4-8**] gram + cocci in pairs and chains
   - There was concern that the patient aspirated her pm meds so her meds
   were changed to IV and speech and swallow c/s was requested.
   This am she denies pain, SOB, or other complaints.

   CT abd/pelvis [**12-7**] -
   1. Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with peri-biliary enhancement
   consistent with cholangitis. Anteriorly in the left lobe, multiple
   hypodense collections with enhancing rims, consistent with multiple
   abscesses. The largest measures approximately 2 cm and may be amenable
   to percutaneous sampling if desired, but is not likely amenable to
   catheter drainage at its present size. 2. Vague region of parenchymal
   enhancement at the apex of dilated ducts could represent obstructive
   tumor mass, but its margins are difficult to define.
   3. Interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, and small amount of ascites.
   4. Interval increase in size of enhancing pericardial lymph node.
   5. Evidence of thrombosis of the posterior right portal vein, resulting
   in heterogeneous perfusion of the posterior right lobe of the liver.
   6. 9-mm pancreatic hypodensity, not previously visualized. While it is
   too small to characterize, findings suggest a cystic lesion such as a
   dilated side branch or an isolated cystic lesion. If desired, this can
   be further evaluated with MRCP.
   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old female with history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial
   bacteremia from cholangitis presenting with sepsis, now improving s/p
   ERCP, also with a lower extremity DVT now on heparin.
   # Sepsis/leukocytosis/Cholangitis:
   At the OSH she was hypotensive with leukocytosis and polymicrobial
   bacteremia. Currently with E. coli, Klebsiella, GPC and VRE from blood
   cultures. Has negative UA/Urine culture and CXR for pneumonia. Source
   is likely biliary, concern for liver abscess on CT scan from [**2169-1-3**]
   from OSH.  She was started on meropenem, linezolid, and gent for her
   polymicrobial bacteremia.  Inital blood cultures here have grown out
   [**4-8**] GPC in pairs and chains.  Culture data was faxed from the OSH and
   showed: 1) enterococcus sensitive to gent and streptomycin, 2) E.coli
   sensitive to gent, imipenem, and cephalosporins, and 3) Klebsiella
   pansensitive except to amp.  The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple
   abscesses in the liver adjacent to where the stents are placed in the
   anterior portion of the left lobe.  The largest collection is 1.5-2 cm;
   additionally there are a couple of subcm foci.  Also seen is
   intrahepatic ductal dilation/cholangitis.  The radiologist also
   suspects a mass centrally at the porta hepatis as intrahepatic ductal
   dilation is present (but no mass is visualized).  Per radiology none of
   the collections would be amenable to drainage.  She underwent ERCP on
   [**1-6**] and had both sides of her stents flushed without complication.
   - Continue Linezolid, Meropenem, Gentamicin with gent dosed Q48H with a
   trough prior to each dose.  The OSH sensitivity data showed that some
   of the organisms were resistent, however this combination of
   antibiotics adequately covers them all.
   - F/U pending Bcx
   - Wean antibiotics as indicated by culture data
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   - As the liver abscesses are not amenable to drainage, she will need a
   prolonged course of antibiotics for treatment.  Givent the concern for
   a mass at the porta hepatis and the patient
s known history of
   cholangiocarcinoma, she may need to undergo further imaging for this
   mass.
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, currently
   in sinus with PACs. Digoxin level returned two days again at 3.5 and
   her dig was held ysterday.
   - Will restart digoxin again today with a lower dose of 0.0625 mg every
   other day (she was on 0.125 mg daily).
   - As the patient has many complicating medical issues and has a history
   of falls, even with her CHADS score of 4, she would not be a great
   candidate for anticoagulation.
   # Hypertension: The patient
s SBPs have been trending upwards.  She
   usually is on lasix 40 mg daily at home.
   - Can restart her home lasix.
   # Lower Extremity Edema/ Left leg DVT:
   Right greater than left edema with no associated pain.  Lower extremity
   doppler showed a left-sided DVT.  The patient was started on a heparin
   gtt overnight.
   - Continue anticoagulation with the heparin drip for treatment of her
   DVT with a goal of 50-70.  Will need to have discussion with family
   about goals of care to determine whether she should continue to be
   anticoagulated for the DVT vs IVC filter vs no treatment given her risk
   of bleeding due to her history of falls.
   - Restart home lasix as above.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   No evidence of splenomegaly on CT scan. Admission Plt count 243 and now
   104 (OSH value was 93).  Stable
   # Possible NSTEMI:
   Positive troponin, ECG changes and elevated BNP at OSH (though clinical
   setting in which this was ordered is unclear).   [**Name2 (NI) 6**] LE edema and is on
   chronic Lasix at home. Lasix currently on hold.  ECG from [**2169-1-2**] to
   [**2169-1-3**] demonstrates a change in axis and co-incides with
   chills/rigors/shortness of breath noted in one of the consultant
   notes.  ECG here with new TWI V1-V4 and maintenance of new axis since
   [**1-2**]. Patient is ruled out for MI by troponins.  Her TTE yesterday
   showed a normal EF >55%, however increased PCWP indicating diastolic
   heart failure.
   - Continue aspirin and statin.  Unclear why not on ace or beta blocker
   at home given history of CAD/CHF.  Will hold off starting either in the
   acute setting of resolving bacteremia.
   # Parkinson's disease:
   - Continue Sinemet and Pramipexole at outpatient doses.
   # Diabetes mellitus, type 2: Well controlled, not requiring coverage,
   although she has been NPO.
   - qid fingersticks and SSI coverage.
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Zocor
   # Allergies:
   - Continue outpatient Singulair, albuterol nebs prn

   Nutrition: NPO for now until speech and swallow evaluates her given
   aspiration concerns.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple abscesses in the liver
   adjacent to where the stents are placed in the anterior portion of the
   left lobe.  The largest collection is 1.5 cm; additionally there are a
   couple of subcm foci.  Also seen is intrahepatic ductal
   dilation/cholangitis.  The radiologist also suspects a mass centrally
   at the porta hepatis as intrahepatic ductal dilation is present (but no
   mass is visualized).  Per radiology none of the collections would be
   amenable to drainage.
   - The patient went for ERCP and had both sides of her stents flushed
   without complication.
   - Culture data was faxed from the OSH and showed:
      - enterococcus sensitive to gent and streptomycin
      - E.coli sensitive to gent, imipenem, and cephalosporins
      - Klebsiella pansensitive except to amp
   - The lower extrem dopplers showed a DVT in her left leg (even though
   the right leg looks more swollen).  After her ERCP she was started on a
   heparin gtt for a goal PTT of 50-70.
   - Her TTE showed an EF of >55%, but elevated PCWP.
   - Her BCx from [**1-5**] were [**4-8**] gram + cocci in pairs and chains
   - There was concern that the patient aspirated her pm meds so her meds
   were changed to IV and speech and swallow c/s was requested.
   This am she denies pain, SOB, or other complaints.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia, and cholangitis. She presented with sepsis, leukocytosis, and polymicrobial bacteremia. The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple abscesses in the liver adjacent to where the stents are placed in the anterior portion of the left lobe, with the largest collection measuring approximately 1.5-2 cm. The patient underwent ERCP and had both sides of her stents flushed without complication. She is currently on a prolonged course of antibiotics for treatment of the liver abscesses, and further imaging is needed to evaluate a suspected mass at the porta hepatis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's polymicrobial bacteremia and liver abscesses increase her risk of developing sepsis.
2. Cholangitis: The patient's intrahepatic ductal dilation and cholangitis may lead to further complications, such as biliary obstruction or pancreatitis.
3. Liver Abscesses: The patient's liver abscesses may rupture or become infected, leading to further complications.
4. DVT: The patient's left leg DVT increases her risk of developing pulmonary embolism or further complications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase her risk of bleeding, especially if she requires further surgical or medical interventions.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may increase her risk of developing stroke or further cardiac complications.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may increase her risk of developing cardiac complications or further cardiovascular events.
8. NSTEMI: The patient's positive troponin and ECG changes may indicate a possible NSTEMI, which could lead to further cardiac complications.
9. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes mellitus may lead to further complications, such as hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, especially if her blood sugar levels are not well-controlled.
10. Parkinson's Disease: The patient's Parkinson's disease may lead to further complications, such as falls or difficulty with oral intake, especially if her medications are not well-controlled.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics for treatment of polymicrobial bacteremia and liver abscesses.
2. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and blood cultures to ensure that the antibiotics are effective.
3. Consider further imaging to evaluate the suspected mass at the porta hepatis.
4. Continue anticoagulation with heparin for treatment of the left leg DVT.
5. Monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and platelet count to ensure that it does not worsen.
6. Continue medications for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and Parkinson's disease.
7. Monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and adjust her medications as needed to ensure that her diabetes mellitus is well-controlled.
8. Consider further cardiac evaluation to rule out NSTEMI or other cardiac complications.
9. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust her diet as needed to ensure that she is receiving adequate nutrition.
10. Consider further interventions, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or surgical drainage, to treat the liver abscesses and cholangitis."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple abscesses in the liver
   adjacent to where the stents are placed in the anterior portion of the
   left lobe.  The largest collection is 1.5 cm; additionally there are a
   couple of subcm foci.  Also seen is intrahepatic ductal
   dilation/cholangitis.  The radiologist also suspects a mass centrally
   at the porta hepatis as intrahepatic ductal dilation is present (but no
   mass is visualized).  Per radiology none of the collections would be
   amenable to drainage.
   - The patient went for ERCP and had both sides of her stents flushed
   without complication.
   - Culture data was faxed from the OSH and showed:
      - enterococcus sensitive to gent and streptomycin
      - E.coli sensitive to gent, imipenem, and cephalosporins
      - Klebsiella pansensitive except to amp
   - The lower extrem dopplers showed a DVT in her left leg (even though
   the right leg looks more swollen).  After her ERCP she was started on a
   heparin gtt for a goal PTT of 50-70.
   - Her TTE showed an EF of >55%, but elevated PCWP.
   - Her BCx from [**1-5**] were [**4-8**] gram + cocci in pairs and chains
   - There was concern that the patient aspirated her pm meds so her meds
   were changed to IV and speech and swallow c/s was requested.

   CT abd/pelvis [**1-6**]:
   CT abd/pelvis [**12-7**] -
   1. Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with peri-biliary enhancement
   consistent with cholangitis. Anteriorly in the left lobe, multiple
   hypodense collections with enhancing rims, consistent with multiple
   abscesses. The largest measures approximately 2 cm and may be amenable
   to percutaneous sampling if desired, but is not likely amenable to
   catheter drainage at its present size.
   2. Vague region of parenchymal enhancement at the apex of dilated ducts
   could represent obstructive tumor mass, but its margins are difficult
   to define.
   3. Interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, and small amount of ascites.
   4. Interval increase in size of enhancing pericardial lymph node.
   5. Evidence of thrombosis of the posterior right portal vein, resulting
   in heterogeneous perfusion of the posterior right lobe of the liver.
   6. 9-mm pancreatic hypodensity, not previously visualized. While it is
   too small to characterize, findings suggest a cystic lesion such as a
   dilated side branch or an isolated cystic lesion. If desired, this can
   be further evaluated with MRCP.
   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old female with history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial
   bacteremia from cholangitis presenting with sepsis, now improving s/p
   ERCP, also with a lower extremity DVT now on heparin.
   # Sepsis/leukocytosis/Cholangitis:
   At the OSH she was hypotensive with leukocytosis and polymicrobial
   bacteremia. Currently with E. coli, Klebsiella, GPC and VRE from blood
   cultures. Has negative UA/Urine culture and CXR for pneumonia. Source
   is likely biliary, concern for liver abscess on CT scan from [**2169-1-3**]
   from OSH.  She was started on meropenem, linezolid, and gent for her
   polymicrobial bacteremia.  Inital blood cultures here have grown out
   [**4-8**] GPC in pairs and chains.  Culture data was faxed from the OSH and
   showed: 1) enterococcus sensitive to gent and streptomycin, 2) E.coli
   sensitive to gent, imipenem, and cephalosporins, and 3) Klebsiella
   pansensitive except to amp.  The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple
   abscesses in the liver adjacent to where the stents are placed in the
   anterior portion of the left lobe.  The largest collection is 1.5 cm;
   additionally there are a couple of subcm foci.  Also seen is
   intrahepatic ductal dilation/cholangitis.  The radiologist also
   suspects a mass centrally at the porta hepatis as intrahepatic ductal
   dilation is present (but no mass is visualized).  Per radiology none of
   the collections would be amenable to drainage.  She underwent ERCP on
   [**1-6**] and had both sides of her stents flushed without complication.
   - Continue Linezolid, Meropenem, Gentamicin with gent dosed Q48H with a
   trough prior to each dose.  The OSH sensitivity data showed that some
   of the organisms were resistent, however this combination of
   antibiotics adequately covers them all.
   - F/U pending Bcx
   - Wean antibiotics as indicated by culture data
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, currently
   in sinus with PACs. Digoxin level returned two days again at 3.5 and
   her dig was held ysterday.
   - Will restart digoxin again today with a lower dose of 0.0625 mg daily
   (she was on 0.125 mg daily).
   - As the patient has many complicating medical issues and has a history
   of falls, even with her CHADS score of 4, she would not be a great
   candidate for anticoagulation.
   # Lower Extremity Edema/ Left leg DVT:
   Right greater than left edema with no associated pain.  Lower extremity
   doppler showed a left-sided DVT.  The patient was started on a heparin
   gtt overnight.
   - Continue anticoagulation with the heparin drip for treatment of her
   DVT with a goal of 50-70.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   No evidence of splenomegaly on CT scan. Admission Plt count 243 and now
   *** (OSH value was 93).  Part of her platelet drop was likely from
   dilution.
   # Possible NSTEMI:
   Positive troponin, ECG changes and elevated BNP at OSH (though clinical
   setting in which this was ordered is unclear).   [**Name2 (NI) 6**] LE edema and is on
   chronic Lasix at home. Lasix currently on hold.  ECG from [**2169-1-2**] to
   [**2169-1-3**] demonstrates a change in axis and co-incides with
   chills/rigors/shortness of breath noted in one of the consultant
   notes.  ECG here with new TWI V1-V4 and maintenance of new axis since
   [**1-2**]. Patient is ruled out for MI by troponins.  Her TTE yesterday
   showed a normal EF >55%, however increased PCWP indicating diastolic
   heart failure.
   - Continue aspirin and statin.  Unclear why not on ace or beta blocker
   at home given history of CAD/CHF.
   - Follow-up AM EKG
   # Parkinson's disease:
   - Continue Sinemet and Pramipexole at outpatient doses.
   # Diabetes mellitus, type 2: Well controlled, not requiring coverage,
   although she has been NPO.
   - qid fingersticks and SSI coverage.
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Zocor
   # Allergies:
   - Continue outpatient Singulair, albuterol nebs prn
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now until speech and swallow evaluates her given
   aspiration concerns.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   CT abd/pelvis [**1-6**]:
   CT abd/pelvis [**12-7**] -
   1. Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with peri-biliary enhancement
   consistent with cholangitis. Anteriorly in the left lobe, multiple
   hypodense collections with enhancing rims, consistent with multiple
   abscesses. The largest measures approximately 2 cm and may be amenable
   to percutaneous sampling if desired, but is not likely amenable to
   catheter drainage at its present size.
   2. Vague region of parenchymal enhancement at the apex of dilated ducts
   could represent obstructive tumor mass, but its margins are difficult
   to define.
   3. Interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, and small amount of ascites.
   4. Interval increase in size of enhancing pericardial lymph node.
   5. Evidence of thrombosis of the posterior right portal vein, resulting
   in heterogeneous perfusion of the posterior right lobe of the liver.
   6. 9-mm pancreatic hypodensity, not previously visualized. While it is
   too small to characterize, findings suggest a cystic lesion such as a
   dilated side branch or an isolated cystic lesion. If desired, this can
   be further evaluated with MRCP.
   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old female with history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial
   bacteremia from cholangitis presenting with sepsis, now improving s/p
   ERCP, also with a lower extremity DVT now on heparin.
   # Sepsis/leukocytosis/Cholangitis:
   At the OSH she was hypotensive with leukocytosis and polymicrobial
   bacteremia. Currently with E. coli, Klebsiella, GPC and VRE from blood
   cultures. Has negative UA/Urine culture and CXR for pneumonia. Source
   is likely biliary, concern for liver abscess on CT scan from [**2169-1-3**]
   from OSH.  She was started on meropenem, linezolid, and gent for her
   polymicrobial bacteremia.  Inital blood cultures here have grown out
   [**4-8**] GPC in pairs and chains.  Culture data was faxed from the OSH and
   showed: 1) enterococcus sensitive to gent and streptomycin, 2) E.coli
   sensitive to gent, imipenem, and cephalosporins, and 3) Klebsiella
   pansensitive except to amp.  The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple
   abscesses in the liver adjacent to where the stents are placed in the
   anterior portion of the left lobe.  The largest collection is 1.5 cm;
   additionally there are a couple of subcm foci.  Also seen is
   intrahepatic ductal dilation/cholangitis.  The radiologist also
   suspects a mass centrally at the porta hepatis as intrahepatic ductal
   dilation is present (but no mass is visualized).  Per radiology none of
   the collections would be amenable to drainage.  She underwent ERCP on
   [**1-6**] and had both sides of her stents flushed without complication.
   - Continue Linezolid, Meropenem, Gentamicin with gent dosed Q48H with a
   trough prior to each dose.  The OSH sensitivity data showed that some
   of the organisms were resistent, however this combination of
   antibiotics adequately covers them all.
   - F/U pending Bcx
   - Wean antibiotics as indicated by culture data
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, currently
   in sinus with PACs. Digoxin level returned two days again at 3.5 and
   her dig was held ysterday.
   - Will restart digoxin again today with a lower dose of 0.0625 mg daily
   (she was on 0.125 mg daily).
   - As the patient has many complicating medical issues and has a history
   of falls, even with her CHADS score of 4, she would not be a great
   candidate for anticoagulation.
   # Lower Extremity Edema/ Left leg DVT:
   Right greater than left edema with no associated pain.  Lower extremity
   doppler showed a left-sided DVT.  The patient was started on a heparin
   gtt overnight.
   - Continue anticoagulation with the heparin drip for treatment of her
   DVT with a goal of 50-70.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   No evidence of splenomegaly on CT scan. Admission Plt count 243 and now
   *** (OSH value was 93).  Part of her platelet drop was likely from
   dilution.
   # Possible NSTEMI:
   Positive troponin, ECG changes and elevated BNP at OSH (though clinical
   setting in which this was ordered is unclear).   [**Name2 (NI) 6**] LE edema and is on
   chronic Lasix at home. Lasix currently on hold.  ECG from [**2169-1-2**] to
   [**2169-1-3**] demonstrates a change in axis and co-incides with
   chills/rigors/shortness of breath noted in one of the consultant
   notes.  ECG here with new TWI V1-V4 and maintenance of new axis since
   [**1-2**]. Patient is ruled out for MI by troponins.  Her TTE yesterday
   showed a normal EF >55%, however increased PCWP indicating diastolic
   heart failure.
   - Continue aspirin and statin.  Unclear why not on ace or beta blocker
   at home given history of CAD/CHF.
   - Follow-up AM EKG
   # Parkinson's disease:
   - Continue Sinemet and Pramipexole at outpatient doses.
   # Diabetes mellitus, type 2: Well controlled, not requiring coverage,
   although she has been NPO.
   - qid fingersticks and SSI coverage.
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Zocor
   # Allergies:
   - Continue outpatient Singulair, albuterol nebs prn
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now until speech and swallow evaluates her given
   aspiration concerns.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia, and sepsis. She has undergone ERCP and had both sides of her stents flushed without complication. The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Liver abscesses: The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple abscesses in the liver adjacent to where the stents are placed in the anterior portion of the left lobe. The largest collection is 1.5 cm, and there are a couple of subcm foci. The radiologist suspects a mass centrally at the porta hepatis, but no mass is visualized.
2. Cholangitis: The patient has intrahepatic ductal dilation and cholangitis, which is likely the source of her polymicrobial bacteremia.
3. Lower extremity DVT: The patient has a left-sided DVT, and she is on heparin therapy with a goal PTT of 50-70.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 104 K/uL, which is lower than her admission platelet count of 243. Part of her platelet drop is likely due to dilution.
5. Possible NSTEMI: The patient has a positive troponin, ECG changes, and elevated BNP, which suggests possible diastolic heart failure. However, she is ruled out for MI by troponins.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and she is currently in sinus rhythm with PACs.
7. Parkinson's disease: The patient is taking Sinemet and Pramipexole for her Parkinson's disease.
8. Diabetes mellitus, type 2: The patient has well-controlled diabetes, but she is NPO at present.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is taking Zocor for her hyperlipidemia.

The patient is being treated with a combination of antibiotics, including linezolid, meropenem, and gentamicin, to cover her polymicrobial bacteremia. She is also receiving heparin therapy for her DVT and is being monitored for possible bleeding complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her polymicrobial bacteremia and liver abscesses.
2. Liver failure: The patient's liver abscesses and cholangitis can lead to liver failure if not properly treated.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's DVT can lead to pulmonary embolism if not properly treated.
4. Heart failure: The patient's possible NSTEMI and diastolic heart failure can lead to heart failure if not properly treated.
5. Kidney failure: The patient's bacteremia and sepsis can lead to kidney failure if not properly treated.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and sepsis can lead to respiratory failure if not properly treated.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's heart function and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory function and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Consider consulting a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist or a cardiologist, to further evaluate and manage the patient's condition."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple abscesses in the liver
   adjacent to where the stents are placed in the anterior portion of the
   left lobe.  The largest collection is 1.5 cm; additionally there are a
   couple of subcm foci.  Also seen is intrahepatic ductal
   dilation/cholangitis.  The radiologist also suspects a mass centrally
   at the porta hepatis as intrahepatic ductal dilation is present (but no
   mass is visualized).  Per radiology none of the collections would be
   amenable to drainage.
   - The patient went for ERCP and had both sides of her stents flushed
   without complication.
   - Culture data was faxed from the OSH and showed:
      - enterococcus sensitive to gent and streptomycin
      - E.coli sensitive to gent, imipenem, and cephalosporins
      - Klebsiella pansensitive except to amp
   - The lower extrem dopplers showed a DVT in her left leg (even though
   the right leg looks more swollen).  After her ERCP she was started on a
   heparin gtt for a goal PTT of 50-70.
   - Her TTE showed an EF of >55%, but elevated PCWP.
   - Her BCx from [**1-5**] were [**4-8**] gram + cocci in pairs and chains
   - There was concern that the patient aspirated her pm meds so her meds
   were changed to IV and speech and swallow c/s was requested.

   prolonged course of antibiotics for treatment.  Givent the concern for
   a mass at the porta hepatis and the patient
s known history of
   cholangiocarcinoma, she may need to undergo further imaging for this
   mass.
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, currently
   in sinus with PACs. Digoxin level returned two days again at 3.5 and
   her dig was held ysterday.
   - Will restart digoxin again today with a lower dose of 0.0625 mg daily
   (she was on 0.125 mg daily).
   - As the patient has many complicating medical issues and has a history
   of falls, even with her CHADS score of 4, she would not be a great
   candidate for anticoagulation.
   # Hypertension: The patient
s SBPs have been trending upwards.  She
   usually is on lasix 40 mg daily at home.
   - Can restart her home lasix.
   # Lower Extremity Edema/ Left leg DVT:
   Right greater than left edema with no associated pain.  Lower extremity
   doppler showed a left-sided DVT.  The patient was started on a heparin
   gtt overnight.
   - Continue anticoagulation with the heparin drip for treatment of her
   DVT with a goal of 50-70.
   - Restart home lasix as above.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   No evidence of splenomegaly on CT scan. Admission Plt count 243 and now
   *** (OSH value was 93).  Part of her platelet drop was likely from
   dilution.
   # Possible NSTEMI:
   Positive troponin, ECG changes and elevated BNP at OSH (though clinical
   setting in which this was ordered is unclear).   [**Name2 (NI) 6**] LE edema and is on
   chronic Lasix at home. Lasix currently on hold.  ECG from [**2169-1-2**] to
   [**2169-1-3**] demonstrates a change in axis and co-incides with
   chills/rigors/shortness of breath noted in one of the consultant
   notes.  ECG here with new TWI V1-V4 and maintenance of new axis since
   [**1-2**]. Patient is ruled out for MI by troponins.  Her TTE yesterday
   showed a normal EF >55%, however increased PCWP indicating diastolic
   heart failure.
   - Continue aspirin and statin.  Unclear why not on ace or beta blocker
   at home given history of CAD/CHF.
   - Follow-up AM EKG

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple abscesses in the liver
   adjacent to where the stents are placed in the anterior portion of the
   left lobe.  The largest collection is 1.5 cm; additionally there are a
   couple of subcm foci.  Also seen is intrahepatic ductal
   dilation/cholangitis.  The radiologist also suspects a mass centrally
   at the porta hepatis as intrahepatic ductal dilation is present (but no
   mass is visualized).  Per radiology none of the collections would be
   amenable to drainage.
   - The patient went for ERCP and had both sides of her stents flushed
   without complication.
   - Culture data was faxed from the OSH and showed:
      - enterococcus sensitive to gent and streptomycin
      - E.coli sensitive to gent, imipenem, and cephalosporins
      - Klebsiella pansensitive except to amp
   - The lower extrem dopplers showed a DVT in her left leg (even though
   the right leg looks more swollen).  After her ERCP she was started on a
   heparin gtt for a goal PTT of 50-70.
   - Her TTE showed an EF of >55%, but elevated PCWP.
   - Her BCx from [**1-5**] were [**4-8**] gram + cocci in pairs and chains
   - There was concern that the patient aspirated her pm meds so her meds
   were changed to IV and speech and swallow c/s was requested.

   CT abd/pelvis [**1-6**]:
   CT abd/pelvis [**12-7**] -
   1. Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with peri-biliary enhancement
   consistent with cholangitis. Anteriorly in the left lobe, multiple
   hypodense collections with enhancing rims, consistent with multiple
   abscesses. The largest measures approximately 2 cm and may be amenable
   to percutaneous sampling if desired, but is not likely amenable to
   catheter drainage at its present size. 2. Vague region of parenchymal
   enhancement at the apex of dilated ducts could represent obstructive
   tumor mass, but its margins are difficult to define.
   3. Interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, and small amount of ascites.
   4. Interval increase in size of enhancing pericardial lymph node.
   5. Evidence of thrombosis of the posterior right portal vein, resulting
   in heterogeneous perfusion of the posterior right lobe of the liver.
   6. 9-mm pancreatic hypodensity, not previously visualized. While it is
   too small to characterize, findings suggest a cystic lesion such as a
   dilated side branch or an isolated cystic lesion. If desired, this can
   be further evaluated with MRCP.
   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old female with history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial
   bacteremia from cholangitis presenting with sepsis, now improving s/p
   ERCP, also with a lower extremity DVT now on heparin.
   # Sepsis/leukocytosis/Cholangitis:
   At the OSH she was hypotensive with leukocytosis and polymicrobial
   bacteremia. Currently with E. coli, Klebsiella, GPC and VRE from blood
   cultures. Has negative UA/Urine culture and CXR for pneumonia. Source
   is likely biliary, concern for liver abscess on CT scan from [**2169-1-3**]
   from OSH.  She was started on meropenem, linezolid, and gent for her
   polymicrobial bacteremia.  Inital blood cultures here have grown out
   [**4-8**] GPC in pairs and chains.  Culture data was faxed from the OSH and
   showed: 1) enterococcus sensitive to gent and streptomycin, 2) E.coli
   sensitive to gent, imipenem, and cephalosporins, and 3) Klebsiella
   pansensitive except to amp.  The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple
   abscesses in the liver adjacent to where the stents are placed in the
   anterior portion of the left lobe.  The largest collection is 1.5 cm;
   additionally there are a couple of subcm foci.  Also seen is
   intrahepatic ductal dilation/cholangitis.  The radiologist also
   suspects a mass centrally at the porta hepatis as intrahepatic ductal
   dilation is present (but no mass is visualized).  Per radiology none of
   the collections would be amenable to drainage.  She underwent ERCP on
   [**1-6**] and had both sides of her stents flushed without complication.
   - Continue Linezolid, Meropenem, Gentamicin with gent dosed Q48H with a
   trough prior to each dose.  The OSH sensitivity data showed that some
   of the organisms were resistent, however this combination of
   antibiotics adequately covers them all.
   - F/U pending Bcx
   - Wean antibiotics as indicated by culture data
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   - As the liver abscesses are not amenable to drainage, she will need a
   prolonged course of antibiotics for treatment.  Givent the concern for
   a mass at the porta hepatis and the patient
s known history of
   cholangiocarcinoma, she may need to undergo further imaging for this
   mass.
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, currently
   in sinus with PACs. Digoxin level returned two days again at 3.5 and
   her dig was held ysterday.
   - Will restart digoxin again today with a lower dose of 0.0625 mg daily
   (she was on 0.125 mg daily).
   - As the patient has many complicating medical issues and has a history
   of falls, even with her CHADS score of 4, she would not be a great
   candidate for anticoagulation.
   # Hypertension: The patient
s SBPs have been trending upwards.  She
   usually is on lasix 40 mg daily at home.
   - Can restart her home lasix.

   - Continue anticoagulation with the heparin drip for treatment of her
   DVT with a goal of 50-70.
   - Restart home lasix as above.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   No evidence of splenomegaly on CT scan. Admission Plt count 243 and now
   *** (OSH value was 93).  Part of her platelet drop was likely from
   dilution.
   # Possible NSTEMI:
   Positive troponin, ECG changes and elevated BNP at OSH (though clinical
   setting in which this was ordered is unclear).   [**Name2 (NI) 6**] LE edema and is on
   chronic Lasix at home. Lasix currently on hold.  ECG from [**2169-1-2**] to

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia, and cholangitis. She was admitted to the ICU with sepsis, leukocytosis, and polymicrobial bacteremia. The patient has undergone ERCP and had both sides of her stents flushed without complication. The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple abscesses in the liver adjacent to where the stents are placed, with the largest collection measuring 1.5 cm. The patient has also been diagnosed with a lower extremity DVT, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and possible NSTEMI.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis and Organ Failure: The patient's polymicrobial bacteremia and liver abscesses may lead to sepsis and organ failure, particularly in the liver and kidneys.
2. Liver Abscesses: The patient's liver abscesses are not amenable to drainage, and she will require a prolonged course of antibiotics to treat the infection.
3. DVT and Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's lower extremity DVT may lead to pulmonary embolism, which can be life-threatening.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, and thromboembolism.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to complications such as heart failure, stroke, and kidney damage.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding complications, particularly in the context of invasive procedures.
7. Possible NSTEMI: The patient's positive troponin and ECG changes may indicate a possible NSTEMI, which can lead to complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and death.
8. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's type 2 diabetes may lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, particularly if she is not receiving adequate insulin therapy.
9. Respiratory Failure: The patient's pneumonia and respiratory failure may lead to complications such as respiratory arrest and death.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple comorbidities, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage potential complications."

   LIVER LESIONS -- likely represent abscesses, but may also represent
   tumor.  Continue antimicrobials.  Monitor lesions with f/u study in
   future.
   CHOLANGITIS -- s/p ERCP and flushing of metal stents.  Tolerated well.
   Continue antimicrials
   DVT -- lift LE.  Heparin with goal PTT 60-80.  Monitor LE girth.  Need
   to determine long-term goals as patient may not be good candidate for
   chronic anticoagulation --> IVC filter may be option if no plans for
   coumadin.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- confusion attibuted to sepsis.  Now improved.
   CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA -- palliative care.
   PORTA HEPATIS MASS -- suggests new mass, perhaps progression of known
   cholangiocarcinoma.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- hold, and resume Digoxin dosing when level declines
   to therapeutic range.
   PARKINSON's DISEASE -- continue usual meds.  Neurology to assist in
   medication management.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending swallow evaluation.  Likely
   attributed to Parkinson's.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has undergone ERCP and ultrasonography, which revealed a left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is receiving heparin infusions and has a goal partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 60-80 seconds.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 73 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 160/62 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 100%.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a soft and non-tender abdomen, as well as the presence of a porta hepatis mass. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and alkaline phosphatase levels, consistent with sepsis. The patient's coagulation studies show a prolonged PT and PTT, indicating a bleeding diathesis.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Bacteremia: polymicrobial, high-grade, in the context of new liver lesions (presumed abscesses).
* Liver lesions: likely represent abscesses, but may also represent tumor. Continue antimicrobials and monitor lesions with future studies.
* Cholangitis: s/p ERCP and flushing of metal stents. Tolerated well. Continue antimicrobials.
* DVT: lift LE. Heparin with goal PTT 60-80. Monitor LE girth. Consider IVC filter if no plans for coumadin.
* Altered mental status: attributed to sepsis. Now improved.
* Cholangiocarcinoma: palliative care.
* Porta hepatis mass: suggests new mass, perhaps progression of known cholangiocarcinoma.
* Digoxin toxicity: hold, and resume Digoxin dosing when level declines to therapeutic range.
* Parkinson's disease: continue usual meds. Neurology to assist in medication management.
* Nutritional support: NPO pending swallow evaluation. Likely attributed to Parkinson's.
* Fluids: replete. Monitor I/O. Maintain balance.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction or failure (e.g., acute kidney injury, respiratory failure)
* Liver abscess or tumor progression
* Cholangitis or pancreatitis
* Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
* Parkinson's disease-related complications (e.g., falls, dysphagia)
* Digoxin toxicity or overdose
* Fluid and electrolyte imbalances
* Nutritional deficiencies or malnutrition
* ICU-acquired infections (e.g., ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-associated bloodstream infection)

Given the patient's critical illness and complex medical conditions, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   BACTEREMIA -- polymicrobial, high grade, in context of new liver
   lesions (presumed abscesses).
   LIVER LESIONS -- likely represent abscesses, but may also represent
   tumor.
   CHOLANGITIS -- s/p ERCP and flushing of metal stents.
   DVT -- lift LE.  Heparin with goal PTT 60-80.  Monitor LE girth.  Need
   to determine long-term goals as patient may not be good candidate for
   chronic anticoagulation --> IVC filter may be option if no plans for
   coumadin.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- confusion attibuted to sepsis.
   CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA -- palliative care.
   PORTA HEPATIS MASS -- suggests new mass, perhaps progression of known
   cholangiocarcinoma.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- hold, and resume Digoxin dosing when level declines
   to therapeutic range.
   PARKINSON's DISEASE -- continue usual meds.  Neurology to assist in
   medication management.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending swallow evaluation.  Likely
   attributed to Parkinson's.
   FLUIDS -- replete.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high-grade polymicrobial bacteremia, which can lead to septic shock, organ failure, and mortality.
2. Liver abscesses: The patient has liver lesions that may represent abscesses, which can rupture and cause peritonitis, sepsis, or even death.
3. Cholangitis: The patient has cholangitis after ERCP and stent placement, which can lead to sepsis, cholangiocarcinoma, or even death.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a left lower extremity DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism, chronic venous insufficiency, or post-thrombotic syndrome.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status attributed to sepsis, which can lead to delirium, confusion, or even coma.
6. Cholangiocarcinoma: The patient has a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, which is a potentially life-threatening condition.
7. Porta Hepatis Mass: The patient has a new mass in the porta hepatis, which may represent tumor progression or a new lesion.
8. Digoxin Toxicity: The patient has digoxin toxicity, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, bradycardia, or even death.
9. Parkinson's Disease: The patient has Parkinson's disease, which can lead to motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, or even death.
