 KNOWLEDGE DEFICIT
   58 year old woman with remote history of 2 vessel CAD, total occlusion
   of LCx and RCA, presenting with VT / Electrical storm.
   # VT STORM: No clear etiology for persistant ventricular tachycardia /
   fibrillation. Although cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated, this is
   in the setting of repeated defibrillation and in the absence of ECG
   changes. Given known total occlusion of LCx however, ischemic insult to
   scar tissue or new ischemic injury could cause posterior infarct.
   Differential diagnosis for precipitants of VT storm would include
   electrolyte imbalance, new onset heart failure or exacerbation,
   ischemia and drug toxicity / effect. Patient at risk of VT/VF given
   past MI and resulting scar in posterior and infeerior walls.
   -- Continue amiodarone load, pt received 150mg bolus, would continue IV
   load at 1mg/min (60mg/hr) overnight, then reduce to 0.5mg/min (30mg/hr)
   (maximum daily dose 2 gm)
   -- IV Lidocaine with 100mg bolused, continue 2mg drip, monitor mental
   status
   -- Cont low dose Metoprolol to supress ectopy
   -- Trend cardiac enzymes
   -- NPO overnight, will likely need diagnostic cath to rule out active
   ischemia before EP study
   -- EP consult in AM for potential EP study
   -- Continue heparin drip due to stunned myocardium from repeated
   cardioversions
   # CORONARIES:  As above, will need to evaluate for active CAD

Summary:

The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a remote history of 2-vessel CAD, total occlusion of the LCx and RCA, presenting with a ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm. She underwent cardioversion/defibrillation and was converted to a regular rhythm with possible ectopic focus. The patient's mental status is below baseline, and she is receiving amiodarone, lidocaine, and metoprolol infusions. She has a mildly depressed ejection fraction, and regional wall motion abnormality is consistent with previous findings. The patient has a history of mild aortic stenosis and moderate mitral regurgitation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia/Flutter (VT/VF): The patient is at risk of recurrent VT/VF episodes due to her past MI and resulting scar tissue in the posterior and inferior walls.
2. Ischemia: The patient's total occlusion of the LCx and RCA may lead to ischemia or new ischemic injury, which could cause a posterior infarct.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored to prevent imbalance, which could exacerbate the VT/VF episodes.
4. Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's mildly depressed ejection fraction may indicate acute or chronic systolic heart failure, which could worsen if not properly managed.
5. Valvular Disease: The patient's mild aortic stenosis and moderate mitral regurgitation may lead to flash pulmonary edema if not monitored closely.
6. Infection: The patient's indwelling lines and drains increase her risk of infection, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
7. Medication Toxicity: The patient's medication regimen, including amiodarone, lidocaine, and metoprolol, may cause toxicity or interactions, which should be closely monitored.
8. Cardiac Enzyme Elevation: The patient's cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated, which may indicate ongoing myocardial damage or injury.
9. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may indicate hypovolemia or cardiac failure, requiring close monitoring and intervention.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, cardiac enzymes, and electrolyte levels, while also managing her medication regimen and providing supportive care to prevent potential complications."

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a remote history of 2-vessel CAD, total occlusion of the left circumflex (LCx) and right coronary artery (RCA), presenting with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and electrical storm. The patient was cardioverted with 50J and converted to regular rhythm with possible ectopic focus. She was continued on amiodarone and heparin drip, started on lidocaine drip, and low-dose IV and PO metoprolol.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F (36.9°C), heart rate of 55 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 93/46 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 21 inspirations per minute (ipm), and oxygen saturation is 96%. Her physical examination is remarkable for a well-nourished appearance, with no signs of respiratory distress or cardiac failure.

Laboratory results show slightly elevated cardiac enzymes, with a troponin-T level of 0.27 ng/mL, and a creatine kinase (CK) level of 630 IU/L. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) shows bradycardia with a rate in the 50s, one-to-one atrioventricular (A-V) conduction, inverted P-waves in multiple leads suggesting ectopic atrial focus, and hyperacute T-waves in anterolateral leads.

The patient is at risk of VT/VF due to her past myocardial infarction (MI) and resulting scar in the posterior and inferior walls. The differential diagnosis for precipitants of VT storm includes electrolyte imbalance, new-onset heart failure or exacerbation, ischemia, and drug toxicity or effect.

The plan is to continue amiodarone load, IV lidocaine, and low-dose metoprolol to suppress ectopy. The patient will be trended for cardiac enzymes, and a diagnostic catheterization will be performed to rule out active ischemia before an electrophysiology (EP) study. An EP consult has been arranged for the morning to discuss potential EP study.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

1. Ventricular fibrillation (VF): The patient is at risk of VF due to her past MI and resulting scar in the posterior and inferior walls.
2. Heart failure: The patient's mildly depressed ejection fraction (EF) and regional wall motion abnormality suggest the possibility of acute or chronic heart failure.
3. Ischemia: The patient's past MI and total occlusion of the LCx and RCA make her susceptible to ischemic injury, which could worsen her condition.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's use of medications such as amiodarone and lidocaine may lead to electrolyte imbalance, which could exacerbate her condition.
5. Infection: The patient's presence in the ICU increases her risk of developing an infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
6. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications such as heparin and her history of total occlusion of the LCx and RCA make her at risk of bleeding.
7. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of VT and electrical storm makes her susceptible to other arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or flutter.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these complications and improve her clinical outcome."

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health status and potential medical complications:

**Cardiovascular Status:**

* The patient is experiencing ventricular tachycardia (VT) storm, which is resistant to cardioversion.
* She has a remote history of 2-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) with total occlusion of the left circumflex (LCx) and right coronary artery (RCA).
* Cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated, which may indicate muscle damage from repeated cardioversions or a possible ischemic insult to scar tissue or new ischemic injury.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Arrest:** The patient's VT storm is a high-risk condition for cardiac arrest, which could be fatal if not managed promptly and effectively.
2. **Ischemic Injury:** The total occlusion of the LCx and RCA, combined with the patient's VT storm, may increase the risk of ischemic injury to the heart, which could lead to further cardiac complications.
3. **Pulmonary Edema:** The patient's mild aortic stenosis (AS) and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) may increase the risk of flash pulmonary edema during VT episodes, which could lead to respiratory failure.
4. **Sepsis:** The patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of developing sepsis, which could be life-threatening.
5. **Renal Dysfunction:** The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels may indicate renal dysfunction, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
6. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's prolonged fasting and potential electrolyte imbalances may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
7. **Neurological Complications:** The patient's prolonged hospitalization and potential electrolyte imbalances may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

**Plan:**

* Continue amiodarone, lidocaine, and metoprolol to manage the patient's VT storm and potential ectopy.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and troponins to assess for signs of cardiac damage or ischemia.
* Trend the patient's electrolyte levels and glucose levels to prevent further complications.
* Consider starting an ACE inhibitor and long-acting beta blocker after procedures to manage the patient's hypertension and potential cardiac failure.
* Monitor the patient's volume status closely to prevent fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
* Consider repeating the patient's echocardiogram to assess for changes in cardiac function or structure."

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient, a 58-year-old woman, is being treated for ventricular tachycardia (VT) and electrical storm. She has a remote history of 2-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and total occlusion of the left circumflex (LCx) and right coronary artery (RCA). The patient underwent an electrophysiology (EP) study, which revealed chronic occlusion of the RCA and Circ. The EP substrate ablation was performed, and the patient is scheduled for ICD placement tomorrow.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 52 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/51 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy at 2 L via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 96%. Her respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation, and she has a mild decrease in lung function.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated, with a peak CK of 630 IU/L. Her troponin levels are also elevated, suggesting possible muscle damage from defibrillation. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 52 bpm.

The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with the exception of mild edema in the right lower extremity. Her mental status is normal, and she is cooperative and attentive.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes, including a peak CK of 630 IU/L. Her troponin levels are also elevated, suggesting possible muscle damage from defibrillation. Her ECG shows a sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 52 bpm.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Ventricular fibrillation: The patient's VT and electrical storm may lead to ventricular fibrillation, which can be life-threatening.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated cardiac enzymes and troponin levels may indicate possible muscle damage from defibrillation, which can lead to sepsis.
3. Cardiac failure: The patient's mild depression of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) may indicate possible cardiac failure, which can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's mild AS and Mod MR may put her at risk of flash pulmonary edema with VT episodes.
5. Infection: The patient's catheterization and defibrillation may have introduced bacteria into her bloodstream, leading to infection.

Based on the patient's condition, it is recommended to:

1. Continue monitoring her cardiac enzymes and troponin levels to assess for possible muscle damage from defibrillation.
2. Consider starting ACE-I and long-acting beta blockers after procedures to manage her cardiac function.
3. Monitor her volume status closely to prevent pulmonary edema.
4. Consider repeating her echo in the future to assess for possible cardiac failure.
5. Continue to manage her pain, bowel regularity, and heparin therapy as needed."

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a remote history of 2-vessel CAD, total occlusion of LCx and RCA, presenting with VT/electrical storm. She underwent EP substrate ablation and was planned for ICD placement. During the ablation, she became hypoxic and developed angina, which responded to NTG. Her cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated, and she has responded to low-voltage defibrillation. She has mild AS and Mod MR, and is at risk of flash pulmonary edema with VT episodes.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Complications:**
	* Ischemic insult to scar tissue or new ischemic injury could cause posterior infarct.
	* P waves may be present on tele while in wide complex tachycardia.
	* Mildly depressed EF, unclear if this is acute change.
2. **Electrophysiological Complications:**
	* Recurrence of VT/electrical storm despite substrate ablation.
	* Potential for ICD malfunction or inappropriate therapy.
3. **Respiratory Complications:**
	* Risk of flash pulmonary edema with VT episodes.
	* Hypoxia during ablation requiring NRB.
4. **Gastrointestinal Complications:**
	* Risk of bowel regurgitation due to NPO status.
5. **Infectious Complications:**
	* Risk of VAP due to prolonged ICU stay.
	* Risk of DVT due to immobility.
6. **Medication-Related Complications:**
	* Potential for Amiodarone-induced QTC prolongation or thyroid dysfunction.
	* Potential for Metoprolol-induced bradycardia or hypotension.

**Plan:**

1. Continue Amiodarone 0.5 mg/min and switch to 200mg PO daily.
2. D/C lidocaine and heparin gtt.
3. Increase Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID.
4. Trend cardiac enzymes.
5. Plan for ICD placement today.
6. Monitor volume status closely due to risk of flash pulmonary edema.
7. Consider starting ACE-I/long-acting beta blocker after procedures.
8. Repeat echo in the future to assess for potential changes in cardiac function."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient did well yesterday in cath demonstrating non-obstructed LAD and
   no change in anatomy of the CTO LCx and RCA. Then to EP for substrate
   ablation as they were unable to induce VT. Lidocaine weaned off and the
   patient remains on Amio 200 mg Qd with metoprolol 25 mg TID. Patient
   back to EP lab for ICD placement later today. Will plan on discharge
   tomorrow if stable from the arrhythmia point of view.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   -cath with chronic occlusion of RCA and Circ (accessed right groin)\
   -EP performed a substrate ablation.  They were not able to induce
   sustained VT some non-sustained VT that appeared to originate from
   inferior septum and base.  Plan for ICD placement first thing tomorrow.
   -During the ablation the patient became hypoxic requiring NRB for short
   time, now 96% 2L.  Got lasix 40mg IV x1.  Developed angina which
   responded to 1 SL NTG.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 year old woman with remote history of 2 vessel CAD, total occlusion
   of LCx and RCA, presenting with VT / Electrical storm.
   # VT STORM vs SVT (AVNRT w/ abberancy): No clear etiology for
   persistent ventricular tachycardia / fibrillation. Although cardiac
   enzymes are slightly elevated, this is in the setting of repeated
   defibrillation and in the absence of ECG changes. Given known total
   occlusion of LCx however, ischemic insult to scar tissue or new
   ischemic injury could cause posterior infarct.  Also concerned that she
   may have p waves present on tele while in wide complex tachycardia.
   She has also responded to low voltage defibrillation. Cath showed
   chronic occlusion of RCA and Circ. EP substrate ablation
 to return
   for ICD placement this AM. No further episodes of VT overnight.
   -- switch Amiodarone gtt to 200mg PO daily this AM
   -- d/c lidocaine gtt, heparin gtt
   -- increase Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID
   -- Trend cardiac enzymes
 CK peaked at 630
   -- NPO overnight, ICD placement today
   -- EP recs appreciated
   # CORONARIES:  Cath showed occlusion of RCA and Circ, as above.
   -- increase Metoprolol to 25mg PO BID
   -- Aspirin 325mg PO daily
   -- Atorvastatin 80mg PO daily
   #Elevated cardiac enzymes
 CK highly elevated compared to CKMB and
   troponins suggesting muscle damage from debrillation is contributing.
   CK peaked at 630, now downtrending.
   - trend cardiac [**Last Name (un) **]
   # SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE, ACUTE VS CHRONIC:  Mildly depressed EF,
   unclear if this is acute change although regional wall motion
   abnormality is consistent with that from [**2127**]. No symptoms of CHF.
   - Consider starting ACE-I / long acting beta blocker after procedures
   - Recent echo in [**Month (only) 11**] of this year, pending potential findings would
   consider repeating.
   # VALVULAR DISEASE: Mild AS, Mod MR, pt at risk of flash pulmonary
   edema with VT episodes. Pt currently euvolemic.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Patient did well yesterday in cath demonstrating non-obstructed LAD and
   no change in anatomy of the CTO LCx and RCA. Then to EP for substrate
   ablation as they were unable to induce VT. Lidocaine weaned off and the
   patient remains on Amio 200 mg Qd with metoprolol 25 mg TID. Patient
   back to EP lab for ICD placement later today. Will plan on discharge
   tomorrow if stable from the arrhythmia point of view.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2139-1-2**] 05:54 PM ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a remote history of 2-vessel CAD, total occlusion of LCx and RCA, presenting with VT/electrical storm. The patient underwent EP substrate ablation, which was unsuccessful in inducing sustained VT. The patient developed angina during the procedure, which responded to sublingual nitroglycerin. The patient is currently being managed with amiodarone, metoprolol, and aspirin.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Ischemic insult to scar tissue or new ischemic injury: Given the patient's known total occlusion of LCx, there is a risk of ischemic insult to scar tissue or new ischemic injury, which could lead to posterior infarct.
2. P waves present on telemetry: The patient's telemetry showed p waves present while in wide complex tachycardia, which may indicate a risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter.
3. Cardiac enzymes: The patient's cardiac enzymes are slightly elevated, which may indicate muscle damage from defibrillation.
4. Systolic heart failure: The patient has mildly depressed EF, which may indicate systolic heart failure, although the etiology is unclear.
5. Valvular disease: The patient has mild AS and mod MR, which may increase the risk of flash pulmonary edema with VT episodes.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk of infection due to the presence of central lines and the need for repeated defibrillation.
8. Arrhythmia recurrence: The patient's VT/electrical storm may recur, which could lead to further complications.

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue amiodarone and metoprolol as ordered.
2. Increase metoprolol to 25mg PO BID.
3. D/c lidocaine and heparin gtt.
4. Trend cardiac enzymes.
5. Consider starting ACE-I and long-acting beta blocker after procedures.
6. Monitor volume status closely.
7. Consider repeating echocardiogram in 6-12 months.
8. Plan for ICD placement today.
9. Consider discharge tomorrow if stable from the arrhythmia point of view."
