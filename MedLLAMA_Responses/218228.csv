   intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia, work up for PE
   negative, TTE with new wall motion abnormality concerning for ischmia
   .
   #. Chest Pain/WMA - The pt presents with hx of anterior chest
   discomfort occuring at rest for several days, similar to previous
   episodes which occurred during exercise. ECG with new RBBB and ST
   depressions throughout precordium. TTE EF 60%, basal segments of the
   inferior and posterior wall are akinetic, and the midventricular
   segments are hypokinetic, RV cavity is dilated with borderline normal
   free wall function, 3+MR, moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. No further episodes of chest pain since admission
   - Continue IV heparin
   - Continue Plavix
   - Continue lisinopril 2.5 mg daily
   - Pt agreeable to cardiac cath today for further evaluation for CAD
   .
   #. Hypoxia - Pt has history of disordered breathing following stroke,
   has been off CPAP, also has evidence of progression of emphysema and
   ILD on Chest CT. Workup negative for PE
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   -  Pt will need evaluation by Pulmonary as outpatient, eval for home O2
   post-postentional revascularization

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of CVA, type 2 diabetes, and hypothyroidism. He presented with four days of intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia. The patient's ECG showed new RBBB and ST depressions, and his TTE revealed a wall motion abnormality concerning for ischemia. He has a history of disordered breathing following his stroke and has been off CPAP. The patient's chest CT shows diffuse bronchial wall thickening, progression of emphysema, and slight progression of interstitial lung disease. He has been started on Plavix and ASA 325, and his ACEI has been held.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ischemic heart disease: The patient's TTE shows a wall motion abnormality concerning for ischemia, which may indicate a high risk of myocardial infarction.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's chest CT shows diffuse bronchial wall thickening, which may indicate a high risk of pulmonary embolism.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of disordered breathing and progression of emphysema and interstitial lung disease may indicate a high risk of respiratory failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's increased troponin levels and elevated white blood cell count may indicate a high risk of sepsis.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of CVA and his current cardiac condition may increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's increased risk of bleeding due to his anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of hemorrhagic complications.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may exacerbate his cardiac condition and increase his risk of other complications.
8. Diabetes complications: The patient's type 2 diabetes may increase his risk of complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.
9. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia may increase his risk of respiratory failure and other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombotic events.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac condition closely and consider invasive cardiac monitoring.
3. Continue oxygen therapy to maintain a saturation of >88%.
4. Consider further evaluation of the patient's respiratory condition, including a pulmonary function test and a sleep study.
5. Monitor the patient's glycemic control closely and consider adjusting his insulin regimen as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's thyroid function closely and consider adjusting his thyroid medication as necessary.
7. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of his cardiac condition.
8. Consider referring the patient to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management of his respiratory condition.
9. Consider referring the patient to an endocrinologist for further evaluation and management of his diabetes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 89 y/o M with a PMH of CVA in [**2143**] with residual
   disordered breathing, DM type 2 presenting with four days of
   intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia
   .
   #. Chest Pain - The pt presents with hx of anterior chest discomfort
   occuring at rest for several days, similar to previous episodes which
   occurred during exercise. ECG with new RBBB and ST depressions
   throughout precordium. Symptoms are concerning for cardiac vs pulmonary
   etiology. Cardiac enzymes negative X2, D-dimer elevated.  TIMI score 3
   for age, RF and ST changes giving a 13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause
   mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring
   urgent revascularization. However given concurrent hypoxia, elevated
   D-dimer, and new RBBB also concern for PE.
   - Continue IV heparin
   - Continue Aggrenox
   - Continue lisinopril 2.5 mg daily
   - Trend CE - negative X2
   - Pt currently does not want to pursue cardiac catheterization, would
   consider stress testing following rule out of PE, improvement of
   hypoxia
   - Will start pre-contrast hydration for consideration of CTA this am
   .
   #. Hypoxia - The patient with hypoxia requiring NRB, currently weaned
   to 5L NC, no clear evidence of volume overload on exam. Pt has history
   of disordered breathing following stroke, has been off CPAP, also
   history of tobacco use, likely has underlying lung disease. Concern for
   PE as described above
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Discuss risk/benefit of CTA to rule out PE, if no CTA would pursue
   non-contrast Chest CT
   .
   #. Hx of CVA - resulting complex disordered breathing - pt has refused
   further treatment with CPAP or home O2 as outpatient
   - aggrexox transitioned to plavix given concern for ACS
   .
   #. HTN - continue lisinopril

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of CVA, disordered breathing, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a recent presentation with four days of intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, but the ECG shows new RBBB and ST depressions throughout the precordium, which is concerning for cardiac or pulmonary etiology. The patient has a 13% risk of all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization, according to the TIMI score.

The patient's hypoxia is managed with NRB, and they are currently weaned to 5L NC. There is no clear evidence of volume overload on exam, but the patient has a history of disordered breathing following stroke and has been off CPAP. The patient has a history of tobacco use and likely has underlying lung disease, which is a concern for PE.

The patient has refused further treatment with CPAP or home O2 as an outpatient, and they have been transitioned from Aggrenox to Plavix given concern for ACS.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, but the ECG shows new RBBB and ST depressions throughout the precordium, which is concerning for cardiac or pulmonary etiology. The patient has a 13% risk of all-cause mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization, according to the TIMI score.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's hypoxia is managed with NRB, and they are currently weaned to 5L NC. There is no clear evidence of volume overload on exam, but the patient has a history of disordered breathing following stroke and has been off CPAP. The patient has a history of tobacco use and likely has underlying lung disease, which is a concern for PE.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and they require NRB to maintain a saturation level greater than 88%.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to their respiratory status and the presence of indwelling lines and drains.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and they require vasopressors to maintain a systolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg.
6. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and they are at risk for renal insufficiency due to their underlying medical conditions and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to their history of peptic ulcer disease and the use of anticoagulants.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's cardiac enzymes, ECG, and troponin levels to rule out cardiac complications. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and they should be considered for stress testing following the rule-out of PE. The patient's hypoxia should be managed with NRB, and they should be considered for CTA or non-contrast Chest CT to rule out PE. The patient's underlying medical conditions should be managed, and they should be monitored for signs of infection, hemodynamic instability, renal insufficiency, and gastrointestinal bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of CVA, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. He presented with four days of intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia.

The patient's ECHO showed a dilated left ventricle with an EF of 60%, basal segments of the inferior and posterior wall were akinetic, and the midventricular segments were hypokinetic. The right ventricle cavity was dilated with borderline normal free wall function, and there was 3+ mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's CT scan showed diffuse bronchial wall thickening, suggesting bronchitis, progression of emphysema, slight progression of interstitial lung disease, and a large hiatal hernia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, but cardiac enzymes are negative. His white blood cell count is 9.1, hemoglobin is 12.8 g/dL, and platelet count is 135 K/uL.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 83/52 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 23 inspirations per minute.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a soft, non-tender abdomen, and no chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or kyphosis. His skin is intact with no stasis dermatitis, ulcers, scars, or xanthomas.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Chest Pain: Continue IV heparin, Aggrenox, and lisinopril. Trend CE levels. The patient does not want to pursue cardiac catheterization, but may consider stress testing following the rule out of PE and improvement of hypoxia.
2. Hypoxia: Continue O2 NC to maintain a saturation of >88%. Discuss the risk-benefit of CTA to rule out PE, and if not, pursue a non-contrast Chest CT.
3. Hx of CVA: The patient has refused further treatment with CPAP or home O2 as an outpatient.
4. HTN: Continue lisinopril.
5. Type 2 diabetes: Hold metformin while in the house and start insulin SS.
6. Hypothyroidism: Continue synthroid.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's ECHO shows significant wall motion abnormalities, and his troponin levels are elevated, indicating potential cardiac ischemia or infarction.
2. Pulmonary complications: The patient's CT scan shows diffuse bronchial wall thickening and progression of emphysema, which may worsen his hypoxia.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's hypoxia may worsen due to his underlying lung disease, and his refusal to pursue further treatment with CPAP or home O2 may exacerbate this condition.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's large hiatal hernia may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction.
5. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and cardiac enzymes may indicate cardiac ischemia or infarction, which could lead to bleeding complications.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

1. Nutrition: The patient's nutritional needs will be assessed and managed accordingly.
2. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels will be monitored and managed to prevent hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
3. Lines: The patient has two peripheral IV lines in place.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
5. Comments: The patient's code status is full, and his disposition is ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of CVA, DM type 2, and hypothyroidism, admitted with intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia. His ECG shows new RBBB and ST depressions, and his TTE reveals wall motion abnormality concerning for ischemia. He has been diagnosed with bronchitis, emphysema, and interstitial lung disease. He is receiving IV heparin, Plavix, and lisinopril, and has been transitioned from aggrexox to Plavix due to concern for ACS. He has refused further treatment with CPAP or home O2 as an outpatient.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ischemic heart disease: The patient's wall motion abnormality on TTE and ECG changes suggest the possibility of ischemic heart disease, which could lead to myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory distress could progress to respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's D-dimer level is elevated, and his chest CT shows diffuse bronchial wall thickening, which could suggest the possibility of pulmonary embolism.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and CRP level suggest the possibility of infection, which could lead to sepsis.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's ECG changes and wall motion abnormality on TTE could increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
6. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased eGFR suggest the possibility of kidney injury, which could require further evaluation and management.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy and history of gastrointestinal bleeding could increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV heparin and Plavix to manage the patient's ischemic heart disease and pulmonary embolism risk.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider mechanical ventilation if necessary.
3. Evaluate the patient's infection risk and consider antibiotic therapy if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and consider anti-arrhythmic therapy if necessary.
5. Evaluate the patient's kidney function and consider further management if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider prophylactic therapy if necessary.
7. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's diabetes and hypothyroidism."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 89 y/o M with a PMH of CVA in [**2143**] with residual
   disordered breathing, DM type 2 presenting with four days of
   intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia
   .
   #. Chest Pain - The pt presents with hx of anterior chest discomfort
   occuring at rest for several days, similar to previous episodes which
   occurred during exercise. ECG with new RBBB and ST depressions
   throughout precordium. Symptoms are concerning for cardiac vs pulmonary
   etiology. Cardiac enzymes negative X2, D-dimer elevated.  TIMI score 3
   for age, RF and ST changes giving a 13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause
   mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring
   urgent revascularization. However given concurrent hypoxia, elevated
   D-dimer, and new RBBB also concern for PE.
   - Continue IV heparin
   - Continue Aggrenox
   - Continue lisinopril 2.5 mg daily
   - Trend CE - negative X2
   - Pt currently does not want to pursue cardiac catheterization, would
   consider stress testing following rule out of PE, improvement of
   hypoxia
   - Will start pre-contrast hydration for consideration of CTA this am
   .
   #. Hypoxia - The patient with hypoxia requiring NRB, currently weaned
   to 5L NC, no clear evidence of volume overload on exam. Pt has history
   of disordered breathing following stroke, has been off CPAP, also
   history of tobacco use, likely has underlying lung disease. Concern for
   PE as described above
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Discuss risk/benefit of CTA to rule out PE, if no CTA would pursue
   non-contrast Chest CT
   .
   #. Hx of CVA - resulting complex disordered breathing - pt has refused
   further treatment with CPAP or home O2 as outpatient
   - continue aggrenox
   .
   #. HTN - continue lisinopril
   .
   #. Type 2 diabetes - hold metformin while in house, start insulin SS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a past medical history of CVA, DM type 2, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and a history of disordered breathing following stroke. He presents with four days of intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia.

The patient's ECG shows a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 60%, akinetic basal segments of the inferior and posterior wall, and hypokinetic midventricular segments. The right ventricle is dilated with borderline normal free wall function, and there is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's CT scan shows diffuse bronchial wall thickening, progression of emphysema, and slight progression of interstitial lung disease. He has a large hiatal hernia.

The patient's lab results show:

* Elevated troponin levels (0.11-1.13 ng/mL)
* Elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels (44-109 IU/L)
* Elevated lactate levels (1.1 mmol/L)
* Elevated white blood cell count (9.1-14.1 x 10^9/L)
* Elevated platelet count (135-140 x 10^9/L)
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels (17-20 mg/dL)
* Elevated creatinine levels (1.1-1.3 mg/dL)
* Elevated potassium levels (4.0-4.5 mmol/L)
* Elevated calcium levels (8.8-9.1 mg/dL)

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100.1°F)
* Heart rate: 69-90 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 83/52 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 91%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Bilateral absent radial and digital pulses
* No skin lesions or rashes
* No neurologic deficits

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continue IV heparin
* Continue Aggrenox
* Continue lisinopril 2.5 mg daily
* Trend CE - negative X2
* Start pre-contrast hydration for consideration of CTA this am
* Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
* Discuss risk/benefit of CTA to rule out PE, if no CTA would pursue non-contrast Chest CT
* Continue aggrenox
* Continue lisinopril
* Hold metformin while in house, start insulin SS
* Continue synthroid
* NPO pending additional CE, then will start cardiac diet

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or myocardial infarction
* Pulmonary complications: pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure, or pneumonia
* Gastrointestinal complications: gastrointestinal bleeding, bowel obstruction, or pancreatitis
* Renal complications: acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or electrolyte imbalance
* Neurologic complications: stroke, seizures, or brain hemorrhage
* Infection complications: sepsis, septic shock, or multi-organ failure

It is crucial to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, lab results, and physical examination findings to identify any potential complications early on and intervene promptly to prevent adverse outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 89 y/o M with a PMH of CVA in [**2143**] with residual
   disordered breathing, DM type 2 presenting with four days of
   intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia
   .
   #. Chest Pain - The pt presents with hx of anterior chest discomfort
   occuring at rest for several days, similar to previous episodes which
   occurred during exercise. ECG with new RBBB and ST depressions
   throughout precordium. Symptoms are concerning for cardiac vs pulmonary
   etiology. Cardiac enzymes negative X2, D-dimer elevated.  TIMI score 3
   for age, RF and ST changes giving a 13% risk at 14 days of: all-cause
   mortality, new or recurrent MI, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring
   urgent revascularization. However given concurrent hypoxia, elevated
   D-dimer, and new RBBB also concern for PE.
   - Continue IV heparin
   - Continue Aggrenox
   - Continue lisinopril 2.5 mg daily
   - Trend CE - negative X2
   - Pt currently does not want to pursue cardiac catheterization, would
   consider stress testing following rule out of PE, improvement of
   hypoxia
   - Will start pre-contrast hydration for consideration of CTA this am
   .
   #. Hypoxia - The patient with hypoxia requiring NRB, currently weaned
   to 5L NC, no clear evidence of volume overload on exam. Pt has history
   of disordered breathing following stroke, has been off CPAP, also
   history of tobacco use, likely has underlying lung disease. Concern for
   PE as described above
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Discuss risk/benefit of CTA to rule out PE, if no CTA would pursue
   non-contrast Chest CT
   .
   #. Hx of CVA - resulting complex disordered breathing - pt has refused
   further treatment with CPAP or home O2 as outpatient
   - continue aggrenox
   .
   #. HTN - continue lisinopril
   .
   #. Type 2 diabetes - hold metformin while in house, start insulin SS
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism - continue synthroid

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of CVA, disordered breathing, DM type 2, and presenting with four days of intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia. The patient's ECG shows new RBBB and ST depressions throughout the precordium, concerning for cardiac or pulmonary etiology. Cardiac enzymes are negative, and D-dimer is elevated. The patient is currently receiving IV heparin, Aggrenox, and lisinopril, and is being monitored for hypoxia, hypertension, and diabetes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's symptoms, including hypoxia and D-dimer elevation, suggest a high risk of PE. Further evaluation with CT angiography (CTA) or non-contrast chest CT is recommended to rule out PE.
2. Cardiac Ischemia/Infarction: The patient's ECG changes, including new RBBB and ST depressions, suggest cardiac ischemia or infarction. Cardiac enzymes are negative, but further evaluation with cardiac catheterization or stress testing may be necessary to rule out cardiac complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute suggest a high risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory status is necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and elevated D-dimer suggest a high risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values is necessary to detect early signs of sepsis.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism requires close monitoring of thyroid function tests and potential adjustment of thyroid medication.
6. Diabetes: The patient's history of DM type 2 requires close monitoring of blood glucose levels and potential adjustment of insulin therapy.
7. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension requires close monitoring of blood pressure and potential adjustment of antihypertensive therapy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV heparin and Aggrenox to prevent PE and cardiac complications.
2. Continue lisinopril to manage hypertension.
3. Hold metformin and start insulin SS to manage DM type 2.
4. Continue synthroid to manage hypothyroidism.
5. Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory status closely to prevent respiratory failure.
6. Monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory values closely to detect early signs of sepsis.
7. Consider cardiac catheterization or stress testing to rule out cardiac complications.
8. Consider CTA or non-contrast chest CT to rule out PE."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. He has a history of CVA, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. Cardiac catheterization revealed 3-vessel CAD, and a stent was placed in the RCA. The patient is currently receiving aspirin, Plavix, and a beta blocker. He has a history of disordered breathing following his stroke and has been experiencing intermittent anterior chest discomfort. His current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 115/57 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has a history of chest pain and has undergone cardiac catheterization. There is a risk of ACS, particularly with the presence of calcification in the LAD and LCX.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of disordered breathing and has been off CPAP. There is a risk of PE, particularly with the presence of emphysema and ILD on Chest CT.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of CVA and has undergone cardiac catheterization. There is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly with the presence of RV cavity dilatation and borderline normal free wall function.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of disordered breathing and has been experiencing intermittent anterior chest discomfort. There is a risk of respiratory failure, particularly with the presence of emphysema and ILD.
5. Sepsis: The patient has a history of CVA and has undergone cardiac catheterization. There is a risk of sepsis, particularly with the presence of catheter-related infections.
6. Bleeding Complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with Plavix and aspirin. There is a risk of bleeding complications, particularly with the presence of catheter-related bleeding.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and is receiving insulin. There is a risk of hypoglycemia, particularly with the presence of insulin therapy.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is receiving synthroid. There is a risk of hypothyroidism, particularly with the presence of synthroid therapy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and cardiac function closely.
2. Consider repeating the cardiac catheterization to assess for any changes in the patient's coronary artery disease.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as necessary.
4. Consider repeating the Chest CT to assess for any changes in the patient's emphysema and ILD.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory function and consider repeating the spirometry to assess for any changes in lung function.
6. Consider repeating the echocardiogram to assess for any changes in the patient's cardiac function.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and consider repeating the blood pressure monitoring to assess for any changes in blood pressure control.
8. Consider repeating the thyroid function tests to assess for any changes in the patient's thyroid function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of CVA, DM type 2, and hypothyroidism, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. He underwent cardiac catheterization with stent placement to the RCA and was found to have 3-vessel CAD. He is currently being treated with aspirin, Plavix, and beta blockers. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 115/57 mmHg. He has a SpO2 of 88% and is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. His physical examination is unremarkable, except for diminished peripheral pulses.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ischemic complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent stent placement to the RCA may increase his risk of ischemic complications, such as MI, angina, or cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's history of disordered breathing and emphysema may increase his risk of hypoxia, particularly if his oxygen therapy is not adequately titrated.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy with heparin and Plavix may increase his risk of bleeding complications, such as hemorrhagic stroke or gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism may increase his risk of hypothyroidism-related complications, such as fatigue, weight gain, or cold intolerance.
5. Diabetes-related complications: The patient's history of DM type 2 may increase his risk of diabetes-related complications, such as hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis, or nephropathy.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of CAD and recent stent placement may increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
7. Pulmonary complications: The patient's history of emphysema and ILD may increase his risk of pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or pulmonary embolism."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. He has a history of CVA, DM type 2, and hypothyroidism. His cardiac catheterization revealed 3-vessel CAD, with successful stent placement to the RCA. He is currently receiving aspirin, Plavix, and beta blocker therapy. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 115/57 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 88%. His physical examination is notable for diminished radial and pedal pulses, as well as decreased breath sounds in the bilateral lung fields.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's 3-vessel CAD and history of CVA increase his risk for cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.
2. Pulmonary complications: The patient's history of disordered breathing and progression of emphysema and ILD on Chest CT increase his risk for respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy with heparin and Plavix, which increases his risk for bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his indwelling catheters and history of CVA, which can increase his risk for nosocomial infections, such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's history of DM and hypothyroidism increases his risk for nutritional deficiencies, such as malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Medication-related complications: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and beta blockers, which can increase his risk for medication-related complications, such as bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and electrolyte imbalances.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust his medication regimen as needed to prevent cardiac complications.
2. Continue oxygen therapy via nasal cannula to maintain a SpO2 of >88%.
3. Monitor the patient's pulmonary status closely and consider consulting pulmonary for further evaluation and treatment of hypoxia.
4. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust his anticoagulant therapy as needed to prevent bleeding complications.
5. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and consider consulting a nutritionist to develop a personalized nutrition plan.
6. Monitor the patient's medication regimen closely and adjust as needed to prevent medication-related complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old male who presented with four days of intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia. He has a history of CVA, DM type 2, and hypothyroidism. He underwent cardiac catheterization with stent placement to RCA, and was found to have 3-vessel CAD. His post-catheterization medications include aspirin, Plavix, and beta blocker. He has a history of disordered breathing following his CVA and has refused further treatment with CPAP or home O2 as an outpatient.

The patient's current condition is stable, with no further episodes of chest pain since admission. His vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 115/57 mmHg. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 88%. His physical examination is normal, with no acute distress.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.1 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 12.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 135 x 10^9/L. His troponin-T level is 0.13 ng/mL, and his creatinine level is 1.3 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's 3-vessel CAD and recent stent placement to RCA make him at risk for cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and heart failure.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of disordered breathing following his CVA and his current hypoxia make him at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure.
3. Infection: The patient's recent cardiac catheterization and his history of diabetes and hypertension make him at risk for infection, particularly bacteremia and sepsis.
4. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications such as Plavix and aspirin make him at risk for bleeding complications, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Thrombosis: The patient's history of CVA and his current use of anticoagulant medications make him at risk for thrombotic complications, particularly deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
6. Kidney injury: The patient's history of hypertension and his current use of nephrotoxic medications such as beta blockers and ACE inhibitors make him at risk for kidney injury, particularly acute kidney injury.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism and his current use of thyroid hormone replacement therapy make him at risk for hypothyroidism complications, particularly hypothyroidism-related myopathy and neuropathy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of CVA, DM type 2, and hypothyroidism, who was admitted with intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia. He underwent cardiac catheterization with stent placement to the RCA. The patient has developed gastroenteritis, likely viral, with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 69 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 100/49 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 93%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.1-11.4 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 13.6-14.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 140-146 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.1-1.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.11-0.12 ng/mL
* Glucose: 113-236 mg/dL
* Other lab results include elevated levels of lactic acid, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate.

The patient's physical examination is significant for:

* Cardiovascular: S1 and S2 heart sounds are normal, and there is a systolic murmur.
* Respiratory: Breath sounds are clear.
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present.
* Neurological: The patient is attentive and responds to verbal stimuli.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing Plavix, aspirin, and beta blocker for CAD.
* Continuing aspirin, statin, and beta blocker for pump failure.
* Continuing O2 NC to maintain saturation >88%.
* Consult pulmonary for further evaluation and treatment of hypoxia.
* Recommended extensive workup for UIP/ILD and related disordered breathing.
* Continuing IVF and PRN zofran for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
* Holding metformin while in the hospital and starting insulin SS for type 2 diabetes.
* Continuing synthroid for hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Gastroenteritis leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.
* Hypoxia leading to respiratory failure.
* CAD leading to acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
* Pump failure leading to heart failure.
* Hypothyroidism leading to decreased metabolic rate and increased risk of infection.
* Type 2 diabetes leading to hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis.
* Respiratory failure leading to need for mechanical ventilation.
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy.
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: IVF and PRN zofran.
* Glycemic control: Target glucose level of 140-180 mg/dL.
* Lines: 18-gauge and 20-gauge peripheral IV lines.
* Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP prophylaxis.
* Code status: Full code.
* Disposition: Call out to medical floor, PT consult."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a significant medical history, including a previous stroke with residual disordered breathing, type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, and a recent cardiac catheterization with stent placement to the right coronary artery.

The patient has developed several new symptoms, including:

1. Gastroenteritis, likely viral, with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
2. Hypoxia, with a recent chest CT scan showing evidence of progression of emphysema and interstitial lung disease (ILD).
3. Cardiac issues, including a new wall motion abnormality on a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE), which is concerning for ischemia.

The patient is currently being treated with:

1. IV fluids and PRN zofran for nausea and vomiting.
2. O2 delivery via nasal cannula to maintain a saturation of >88%.
3. Cardiac medications, including aspirin, Plavix, and beta blockers.
4. Insulin for type 2 diabetes.
5. Synthroid for hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances due to gastroenteritis and diarrhea.
2. Respiratory failure due to hypoxia and ILD.
3. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, due to the patient's cardiac history and new wall motion abnormality.
4. Infection, such as pneumonia or sepsis, due to the patient's immunocompromised state.
5. Worsening of the patient's ILD and emphysema, leading to respiratory failure.

The patient's current lab results show:

1. WBC: 7.1-11.4 x 10^9/L
2. Hct: 37.2-39.9%
3. Plt: 140-146 x 10^9/L

5. TropT: 0.11-0.12 ng/mL
6. TCO2: 27 mmHg
7. Glucose: 113-236 mg/dL

The patient's current medications include:

1. Aspirin
2. Plavix
3. Beta blockers
4. Insulin
5. Synthroid
6. Lisinopril

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient, an 89-year-old male, is a complex case with a history of CVA, DM type 2, and hypothyroidism. He was admitted with four days of intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia, which was work-up negative for PE. A TTE revealed a new wall motion abnormality concerning for ischemia, and he underwent cardiac catheterization with stent placement to the RCA. The patient has developed gastroenteritis, likely viral, with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 69 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 100/49 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 93% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.1-11.4 K/uL
* Hct: 37.2-39.9%
* Plt: 140-146 K/uL
* Cr: 1.1 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.10-0.13 ng/mL
* TCO2: 27 mmHg
* Glucose: 113-236 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.9/32.7/1.4, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 45/9/0.10, Differential-Neuts: 85.4%, Lymph: 6.6%, Mono: 7.3%, Eos: 0.6%, Lactic Acid: 1.1 mmol/L, Ca++: 8.9 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 2.9 mg/dL

The patient's medication list includes:

* Plavix
* Aspirin
* Beta blocker
* Statin
* Lisinopril
* Insulin SS
* Synthroid
* Omeprazole (Prilosec)
* Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis)

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and interstitial lung disease (ILD)
* Cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias, due to the patient's history of CAD and recent cardiac catheterization
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as sepsis or bowel perforation, due to the patient's acute gastroenteritis
* Infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, due to the patient's immobility and underlying medical conditions
* Hemorrhagic complications, such as bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract or intracranial hemorrhage, due to the patient's history of CVA and anticoagulation therapy.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

* Continue O2 therapy to maintain oxygen saturation >88%
* Trial diuresis with lasix bolus to manage fluid overload
* Continue IVF and PRN zofran for nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
* Monitor for signs of respiratory failure and cardiac complications
* Continue prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy as indicated
* Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal complications and infections
* Consider consulting with a pulmonologist and infectious disease specialist to manage the patient's respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms."

   has been off CPAP, also has evidence of progression of emphysema and
   ILD on Chest CT. Workup negative for PE
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Will trial diuresis with lasix bolus
   - Appreciate Pulmonary consult recommendations
 concern for UIP/ILD
   and related disordered. Requested labs pending including BNP, ESR, [**Doctor First Name **],
   Anti SCL-70, Anti centromere Ab, RF, hepatitis serologies,
   immunoglobulin levels, SPEP, and UPEP. Also recommended ongoing
   diuresis
   .
   # Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea: Pt developed acute N/V/D this
   admission consistent with a viral gastroenteritis.
   - Already improving after <24hrs
   - Continue IVF and PRN zofran
   .
   #. Hx of CVA - resulting complex disordered breathing - pt has refused
   further treatment with CPAP or home O2 as outpatient
   - aggrexox transitioned to plavix given concern for ACS
   .
   #. HTN - continue lisinopril, metoprolol as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   89 y/o M with a PMH of CVA in [**2143**] with residual disordered breathing,
   DM type 2 presenting with four days of intermittent anterior chest
   discomfort and new hypoxia, work up for PE negative, TTE with new wall
   motion abnormality concerning for ischmia now s/p cardiac catherization
   with stent placement to RCA. Now seems to have developed
   gastroenteritis, likely viral
   .
   #. CAD - ECG with new RBBB and ST depressions throughout precordium.
   TTE EF 60%, basal segments of the inferior and posterior wall are
   akinetic, and the midventricular segments are hypokinetic, RV cavity is
   dilated with borderline normal free wall function, 3+MR, moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No further episodes of chest
   pain since admission. Patient s/p DES to RCA.
   - off IV heparin
   - Continue Plavix, aspirin, beta blocker
   .
   # Pump
 previous echo from [**2-/2146**] demonstrates mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional
   biventricular systolic function. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation.
   - cont aspirin, statin, beta blocker
   - restarted Lisinopril. Uptitrate as tolerated
   #. Hypoxia - Pt has history of disordered breathing following stroke,
   has been off CPAP, also has evidence of progression of emphysema and
   ILD on Chest CT. Workup negative for PE
   - Continue O2 NC to maintain sat >88%
   - Will trial diuresis with lasix bolus
   - Appreciate Pulmonary consult recommendations
 concern for UIP/ILD
   and related disordered. Requested labs pending including BNP, ESR, [**Doctor First Name **],
   Anti SCL-70, Anti centromere Ab, RF, hepatitis serologies,
   immunoglobulin levels, SPEP, and UPEP. Also recommended ongoing
   diuresis
   .
   # Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea: Pt developed acute N/V/D this
   admission consistent with a viral gastroenteritis.
   - Already improving after <24hrs
   - Continue IVF and PRN zofran
   .
   #. Hx of CVA - resulting complex disordered breathing - pt has refused
   further treatment with CPAP or home O2 as outpatient
   - aggrexox transitioned to plavix given concern for ACS
   .
   #. HTN - continue lisinopril, metoprolol as above
   .
   #. Type 2 diabetes - hold metformin while in house, start insulin SS

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 89-year-old male with a history of CVA, DM type 2, and hypothyroidism, who was admitted with four days of intermittent anterior chest discomfort and new hypoxia. The patient was found to have a wall motion abnormality on TTE, which was treated with cardiac catheterization and stent placement to the RCA. 

The patient has developed gastroenteritis, likely viral, with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient's condition has improved with IVF and PRN zofran. 

The patient has a history of complex disordered breathing following his stroke, and has refused further treatment with CPAP or home O2 as an outpatient. The patient's blood work shows an elevated WBC count, and the patient is at risk for developing pneumonia. 

The patient's medications include Plavix, aspirin, beta blocker, statin, and Lisinopril. The patient is also taking insulin SS and synthroid. 

The patient's current vital signs are: Tmax: 36.9°C, Tcurrent: 36.3°C, HR: 69 bpm, BP: 100/49 mmHg, RR: 19 inspirations per minute, and SpO2: 93%. The patient's physical examination is unchanged from admission except for the development of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's history of complex disordered breathing and refusal of further treatment with CPAP or home O2 as an outpatient puts the patient at risk for developing pneumonia.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastroenteritis and history of anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and Plavix put the patient at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of cardiac catheterization and stent placement to the RCA, as well as his current medications, put the patient at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of complex disordered breathing and hypoxia put the patient at risk for respiratory failure.
5. Sepsis: The patient's history of gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated WBC count put the patient at risk for developing sepsis.
6. Gastrointestinal perforation: The patient's gastroenteritis and history of anticoagulation therapy put the patient at risk for gastrointestinal perforation.
7. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of liver disease and anticoagulation therapy put the patient at risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy.
8. Renal failure: The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes put the patient at risk for developing renal failure.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."
