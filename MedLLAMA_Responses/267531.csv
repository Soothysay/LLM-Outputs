   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, presenting with atrial
   flutter and large mediastinal mass, pulmonary nodules and now intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression.
   .
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and Weightloss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanamoa or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.
   - Continue AC ventilation with Sedation
   - F/u Nutrition c/s for TF recs
   - F/u Path report
   - Appreciate IP recs
   - Await Hem/Onc recs
   - Rad onc c/s pending path
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence. Ruled out by enzymes. Remains in NSR at this time.
   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem
   .
   # Asthma: Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoid bronchodilators as they will exacerbate atrial
   flutter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of locally advanced melanoma, who presented with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, atrial flutter, and a large mediastinal mass, pulmonary nodules, and is currently intubated after bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure of 86/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is sedated and easily arousable, with a regular heart rhythm and normal S1 and S2 heart sounds.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 16.4 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 33.8%
* Platelet count: 387 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 143 mg/dL
* Other lab results include:

* PT/PTT/INR: 12.6/24.2/1.1
* Differential-Neuts: 88.8%
* Lymph: 8.5%
* Mono: 2.2%
* Eos: 0.3%
* Ca++: 8.1 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.5 mg/dL

The patient's diagnosis is acute respiratory failure, not ARDS, and atrial flutter. The patient is at high risk of recurrence of atrial flutter and is being treated with rate control using diltiazem.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and any further decline in lung function could lead to respiratory failure.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial flutter is a significant risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
* Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged hospitalization increase the risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
* Metastatic disease: The patient's large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules suggest possible metastatic disease, which could lead to further complications, including respiratory failure and cardiac arrhythmias.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy and the presence of a mediastinal mass increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and impaired nutritional intake increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies, including protein-calorie malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, and nutritional status, as well as ongoing assessment of her laboratory results and imaging studies to guide treatment decisions."

 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, presenting with atrial
   flutter and large mediastinal mass, pulmonary nodules and now intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression.
   .
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.
   - Continue AC ventilation with Sedation

   - F/u Path report
   - Appreciate IP recs

   - Rad onc c/s pending path
   - No Beta agonists as unlikey to reverse fixed obstruction, and may
   exacerbate Aflutter
   - Echocardiogram for Monday
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence. Ruled out by enzymes. Remains in NSR at this time.
   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem (decrease to 60 mg QID given low BPs this
   morning)

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of locally advanced melanoma, intubated and ventilated in the ICU due to respiratory failure and atrial flutter. She presented with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, and a large mediastinal mass, pulmonary nodules, and atrial flutter. The patient is currently receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, and blood pressure of 86/53 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on 40% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 16.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 387 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to external bronchial compression by the mediastinal mass, and may worsen if the mass is not addressed.
2. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is likely related to pericardial tumor involvement and may recur. Rate control with diltiazem is being used to manage the arrhythmia.
3. Metastatic disease: The patient's large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules suggest metastatic disease, which may not be fully addressed by current therapy.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's respiratory failure and sedation may lead to malnutrition, which could worsen her overall condition.
5. Infection: The patient's respiratory failure and immunosuppression may increase her risk of infection, which could be life-threatening.
6. Hemorrhage: The patient's respiratory failure and coagulopathy may increase her risk of bleeding, which could be life-threatening.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial flutter and potential metastatic disease may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

Based on these potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy as needed to prevent or manage these complications."

 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, presenting with atrial
   flutter and large mediastinal mass, pulmonary nodules and now intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression.
   .
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and Weightloss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanamoa or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.
   - Continue AC ventilation with Sedation
   - F/u Nutrition c/s for TF recs
   - F/u Path report
   - Appreciate IP recs
   - Await Hem/Onc recs
   - Rad onc c/s pending path
   - No Beta agonists as unlikey to reverse fixed obstruction, and may
   exacerbate Aflutter
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence. Ruled out by enzymes. Remains in NSR at this time.
   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem
   .
   # Asthma: Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoid bronchodilators as they will exacerbate atrial
   flutter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, presenting with atrial
   flutter and large mediastinal mass, pulmonary nodules and now intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression.
   .
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and Weightloss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanamoa or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.

   .
   # Atrial Flutter: Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence. Ruled out by enzymes. Remains in NSR at this time.
   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of locally advanced melanoma, intubated and receiving invasive ventilation after bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression. The patient has atrial flutter, which is likely related to pericardial tumor involvement, and is at high risk of recurrence. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 98% on 40% FiO2.

The patient has a mediastinal mass, which is causing dyspnea and weight loss, and may be related to lymphoma, melanoma, or lung primary. The patient is at risk for metastatic disease, and it is unclear whether they will tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already intubated and receiving invasive ventilation, and there is a risk of further respiratory decline.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has atrial flutter, which is a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia, and may be at risk for further cardiac complications.
3. Metastatic disease: The patient has a mediastinal mass, which may be related to metastatic disease, and may require further treatment and management.
4. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving enteral nutrition, but may be at risk for nutritional deficiencies if the tube is not properly managed.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the invasive ventilation and presence of a mediastinal mass.
6. Bleeding: The patient has a mediastinal mass, which may be causing bleeding or may be at risk for bleeding due to the presence of a tumor.
7. Cardiac tamponade: The patient has a mediastinal mass, which may be causing cardiac tamponade, a potentially life-threatening condition.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, metastatic disease, nutritional deficiencies, infection, bleeding, and cardiac tamponade. It is essential to monitor the patient closely and manage their care accordingly to prevent or minimize these complications."

   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, and atrial flutter found
   to have large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules and now intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression.
   .
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.  Episode overnight with increased sputum/secretions
   and fever suggestive of possible PNA (post-obstructive likely given
   anatomy). Now PEEP increased to 10, FiO2 increased to 50%. Most likely
   will go to OR on Tuesday for bronchial stenting. Will also try to
   re-position ETT as > 5 cm above carina.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this

   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.  Episode overnight with increased sputum/secretions
   and fever suggestive of possible PNA (post-obstructive likely given
   anatomy). Now PEEP increased to 10, FiO2 increased to 50%. Most likely
   will go to OR on Tuesday for bronchial stenting. Will also try to

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of locally advanced melanoma, intubated due to a large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules. She is currently being treated for atrial flutter, which is likely related to pericardial tumor involvement. She has developed fever, increased sputum/secretions, and a drop in O2 sats, which may be related to possible PNA (post-obstructive likely given anatomy). She is being treated with vancomycin and zosyn for possible VAP, and will undergo bronchial stenting and re-positioning of the ETT.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's fever, increased sputum/secretions, and drop in O2 sats may be indicative of pneumonia, which could worsen her respiratory status.
2. VAP: The patient's increased risk of VAP due to her intubation and underlying medical conditions may lead to further respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter may recur, which could lead to further cardiac complications and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's risk of pulmonary embolism is increased due to her immobility and underlying medical conditions, which could lead to further respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Sepsis: The patient's fever and increased sputum/secretions may be indicative of sepsis, which could lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's intubation and underlying medical conditions may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and constipation, which could worsen her overall condition.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient's intubation and underlying medical conditions may lead to nutritional complications such as malnutrition and dehydration, which could worsen her overall condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
2. Consider adding antibiotics to her treatment plan to cover for possible PNA.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
4. Consider adding anticoagulation therapy to her treatment plan to reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
6. Consider adding nutritional support to her treatment plan to prevent malnutrition and dehydration.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's overall condition closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, and atrial flutter found
   to have large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules and now intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression.
   .
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.

   - Rad onc c/s pending path
   - No Beta agonists as unlikey to reverse fixed obstruction, and may

   # Atrial Flutter: Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence. Ruled out by enzymes. Remains in NSR at this time.
   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem (continue on 60 mg QID)
   .
   #Fever:  No definitive source but in a ventilated patient with

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of locally advanced melanoma, currently intubated and ventilated due to a large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules. She has developed atrial flutter, which has reverted to normal sinus rhythm, but is at high risk of recurrence. The patient has a fever, with no definitive source, and is being treated for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has wheezing, likely due to tumor airway involvement, and is not a candidate for bronchodilators. The patient's condition is stable, but she is at risk of developing complications due to her underlying disease and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's fever, increasing secretions, and drop in oxygen saturation could be indicative of VAP. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and zosyn, but close monitoring and further testing are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's immobility and underlying disease make her at risk for developing a PE. Close monitoring of her vital signs and oxygen saturation is necessary, and further testing may be necessary if symptoms develop.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial flutter and possible pericardial tumor involvement make her at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure. Close monitoring of her cardiac status is necessary, and further testing may be necessary if symptoms develop.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying disease and treatments make her at risk for developing respiratory failure. Close monitoring of her oxygen saturation and respiratory status is necessary, and further testing may be necessary if symptoms develop.
5. Infection: The patient's fever and increasing secretions make her at risk for developing a secondary infection. Close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results is necessary, and further testing may be necessary if symptoms develop.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, oxygen saturation, and laboratory results.
2. Further testing, such as a CT scan or MRI, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of VAP or other complications.
3. Adjust the patient's treatment plan as necessary based on the results of further testing and the patient's response to treatment.
4. Consider consulting with a pulmonologist or cardiologist for further guidance on the patient's management.
5. Continue to provide close monitoring and support to the patient and her family throughout her hospitalization."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea found to have large
   mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules and now intubated s/p
   bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression with hospital
   course complicated by Atrial flutter.
   .
   # Respiratory
   - keep intubated pending IP intervention,? temporary stent placement
   - consider PSV with plan to extubate in next day.
   - humidified air, suction, treatment of pneumonia
   - stop maintenance fluids as patient TBB positive; consider lasix if
   still volume up
   - lighten sedation
   - check ABG today
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.  Episode overnight with increased sputum/secretions
   and fever suggestive of possible PNA (post-obstructive likely given
   anatomy). Now PEEP increased to 10, FiO2 increased to 50%. Most likely
   will go to OR on Tuesday for bronchial stenting. Will also try to
   re-position ETT as > 5 cm above carina.

   - Echocardiogram for Monday
   - Continue vanco/zosyn for now

   - F/U final read CXR
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence. Ruled out by enzymes. Remains in NSR at this time.
   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem , decrease dosage to 30 mg QID.
   # Pneumonia
 patient appears to have LLL > RLL infiltrate and has been
   persistently febrile to 102 with leukocytosis.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue vancomycin/zosyn
   - check vancomycin trough

   #Fever:  No definitive source but in a ventilated patient with
   increasing thick secretions and drop in O2 sats could be concerning for
   pulmonary infection.  UA not suggestive of urinary tract infection

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of locally advanced melanoma, intubated due to respiratory distress, and presenting with a large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules. She has been experiencing fever, cough, and thick yellow secretions. The patient has atrial flutter, which has been treated with rate control medications. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics. The patient's condition is complicated by the presence of a mediastinal mass, which is likely causing her respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to her mediastinal mass, pneumonia, and atrial flutter.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, which can lead to further complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, and multi-organ failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial flutter can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
5. Metastatic disease: The patient's mediastinal mass is likely to be a metastatic tumor, which can spread to other parts of the body, leading to further complications.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat due to her respiratory distress can lead to nutritional deficiencies, which can further complicate her condition.
7. Infection: The patient's indwelling lines and tubes increase her risk of infection, which can be life-threatening.
8. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's mediastinal mass and pneumonia can lead to hemodynamic instability, which can be life-threatening.
9. Delayed diagnosis: The patient's symptoms may be masked by her respiratory distress, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment of her underlying conditions.
10. Organ dysfunction: The patient's underlying conditions can lead to organ dysfunction, such as renal failure, liver failure, or gastrointestinal failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial flutter and respiratory failure. Over the past 24 hours, the patient's temperature has been elevated, with a peak of 102.0°F. The patient has been experiencing thick secretions, which have improved slightly with humidified air. The patient is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and is being treated with fentanyl and midazolam for pain and anxiety.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 98/54 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a peak of 16.4 K/uL. The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.2 g/dL, and his platelet count is 387 K/uL. The patient's creatinine level is 0.4 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen level is 27 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated temperature and white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the source of the infection and to initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed. Further evaluation of the patient's respiratory status is needed to determine the best course of treatment.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial flutter may worsen if not properly managed. Further evaluation of the patient's cardiac status is needed to determine the best course of treatment.
4. Bloodstream infection: The patient's central line is at risk for bloodstream infection. Further evaluation is needed to determine the best course of treatment to prevent this complication.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture growing gram-positive cocci in pairs/clusters suggests the possibility of pneumonia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the best course of treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's temperature and white blood cell count closely to determine the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy.
3. Further evaluate the patient's respiratory status to determine the best course of treatment.
4. Continue cardiac monitoring to determine the best course of treatment for atrial flutter.
5. Consider removing the central line to prevent bloodstream infection.
6. Consider adding antifungal therapy to the patient's antibiotic regimen if the sputum culture grows a fungal organism."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, and atrial flutter found
   to have large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules and now intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression.
   .
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.  Episode overnight with increased sputum/secretions
   and fever suggestive of possible PNA (post-obstructive likely given
   anatomy). Now PEEP increased to 10, FiO2 increased to 50%. Most likely
   will go to OR on Tuesday for bronchial stenting. Will also try to
   re-position ETT as > 5 cm above carina.

   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem (continue on 60 mg QID)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of locally advanced melanoma, intubated for bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression. She has a large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules, with concern for metastatic disease. She has developed a fever, with no definitive source, and is experiencing increased sputum and secretions, suggesting possible post-obstructive pneumonia. Her respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. She is also receiving sedation and has a plan for bronchial stenting on Tuesday.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Infection: The patient's fever, increased sputum and secretions, and drop in oxygen saturation suggest a possible pulmonary infection. Further workup, including sputum and blood cultures, is necessary to determine the etiology of the infection.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation increase her risk of developing VAP. The use of vancomycin and zosyn for possible VAP is appropriate.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is likely related to pericardial tumor involvement. The risk of recurrence is high, and further management, including anticoagulation and rate control, is necessary.
4. Tumor Progression: The patient's mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules suggest tumor progression, which may require further treatment, including chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and further deterioration may lead to respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of her respiratory support is necessary.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's atrial flutter and possible pericardial tumor involvement increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation may lead to nutritional deficiencies, including malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, or gastrointestinal complications. Close monitoring and management of her nutrition is necessary.
8. Infection Control: The patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation increase her risk of developing hospital-acquired infections, including central line-associated bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, or surgical site infections. Close monitoring and management of her infection control is necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of locally advanced melanoma, presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, and a large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 102.0°F (39.0°C), heart rate of 77 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 98/54 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on 50% FiO2. Her respiratory support includes a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilator mode, with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a differential count of 83.3% neutrophils, 10.9% lymphocytes, and 4.4% monocytes. Her blood cultures are pending, and her urine cultures are negative. Her sputum culture shows gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.

The patient's diagnosis is likely related to her mediastinal mass, which is causing external bronchial compression and pulmonary nodules. The patient's symptoms, including dyspnea, weight loss, and fever, are likely related to this mass.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's fever, cough, and thick yellow secretions may indicate pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation make her at risk for VAP.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever may indicate sepsis.
4. Atrial flutter: The patient's history of atrial flutter and the presence of a mediastinal mass may increase her risk for recurrent atrial flutter.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's immobility and prolonged mechanical ventilation make her at risk for pulmonary embolism.
6. Metastatic disease: The patient's mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules may indicate metastatic disease, which could worsen her prognosis.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support may not be sufficient to manage her respiratory failure, which could worsen her condition.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation with sedation.
2. Increase PEEP to 10 and FiO2 to 50%.
3. Re-position the endotracheal tube (ETT) to > 5 cm above the carina.
4. Perform bronchoscopy on Tuesday for bronchial stenting.
5. Continue vancomycin and zosyn for possible VAP.

   prior to antibiotic change (1600 [**2104-5-12**]). Plan for left mainstem stent
   today with IP.
   -TTE:
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
   is no pericardial effusion. There is a mediastinal mass compressing the
   heart.
   IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
   No diastolic dysfunction or pathologic valvular disease seen.
   There is a mediastinal mass measuring approximately 5cm x 6cm that
   compresses the left atrium slightly.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a mediastinal mass compressing the left atrium. The patient's condition has been stable, with a fever spike to 102.3°C prior to a change in antibiotics. A trans-thoracic echo revealed normal global and regional biventricular systolic function, no diastolic dysfunction, and no pathologic valvular disease. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 83/45 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is closely monitored, and the risk of respiratory failure is high due to the mediastinal mass compressing the left atrium.
2. Cardiac compromise: The mediastinal mass may cause cardiac compromise, including decreased cardiac output, arrhythmias, and decreased left ventricular function.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and positive blood cultures suggest the possibility of sepsis, which may lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, which may lead to hyperglycemic complications, such as dehydration and increased risk of infection.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus, are abnormal, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications.
7. DVT: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and the presence of central lines.
8. VAP: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the presence of a central line and mechanical ventilation.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to the presence of a central line and the use of vasopressors.
10. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and the presence of a central line may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea found to have large
   mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules and now intubated s/p
   bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression with hospital
   course complicated by Atrial flutter.
   .
   # Respiratory
   - keep intubated pending IP intervention
   - consider PSV with plan to extubate in next day.
   - humidified air, suction, treatment of pneumonia
   - stop maintenance fluids as patient TBB positive; consider lasix if
   still volume up
   - lighten sedation
   - check ABG today
   - Plan for OR for placement of stent to left main bronchus today; need
   to touch base with IP to discuss when the patient will be going to OR.
   - will decrease respiratory rate by 2 at a time until the patient is
   overbreathing the vent.  At that time, patient can more easily be
   transitioned to PSV.
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.  Episode overnight with increased sputum/secretions
   and fever suggestive of possible PNA (post-obstructive likely given
   anatomy). Now PEEP increased to 10, FiO2 increased to 50%. Most likely
   will go to OR on Tuesday for bronchial stenting. Will also try to
   re-position ETT as > 5 cm above carina.
   - Continue AC ventilation with sedation
   - F/u Nutrition c/s for TF recs
   - F/u Path report (expect cytology today)
   - Appreciate IP recs
   - F/U Hem/Onc recs
   - Rad onc c/s pending path
   - No Beta agonists as unlikey to reverse fixed obstruction, and may
   exacerbate Aflutter
   - Echocardiogram for Monday
   - Continue vanco/levofloxacin for now
   - F/U sputum cx sensitivities, blood cx
   - F/U final read CXR
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence. Ruled out by enzymes. Remains in NSR at this time.
   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem , maintain dosage to 30 mg QID and
   monitor for hypotension.
   # Pneumonia
 patient appears to have LLL > RLL infiltrate and has been
   persistently febrile with leukocytosis. Xray today concerning for
   increase in infiltrate versus left pleural effusion.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue vancomycin/levofloxacin
   - check vancomycin trough and dose appropriately
   - CT Chest (non contrast) to eval lung parenchyma to eval effusion
   versus airspace disease
   .
   #Fever:  No definitive source but in a ventilated patient with
   increasing thick secretions and drop in O2 sats could be concerning for
   pulmonary infection.  UA not suggestive of urinary tract infection
   Moraxella in sputum.
   -f/u blood cx
   -continue vancomycin and levaquin for possible VAP (day 3)
   # Asthma: Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoid bronchodilators as they will exacerbate atrial
   flutter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   -TTE:
   The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests normal diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free
   wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
   thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There
   is no pericardial effusion. There is a mediastinal mass compressing the
   heart.
   IMPRESSION: Normal global and regional biventricular systolic function.
   No diastolic dysfunction or pathologic valvular disease seen.
   There is a mediastinal mass measuring approximately 5cm x 6cm that
   compresses the left atrium slightly.

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of locally advanced melanoma, who is currently intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by a large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and her recent echocardiogram showed normal global and regional biventricular systolic function, with a mediastinal mass compressing the left atrium. She has also developed atrial flutter, which has been controlled with medication. Her fever has been increasing, and she has been treated with antibiotics. The plan is to perform a bronchial stenting procedure today, and she will likely be taken to the operating room for further management of the mediastinal mass.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she requires mechanical ventilation. She may develop further respiratory failure if the mediastinal mass continues to compress her lungs.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, which may worsen if not properly treated. She may develop further complications such as sepsis or respiratory failure.
3. Atrial flutter: The patient has developed atrial flutter, which may recur if not properly managed. She may require further medication or cardioversion to control her heart rhythm.
4. Mediastinal mass: The patient has a large mediastinal mass that is compressing her lungs and heart. This may worsen if not properly managed, and she may require further surgery or radiation therapy.
5. Fever: The patient's fever has been increasing, and she may develop further complications such as sepsis or organ dysfunction if not properly managed.
6. Worsening of respiratory status: The patient's respiratory status may worsen if the mediastinal mass continues to compress her lungs, or if she develops further complications such as pneumonia or sepsis.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient may develop further cardiovascular complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias if the mediastinal mass continues to compress her heart.
8. Neurological complications: The patient may develop further neurological complications such as seizures or altered mental status if she develops further respiratory or cardiovascular complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea found to have large
   mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules and now intubated s/p
   bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression with hospital
   course complicated by Atrial flutter.
   .
   # Respiratory
   - keep intubated pending IP intervention
   - consider PSV with plan to extubate in next day.
   - humidified air, suction, treatment of pneumonia
   - stop maintenance fluids as patient TBB positive; consider lasix if
   still volume up
   - lighten sedation
   - check ABG today
   - Plan for OR for placement of stent to left main bronchus today
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.  Episode overnight with increased sputum/secretions
   and fever suggestive of possible PNA (post-obstructive likely given
   anatomy). Now PEEP increased to 10, FiO2 increased to 50%. Most likely
   will go to OR on Tuesday for bronchial stenting. Will also try to
   re-position ETT as > 5 cm above carina.
   - Continue AC ventilation with Sedation
   - F/u Nutrition c/s for TF recs
   - F/u Path report (expect cytology today)
   - Appreciate IP recs
   - Await Hem/Onc recs (will see patient on Monday)
   - Rad onc c/s pending path
   - No Beta agonists as unlikey to reverse fixed obstruction, and may
   exacerbate Aflutter
   - Echocardiogram for Monday
   - Continue vanco/zosyn for now
   - F/U sputum cx, blood cx
   - F/U final read CXR
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence. Ruled out by enzymes. Remains in NSR at this time.
   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem , decrease dosage to 30 mg QID.
   # Pneumonia
 patient appears to have LLL > RLL infiltrate and has been
   persistently febrile with leukocytosis.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue vancomycin/zosyn
   - check vancomycin trough
   .
   #Fever:  No definitive source but in a ventilated patient with
   increasing thick secretions and drop in O2 sats could be concerning for
   pulmonary infection.  UA not suggestive of urinary tract infection
   Moraxella in sputum.
   -f/u blood cx
   -continue vancomycin and zosyn for possible VAP (day 2)
   # Asthma: Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoid bronchodilators as they will exacerbate atrial
   flutter.
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea found to have large
   mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules and now intubated s/p
   bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression with hospital
   course complicated by Atrial flutter.
   .
   # Respiratory
   - keep intubated pending IP intervention
   - consider PSV with plan to extubate in next day.
   - humidified air, suction, treatment of pneumonia
   - stop maintenance fluids as patient TBB positive; consider lasix if
   still volume up
   - lighten sedation
   - check ABG today
   - Plan for OR for placement of stent to left main bronchus today
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.  Episode overnight with increased sputum/secretions
   and fever suggestive of possible PNA (post-obstructive likely given
   anatomy). Now PEEP increased to 10, FiO2 increased to 50%. Most likely
   will go to OR on Tuesday for bronchial stenting. Will also try to
   re-position ETT as > 5 cm above carina.
   - Continue AC ventilation with Sedation
   - F/u Nutrition c/s for TF recs
   - F/u Path report (expect cytology today)
   - Appreciate IP recs
   - Await Hem/Onc recs (will see patient on Monday)
   - Rad onc c/s pending path
   - No Beta agonists as unlikey to reverse fixed obstruction, and may
   exacerbate Aflutter
   - Echocardiogram for Monday
   - Continue vanco/zosyn for now
   - F/U sputum cx, blood cx
   - F/U final read CXR
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence. Ruled out by enzymes. Remains in NSR at this time.
   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem , decrease dosage to 30 mg QID.
   # Pneumonia
 patient appears to have LLL > RLL infiltrate and has been
   persistently febrile with leukocytosis.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue vancomycin/zosyn
   - check vancomycin trough
   .
   #Fever:  No definitive source but in a ventilated patient with
   increasing thick secretions and drop in O2 sats could be concerning for
   pulmonary infection.  UA not suggestive of urinary tract infection
   Moraxella in sputum.
   -f/u blood cx
   -continue vancomycin and zosyn for possible VAP (day 2)
   # Asthma: Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoid bronchodilators as they will exacerbate atrial
   flutter.
   .

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of locally advanced melanoma, intubated due to respiratory failure, and presenting with a large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules. The patient has been experiencing fever, worsening dyspnea, and decreased oxygen saturation.

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 16.4
* Hct: 33.8
* Plt: 387
* Cr: 0.4
* TCO2: 29
* Glucose: 143
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 15.0/34.7/1.3, Differential-Neuts: 86.6%, Lymph: 7.0%, Mono: 4.6%, Eos: 1.5%, Ca++: 7.8 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL, PO4: 2.6 mg/dL

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, atrial flutter, and a mediastinal mass. The mediastinal mass is compressing the left atrium and is likely related to the patient's tumor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and the development of respiratory failure can occur if the mediastinal mass compresses the trachea or bronchi further.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has already developed pneumonia, and the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is high.
3. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is likely related to the mediastinal mass and can recur if not properly managed.
4. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's mediastinal mass can compress the heart and lead to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac tamponade or cardiac arrest.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's tumor can compress the gastrointestinal tract and lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, obstruction, or perforation.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's tumor can compress the spinal cord or brain and lead to neurological deficits or death.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Intubation and mechanical ventilation to support respiratory function.
2. Antibiotics to treat pneumonia.
3. Bronchial stenting to relieve airway compression.
4. Chemotherapy to treat the mediastinal mass.
5. Sedation to manage pain and anxiety.
6. Fluid management to prevent fluid overload.
7. Electrolyte management to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
8. Monitoring of vital signs, lab results, and imaging studies to track the patient's progress.

The patient's code status is full, and the family has been informed of the patient's condition and treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   3. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea found to have large
   mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules and now intubated s/p
   bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression with hospital
   course complicated by Atrial flutter.
   .
   # Respiratory
   - keep intubated pending IP intervention
   - consider PSV with plan to extubate when stable after IP intervention.
   - humidified air, suction, treatment of pneumonia
   - stop maintenance fluids as patient TBB positive; consider lasix if
   still volume up
   - lighten sedation
   - check ABG today
   - Plan for OR for placement of stent to left main bronchus today
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.  Episode overnight with increased sputum/secretions
   and fever suggestive of possible PNA (post-obstructive likely given
   anatomy). Now PEEP increased to 10, FiO2 increased to 50%. Most likely
   will go to OR on Tuesday for bronchial stenting. Will also try to
   re-position ETT as > 5 cm above carina.
   - Continue AC ventilation with sedation

   - Continue vanco/levofloxacin for now
   - F/U sputum cx sensitivities, blood cx
   - F/U final read CXR
   - likely transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] after IP intervention (and when clinically
   stable after intervention)
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence. Ruled out by enzymes. Remains in NSR at this time.
   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem , maintain dosage to 30 mg QID and
   monitor for hypotension.
   # Pneumonia
 patient appears to have LLL > RLL infiltrate and has been
   persistently febrile with leukocytosis. Xray today concerning for
   increase in infiltrate versus left pleural effusion.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue vancomycin/levofloxacin
   - check vancomycin trough and dose appropriately
   .

Based on the physician's daily progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

Patient Summary:

* The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of locally advanced melanoma, who presented with dysphagia and worsening dyspnea.
* She has a large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules, and was found to have external bronchial compression during bronchoscopy.
* The patient is currently intubated and has been diagnosed with malignant melanoma.
* She has a history of atrial flutter, which has been controlled with medication, and has a risk of recurrence.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia: The patient has a persistent fever and leukocytosis, and has been diagnosed with pneumonia. She has a large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules, which may be contributing to her respiratory distress.
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has a risk of developing VAP.
	* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require further interventions to manage her respiratory distress.
2. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which has been controlled with medication, but may recur.
	* Pericardial effusion: The patient's mediastinal mass may be causing pericardial effusion, which can lead to cardiac tamponade.
3. Infection:
	* Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and leukocytosis may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
	* Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures are positive for Moraxella, which may indicate bacteremia.
4. Other Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's mediastinal mass may be causing gastrointestinal obstruction or bleeding.
	* Neurological complications: The patient's mediastinal mass may be causing neurological symptoms such as headaches, seizures, or cranial nerve palsies.
	* Hematological complications: The patient's malignant melanoma may be causing hematological complications such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, or coagulopathy.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and infectious complications. Further interventions may be necessary to manage her respiratory distress, atrial flutter, and sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 year old woman with past medical history significant only for
   locally advanced melanoma s/p wide marginal excision in [**2100**],
   presenting with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea found to have large
   mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules and now intubated s/p
   bronchoscopy revealing external bronchial compression with hospital
   course complicated by Atrial flutter.
   .
   # Respiratory
   - keep intubated pending IP intervention
 taken off of OR list for
   today; will F/U IP recs
   - consider PSV with plan to extubate when stable after IP intervention.
   - humidified air, suction, treatment of pneumonia
   - stop maintenance fluids as patient TBB positive; consider lasix if
   still volume up
   - lighten sedation
   - check ABG today
   - Plan for OR for placement of stent to left main bronchus today
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to
   mass management.  Episode overnight with increased sputum/secretions
   and fever suggestive of possible PNA (post-obstructive likely given
   anatomy). Now PEEP increased to 10, FiO2 increased to 50%. Most likely
   will go to OR on Tuesday for bronchial stenting. Will also try to
   re-position ETT as > 5 cm above carina.
   - Continue AC ventilation with sedation
   - F/u Nutrition c/s for TF recs
   - Path report consistent with metastatic malignant melanoma
   - Appreciate IP recs
   - F/U Hem/Onc recs
   - Rad onc c/s
 currently obtaining CT abd/pelvis (? Need chest as
   well) and MR brain for staging. Will have rad onc evaluate patient
   today.
   - No Beta agonists as unlikey to reverse fixed obstruction, and may
   exacerbate Aflutter
   - Continue vanco/levofloxacin for now
   - F/U sputum cx sensitivities, blood cx
   - F/U final read CXR
   - likely transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] after IP intervention (and when clinically
   stable after intervention)
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence. Ruled out by enzymes. Remains in NSR at this time.
   - No anticoagulation or aspirin given recent intervention
   - Rate control with Diltiazem , maintain dosage to 30 mg QID and
   monitor for hypotension (increase holding parameter to 110)
   # Pneumonia
 patient appears to have LLL > RLL infiltrate and has been
   persistently febrile with leukocytosis. Xray today concerning for
   increase in infiltrate versus left pleural effusion.
   - f/u culture data
   - continue vancomycin/levofloxacin
   - check vancomycin trough and dose appropriately
   .
   #Fever:  Concerning for pulmonary infection with sputum culture
   currently growing Moraxella in conjunction with thick secretions and
   drop in O2 sats.  UA not suggestive of urinary tract infection
   Moraxella in sputum.
   -f/u blood cx
   -continue vancomycin and levaquin for possible VAP (day 4)
   # Asthma: Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoid bronchodilators as they will exacerbate atrial
   flutter.
   .
   # FEN: IVF boluses prn, replete electrolytes, TFs after Nutrion c/s

Based on the progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

* The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of locally advanced melanoma, currently intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure and mediastinal mass.
* She has a large retrotracheal mediastinal adenopathy, obstructing the left main and lower lobe bronchi, resulting in left lower lobe collapse, and large pulmonary metastases in the right upper and middle lobes.
* She has a moderate bilateral pleural effusion and is at high risk of developing further complications.
* She has atrial flutter, which is likely related to pericardial tumor involvement, and is being treated with rate control medication.
* She has a fever, which is concerning for pulmonary infection, and has a positive sputum culture for Moraxella catarhalis.
* She has a moderate amount of sputum growth, and her oxygen saturation is 99%.
* She is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and sedation, and is being monitored for fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and respiratory function.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to the large mediastinal mass and pulmonary metastases, which can lead to further decline in lung function and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
* Pneumonia, which is already suspected and needs to be monitored and treated promptly to prevent further complications.
* Atrial flutter, which can lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest if not properly managed.
* Infection, which can spread to other parts of the body and lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
* Fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and further compromise respiratory function.
* Nutritional deficiencies, which can lead to further decline in overall health and immune function.

Based on this assessment, I recommend the following:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory function and oxygen saturation closely.
* Administer antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed to treat pneumonia and other potential infections.
* Continue to manage atrial flutter with rate control medication and monitor for signs of arrhythmias.
* Monitor for signs of infection and sepsis, and adjust treatment accordingly.
* Monitor fluid balance and electrolyte levels, and adjust IV fluids and medications as needed.
* Consider transferring the patient to a higher level of care, such as a medical-surgical unit or a cardiothoracic intensive care unit, once her condition stabilizes.
* Continue to follow up with hematology-oncology and radiation oncology services to determine the best course of treatment for her underlying cancer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Respiratory
   - keep intubated pending IP intervention

   - humidified air, suction, treatment of pneumonia
   - stop maintenance fluids as patient TBB positive; consider lasix if
   still volume up
   - lighten sedation
   - check ABG today
   - Plan for OR for placement of stent to left main bronchus today
   # Mediastinal Mass: Dyspnea and weight loss likely related to this
   tumor. Unclear primary, but may be lymphoma, melanoma or lung primary.
   Given LAD, there is concern for metastatic disease. Likely will not
   tolerate extubation until definitive therapy is achieved in regards to

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old woman with a past medical history of locally advanced melanoma, who presented with dysphagia, worsening dyspnea, and was found to have a large mediastinal mass and pulmonary nodules. She is intubated and has been diagnosed with metastatic malignant melanoma. The patient's current condition is complicated by atrial flutter, pneumonia, and a large mediastinal mass causing dyspnea and weight loss.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia: The patient's persistent fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrate on X-ray suggest a pulmonary infection. Moraxella catarhalis is growing in her sputum, which may be contributing to her respiratory symptoms.
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation and use of mechanical ventilation increase her risk of developing VAP.
	* Pneumothorax: The patient's mediastinal mass may be compressing her lungs, leading to a pneumothorax.
2. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter may progress to atrial fibrillation, which can increase her risk of stroke and thromboembolic events.
	* Hypotension: The patient's use of diltiazem for rate control may lead to hypotension, especially if her blood pressure is already low.
3. Infection-Related Complications:
	* Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and pneumonia increase her risk of developing sepsis.
	* Meningitis: The patient's mediastinal mass may be compressing her brain, leading to meningitis.
4. Tumor-Related Complications:
	* Tumor progression: The patient's metastatic melanoma may continue to progress, leading to further respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
	* Tumor bleeding: The patient's tumor may bleed, leading to hemodynamic instability and respiratory compromise.
5. Other Complications:
	* Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged intubation and use of mechanical ventilation may lead to nutritional deficiencies.
	* Skin breakdown: The patient's immobility and use of compression devices may lead to skin breakdown.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The plan should include:

1. Continued mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy to manage the patient's respiratory symptoms.
2. Antibiotic therapy to treat the patient's pneumonia and prevent VAP.
3. Cardiovascular management to control the patient's atrial flutter and hypotension.
4. Tumor management, including bronchial stenting and radiation therapy.
5. Nutritional support to prevent nutritional deficiencies.
6. Skin care to prevent skin breakdown.
7. Regular monitoring of the patient's condition to detect any complications early and manage them promptly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

* The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, currently intubated and receiving XRT to shrink a large mediastinal mass compressing her airways.
* The patient has developed bilateral upper extremity edema, which may be related to potential SVC syndrome, and is being monitored with gentle diuresis.
* She has respiratory failure likely caused by the mediastinal mass, with bilateral pleural effusions and partial lung collapse.
* The patient has anemia and a decreasing HCT level, which may be due to dilutional hemolysis, bleeding, or both.
* She has atrial flutter, which has reverted to normal sinus rhythm, but is at high risk of recurrence. The need for anticoagulation is uncertain.
* The patient has wheezing likely caused by tumor airway involvement, rather than bronchospasm.
* She has no IVF, and electrolytes are being repleted.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* SVC syndrome, which can lead to respiratory distress, facial edema, and even airway compression.
* Respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
* Anemia and decreasing HCT level, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
* Atrial flutter, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, and cardiac arrest.
* Tumor airway involvement, which can lead to worsening respiratory failure and airway obstruction.
* Bleeding, which can be exacerbated by anticoagulation and lead to hemorrhagic complications.
* Infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis, which can arise from the patient's respiratory failure and immunocompromised state.

The patient's care plan includes:

* XRT to shrink the mediastinal mass and relieve airway compression.
* Invasive ventilation to manage respiratory failure.
* Gentle diuresis to manage SVC syndrome.
* Treatment with Unasyn D5/8 to cover Moraxella.
* F/u cultures to monitor for infections.
* Rate control with diltiazem to manage atrial flutter.
* Avoiding bronchodilators to prevent exacerbation of atrial flutter.
* Repletion of electrolytes and TFs.
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
* Monitoring for signs of bleeding and anemia.
* Communication with the patient and her husband regarding code status and disposition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe airway impingement. She is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. The patient has undergone a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head with and without contrast, which showed a patent superior vena cava (SVC) but clinically, she may have SVC syndrome. She has bilateral upper extremity edema, likely due to the mediastinal mass. The patient has respiratory failure, likely caused by the mediastinal mass obstructing her airways. She has also been febrile during admission, with sputum cultures growing out Moraxella.

The patient has anemia and a dropping hematocrit (HCT), which may be due to dilutional hemolysis, bleeding, or a combination of both. She has atrial flutter, which has reverted to normal sinus rhythm, but is at high risk of recurrence. The patient's expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed make it unclear whether anticoagulation is indicated. She has wheezing, likely due to tumor airway involvement, rather than bronchospasm.

The patient is receiving Unasyn, Vanc, and Fentanyl infusions, as well as midazolam and heparin sodium. She has a multi-lumen catheter inserted and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. SVC syndrome: The patient's bilateral upper extremity edema may be due to SVC syndrome, which can lead to severe consequences if left untreated.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if the mediastinal mass is not treated effectively, leading to further airway obstruction and respiratory compromise.
3. Anemia and HCT drop: The patient's anemia and dropping HCT may lead to further complications, such as bleeding and increased risk of infection.
4. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is at high risk of recurrence, and anticoagulation may be necessary to prevent stroke.
5. Infection: The patient's febrile status and presence of Moraxella in her sputum cultures increase her risk of developing a serious infection.
6. Bleeding: The patient's propensity to bleed and the presence of a mediastinal mass increase her risk of bleeding complications.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to her respiratory failure and anemia, leading to further complications.
8. VAP: The patient's presence of a multi-lumen catheter and prophylaxis for VAP increase her risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and improve her outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT this AM
   - f/u CT torso for full staging
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - f/u IP recs (if any)
   - continue invasive ventilation
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella.
   - treat with Unasyn D5/8 (had received 4 days of levofloxacin coverage)
   - XRT per above
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways. The patient is intubated and has been transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient has been diagnosed with:

1. Metastatic melanoma: The mediastinal mass is pathologically confirmed to be positive for melanoma.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely caused by the mediastinal mass obstructing her left main and left lower lobe bronchi, as well as right lower lobe bronchus obstruction and left lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.
3. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is likely caused by pericardial tumor involvement, and she is at high risk of recurrence. The patient's enzymes are normal, but it is unclear if anticoagulation is indicated due to her expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed.
4. Asthma: The patient's wheezing is likely secondary to tumor airway involvement, rather than bronchospasm.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. XRT (radiation therapy) to shrink the mediastinal mass and improve her airway function.
2. Invasive ventilation to support her respiratory function.
3. Antibiotics to treat her febrile illness, with a focus on covering Moraxella.
4. Rate control with diltiazem to manage her atrial flutter.
5. Electrolyte repletion and glycemic control to manage her nutritional needs.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if the mediastinal mass is not effectively treated or if she develops further complications.
2. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter can recur or worsen if not properly managed, leading to cardiac arrhythmias or even cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient's febrile illness can worsen or develop into a more severe infection if not properly treated.
4. Bleeding: The patient's propensity for melanoma to bleed can lead to bleeding complications, particularly if anticoagulation is not properly managed.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional needs may not be adequately met if not properly managed, leading to deficiencies or complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address her complex medical conditions and prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT this AM
   - chemo initiation today
   - f/u CT torso for full staging
   - f/u Rad Onc recs

   patent SVC but clinically she may have it
   - monitor
   - gentle diuresis with lasix, goal negative 500 cc
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella.
   - treat with Unasyn D6/8 (had received 4 days of levofloxacin coverage)
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe airway impingement. She is intubated and receiving XRT to shrink the tumor and facilitate extubation. The patient has bilateral upper extremity edema, respiratory failure, anemia, atrial flutter, and hyperglycemia. She is also experiencing wheezing, likely due to tumor airway involvement, and has a history of asthma.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **SVC Syndrome:** The patient's bilateral upper extremity edema may be due to SVC syndrome, which is a life-threatening condition that requires close monitoring and prompt treatment.
2. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the mediastinal mass obstructing her airways, which may worsen if not addressed promptly.
3. **Atrial Flutter:** The patient's atrial flutter is a high-risk condition that may recur, and anticoagulation therapy may be indicated to prevent stroke. However, the patient's expected lifespan and propensity for bleeding may complicate this decision.
4. **Anemia and HCT Drop:** The patient's anemia and HCT drop may be due to dilutional hemolysis, bleeding, or other factors, which requires prompt evaluation and treatment.
5. **Hyperglycemia:** The patient's hyperglycemia is likely due to steroid therapy and requires close monitoring to prevent complications.
6. **Pain Control:** The patient's acute pain and potential chronic pain require effective management to prevent complications and improve her quality of life.
7. **Cancer Progression:** The patient's metastatic melanoma may progress, requiring ongoing monitoring and treatment to prevent complications and improve her prognosis.
8. **Infections:** The patient's respiratory failure and mediastinal mass may increase her risk of infections, such as pneumonia, which requires prompt recognition and treatment.
9. **Cardiovascular Complications:** The patient's atrial flutter and potential SVC syndrome may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke.
10. **Nutritional Complications:** The patient's respiratory failure and anemia may increase her risk of malnutrition, which requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications.

**ICU Care:**

The patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU to address her complex medical conditions and prevent complications. This includes ongoing assessment of her respiratory status, cardiovascular function, and nutritional needs, as well as prompt recognition and treatment of any potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, intubated due to a large mediastinal mass causing severe airway impingement. She is receiving XRT to shrink the tumor and allow for extubation. The patient has several comorbidities, including bilateral upper extremity edema, respiratory failure, anemia, atrial flutter, and hyperglycemia. She is receiving various medications, including lasix, dexamethasone, midazolam, and fentanyl, and has been treated with Unasyn for a respiratory infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. SVC syndrome: The patient's bilateral upper extremity edema may be due to SVC syndrome, which could worsen if not monitored and managed properly.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the mediastinal mass obstructing her airways, which could lead to further complications if not managed properly.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to bleeding or hemolysis, which could worsen if not treated promptly.
4. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is likely due to pericardial tumor involvement, which could lead to further complications if not managed properly.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is likely due to the dexamethasone treatment, which could lead to further complications if not managed properly.
6. Infection: The patient has a respiratory infection, which could worsen if not treated promptly.
7. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding risk is increased due to her melanoma diagnosis, which could lead to further complications if not managed properly.
8. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications.
9. Respiratory arrest: The patient's respiratory failure could lead to respiratory arrest if not managed properly.
10. Cardiac arrest: The patient's atrial flutter could lead to cardiac arrest if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's SVC syndrome closely and manage it properly to prevent worsening.
2. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with invasive ventilation and consider adjusting her XRT schedule if necessary.
3. Treat the patient's anemia promptly to prevent further complications.
4. Monitor the patient's atrial flutter closely and manage it properly to prevent further complications.
5. Continue to manage the patient's hyperglycemia with insulin and monitor her glucose levels closely.
6. Treat the patient's respiratory infection promptly to prevent worsening.
7. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk closely and manage it properly to prevent further complications.
8. Monitor the patient's hypotension closely and manage it properly to prevent further complications.
9. Consider intubating the patient if her respiratory failure worsens.
10. Consider inserting a central line if the patient's hypotension worsens."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe airway impingement. She was intubated after bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for radiation therapy (XRT) to shrink the tumor and allow for extubation. The patient has been febrile during admission, with sputum cultures growing out Moraxella. She has bilateral upper extremity edema, which may be due to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, and is at risk for atrial flutter recurrence.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's mediastinal mass is causing obstruction of the left main and left lower lobe bronchi, as well as right lower lobe bronchus obstruction and left lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse. This may lead to worsening respiratory failure.
2. SVC syndrome: The patient's bilateral upper extremity edema may be due to SVC syndrome, which can lead to further edema, respiratory distress, and cardiac complications.
3. Atrial flutter recurrence: The patient's atrial flutter is likely due to pericardial tumor involvement and may recur, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and potential cardiac arrest.
4. Anemia and HCT drop: The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are dropping, which may be due to dilutional hemolysis, bleeding, or other causes. This can lead to worsening anemia, fatigue, and potential cardiac complications.
5. Infections: The patient's febrile status and presence of bilateral pleural effusions may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
6. Pain management: The patient may experience acute and chronic pain due to her condition, which can impact her quality of life and overall well-being.
7. Ineffective coping: The patient may experience psychological distress and ineffective coping mechanisms due to her diagnosis and treatment, which can impact her mental health and overall well-being.
8. Knowledge deficit: The patient may have a knowledge deficit regarding her condition, treatment options, and self-care, which can lead to decreased adherence to treatment and potential complications.
9. Pneumonia: The patient's wheezing may be due to tumor airway involvement, which can increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
10. DVT and VAP: The patient's immobility and indwelling lines may increase the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, intubated and receiving radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink a large mediastinal mass causing severe airway obstruction. The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T = 36.3°C, HR = 93 bpm, BP = 128/74 mmHg, RR = 17 inspirations per minute, SpO2 = 98%
* Respiratory support: Invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and PEEP of 10 cmH2O
* Cardiovascular status: Bradycardic with hypotension, requiring vasopressors
* Neurological status: Not assessed due to intubation
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC: 10.1 x 10^9/L
	+ Hct: 31.7%
	+ Platelet count: 520 x 10^9/L
	+ Blood chemistry: Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase, and albumin levels
* Imaging studies:
	+ CTA: Patent superior vena cava (SVC) but clinically may have SVC syndrome
	+ CT torso: Large mediastinal mass obstructing left main and left lower lobe bronchi, with bilateral pleural effusions

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory failure.
2. SVC syndrome: The patient's symptoms and imaging studies suggest the possibility of SVC syndrome, which could worsen respiratory and cardiovascular status.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's bradycardic and hypotensive episodes require close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.
4. Anemia and hemolytic anemia: The patient's anemia and falling hemoglobin levels require further evaluation and management to prevent further complications.
5. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is a concern, and anticoagulation therapy may be necessary to prevent stroke.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
7. Infection: The patient's febrile status and positive sputum culture for Moraxella require further evaluation and management to prevent sepsis and other infections.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and anemia require close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.

In summary, the patient is critically ill with metastatic melanoma, intubated and receiving radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The patient's respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological status are critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways. She is currently intubated and receiving radiation therapy (XRT) with the goal of shrinking the tumor to allow for successful extubation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.4°C, Tcurrent 36.3°C, HR 93 bpm, BP 128/74 mmHg, RR 17 inspirations per minute, SpO2 98%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving diltiazem for rate control, and an arterial line is planned for BP monitoring and ABG
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, and the plan is to continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of the left main bronchus
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC: 10.1 K/uL
	+ Hct: 31.7%
	+ Plt: 520 K/uL
	+ Cr: 0.4 mg/dL
	+ TCO2: 31 mmHg
	+ Glucose: 147 mg/dL
	+ Other labs: PT/PTT/INR 14.8/27.9/1.3, ALT/AST 20/20, Alk Phos/T Bili 141/0.2, Differential-Neuts 86.6%, Lymph 7.0%, Mono 4.6%, Eos 1.5%, Albumin 2.6 g/dL, LDH 351 IU/L, Ca++ 8.1 mg/dL, Mg++ 2.2 mg/dL, PO4 2.5 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's mediastinal mass is causing severe impingement on her airways, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
* SVC syndrome: The patient has bilateral upper extremity edema, which may be due to SVC syndrome. Monitoring and gentle diuresis with lasix may be necessary to manage this condition.
* Anemia/HCT drop: The patient's Hct is dropping, which may be due to dilutional hemolysis or bleeding. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address this condition.
* Atrial flutter: The patient has atrial flutter, which may be due to pericardial tumor involvement. Rate control with diltiazem and consideration of anticoagulation may be necessary to manage this condition.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia due to decadron. Monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications.
* DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobility and underlying medical conditions. Prophylaxis with HSQ and Pneumoboots may be necessary to prevent this complication.

In summary, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including respiratory failure, SVC syndrome, anemia/HCT drop, atrial flutter, hyperglycemia, and DVT. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and address these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour post-radiation therapy patient in the ICU, receiving chemotherapy and radiation to get off the ventilator. They have been experiencing bradycardia (50s) with hypotension (80s) while sleeping, which was managed by holding the dose of Diltiazem and administering 500cc of fluid without a change in pressure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 93bpm, and blood pressure of 128/74mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy and are intubated on a ventilator with a set tidal volume of 450mL and a respiratory rate of 14bpm.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's bradycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiac instability, and further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's intubation and ventilation may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
3. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of infection, including sepsis and multi-organ failure.
4. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage.
5. Renal failure: The patient's hypotension and decreased cardiac output may increase the risk of renal failure, especially if they are not adequately resuscitated.
6. Metabolic complications: The patient's hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia may indicate metabolic instability, and further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent metabolic complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and manage these potential complications, and a multidisciplinary approach involving ICU staff, oncologists, and other specialists is necessary to ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, intubated and receiving radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink a large mediastinal mass causing severe airway impingement. The patient has a history of respiratory failure, anemia, atrial flutter, asthma, hyperglycemia, and bilateral upper extremity edema, which may be related to SVC syndrome.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* T: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* HR: 93 bpm
* BP: 128/74 mmHg
* RR: 17 breaths/min
* SpO2: 98%

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 10.1 x 10^9/L
* Hct: 31.7%
* Plt: 520 x 10^9/L
* Cr: 0.4 mg/dL
* TCO2: 31 mmHg
* Glucose: 147 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue XRT and chemotherapy
* Monitor for improvement in tumor compression of left main bronchus
* Treat respiratory failure with Unasyn and pressure support
* Monitor for anemia and Hct drop
* Monitor for atrial flutter and potential anticoagulation
* Monitor for hyperglycemia and SVC syndrome
* Continue to monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan as necessary.

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and the plan is to continue invasive ventilation pending improvement in tumor compression of left main bronchus.
* Anemia/Hct drop: The patient's Hct is dropping, and the plan is to monitor and potentially transfuse blood products.
* Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, and the plan is to monitor and potentially anticoagulate to prevent stroke.
* SVC syndrome: The patient has bilateral upper extremity edema, which may be related to SVC syndrome. The plan is to monitor and potentially treat with diuresis.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, and the plan is to continue to monitor and potentially adjust treatment as necessary.
* Infection: The patient has a history of febrile illness and positive sputum cultures, which may indicate infection. The plan is to monitor and potentially treat with antibiotics.
* Bleeding: The patient has a history of melanoma and may be at risk for bleeding. The plan is to monitor and potentially anticoagulate to prevent bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron)
   # metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT this AM
   - chemo initiation today
   - f/u CT torso for full staging
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - f/u IP recs (if any)
   - continue invasive ventilation
   .
   # Bilateral upper extremity edema - ? SVC syndrome
 the CTA indicates
   patent SVC but clinically she may have it
   - monitor
   - gentle diuresis with lasix, goal negative 500 cc
   .
   # respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella.
   - treat with Unasyn D6/8 (had received 4 days of levofloxacin coverage)
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - f/u cultures
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 falling from 33.8
28.6
25.7. Dilutional v
   hemolysis v bleed
   - PM HCT
   - hemolysis labs
   .
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed to pericardial invovlement by tumor.   at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90
   - place A-line for BP monitoring, ABG
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron)
   # metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT this AM

 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella.
   - treat with Unasyn D6/8 (had received 4 days of levofloxacin coverage)

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications and potential concerns can be summarized:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to severe airway obstruction caused by a large mediastinal mass. The plan is to provide XRT to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation.
2. Bilateral Upper Extremity Edema: The patient may have SVC syndrome, which is suspected despite a patent SVC on CTA. The plan is to monitor and consider gentle diuresis with lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance of 500 cc.
3. Anemia/HCT Drop: The patient's HCT has fallen from 33.8 to 28.6, and it is unclear whether this is due to dilutional hemolysis, bleeding, or other factors. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and plan appropriate management.
4. A-Flutter: The patient's A-flutter is attributed to pericardial involvement by the tumor. The plan is to monitor for recurrence and consider rate control with diltiazem, with a threshold HR of 90.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has developed hyperglycemia on decadron, and further monitoring is needed to ensure glycemic control.
6. WBC Elevation: The patient's WBC count has increased, likely due to the addition of steroids (Decadron). Further monitoring is needed to ensure that the WBC count remains within normal limits.
7. Fever: The patient has been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown out Moraxella. The plan is to treat with Unasyn and continue monitoring for fever.
8. Asthma: The patient's wheezing is likely secondary to tumor airway involvement rather than bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators is recommended to prevent exacerbation of atrial flutter.
9. Pneumonia: The patient has developed bilateral pleural effusions, which may be related to the mediastinal mass or pneumonia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and plan appropriate management.

Overall, the patient remains critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of these various medical complications and potential concerns."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Contineu XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing tumor size, allowing airways
   compression release and allow lungs to reexpand and hopefuly extubate.
   Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron)
   METATSTATIC MELENONMA -- Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial empirically.
   ANEMIA
 Dilutional, bleed, ACD.  Continue serial hct.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed to pericardial invovlement by tumor.   at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.
   HYPERGLUYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

   MICU attending:
   Family meeting, with husband and 2 close family friends.  Updated
   medical condition, and answered all questions.  All understand nature
   of underlying disease.  All understand hope of reducing mediastinal
   tumor size with XRT and chemotherapy, to allow relief of extrinsic
   airway compression, and hope for possible extubation trial.  Although
   all hopeful, understand that patient may not be able to be extubated
   safely.  Express that patient would not want chronic ventilation via
   trach.  Also ,state that she is to be recussitated in the event of
   cardiac arrest, althought also express that they to not want patient to
   suffer.  Currently FULL CODE, but need to reassess based on overall
   progress.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a mediastinal mass causing central airway compression, leading to respiratory failure. She is intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/60 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99%. She is receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy to reduce the size of the mediastinal mass and alleviate airway compression.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 520 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a soft and non-tender abdomen, with bowel sounds present. Her extremities are warm and without cyanosis or clubbing.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, anemia, and atrial flutter. She is at risk for pneumonia, and antimicrobial therapy is being continued empirically. She is also at risk for stress ulcers, and prophylactic treatment with a proton pump inhibitor is being administered.

The patient's plan of care includes continued mechanical ventilation, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. She will be closely monitored for signs of respiratory failure, anemia, and atrial flutter. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be reassessed for extubation trials if her condition improves.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is primarily attributed to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression by the mediastinal mass. Further compression or obstruction could lead to worsening respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for pneumonia due to her respiratory failure and antimicrobial therapy. Pneumonia could lead to further respiratory failure and potential sepsis.
3. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is attributed to pericardial involvement by the tumor. Further progression of the tumor or cardiac involvement could lead to worsening atrial flutter and potential cardiac arrest.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is dilutional, bleed, and ACD. Further bleeding or hemolysis could worsen her anemia and lead to potential complications such as hypovolemic shock.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is attributed to the steroid medication Decadron. Further hyperglycemia could lead to potential complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, and metabolic complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Contineu XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing tumor size, allowing airways
   compression release and allow lungs to reexpand and hopefuly extubate.
   Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron)
   METATSTATIC MELENONMA -- Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial empirically.
   ANEMIA
 Dilutional, bleed, ACD.  Continue serial hct.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed to pericardial invovlement by tumor.   at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.
   HYPERGLUYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure caused by an extensive mediastinal mass compressing the airway. The patient is receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy to reduce the tumor size and alleviate airway compression. The patient has a white blood cell count elevation attributed to the addition of steroids, anemia, and atrial flutter due to pericardial involvement by the tumor. The patient also has wheezing likely secondary to tumor airway involvement, and hyperglycemia attributed to the use of decadron.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: Continued compression of the airway by the mediastinal mass may lead to further respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Pneumonia: Empirical antimicrobial therapy may not be effective against a potential pneumonia, and the patient may develop a resistant infection.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to continued bleeding or hemolysis, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter may recur, leading to cardiac arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Hyperglycemia: Uncontrolled hyperglycemia may lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, coma, or even death.
6. DVT/PE: The patient is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and the presence of central lines.
7. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis due to the presence of central lines, urinary catheter, and potential pneumonia.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient's mediastinal mass may compress the heart, leading to cardiac tamponade or cardiac failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
2. Monitor the patient's white blood cell count and adjust chemotherapy and antibiotic therapy accordingly.
3. Continue serial hemoglobin checks and transfuse blood products as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's atrial flutter and adjust medication therapy accordingly.
5. Monitor the patient's hyperglycemia and adjust insulin therapy accordingly.
6. Continue DVT prophylaxis and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medication therapy accordingly.
8. Consider repeat imaging studies to monitor the patient's tumor size and airway compression."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient, a 51-year-old female, is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation due to severe respiratory failure caused by a large mediastinal mass compressing her airways. The mass is pathologically confirmed to be melanoma. The patient is receiving radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation.

The patient has a history of metastatic melanoma and has undergone bronchoscopy. She has been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown out Moraxella. She has bilateral pleural effusions and right lower lobe bronchus obstruction.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 120/66 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on 50% FiO2.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the mediastinal mass compressing her airways. The patient may require continued invasive ventilation until the tumor is sufficiently shrunk.
2. Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which may recur due to pericardial tumor involvement. The patient's anticoagulation status is unclear, and the risk of stroke and bleeding needs to be carefully assessed.
3. Anemia/HCT drop: The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are decreasing, which may be due to dilutional hemolysis, bleeding, or other causes. The patient's HCT levels need to be closely monitored.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has been experiencing hyperglycemia, which may be related to the use of decadron. The patient's glucose levels need to be closely monitored.
5. Bilateral upper extremity edema: The patient has bilateral upper extremity edema, which may be due to SVC syndrome. The patient's CVP and electrolyte levels need to be closely monitored.
6. Infections: The patient has a history of fever and has grown out Moraxella from sputum cultures. The patient may be at risk for developing further infections.

In conclusion, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory failure, atrial flutter, anemia/HCT drop, hyperglycemia, bilateral upper extremity edema, and potential infections."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass. She was intubated after a bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to the mediastinal mass, and has been treated with Unasyn and XRT. She has also developed atrial flutter, which has been treated with rate control and anticoagulation is being considered. The patient has anemia and a dropping hemoglobin count, which is being monitored. She has bilateral upper extremity edema, which may be due to SVC syndrome, and is being treated with gentle diuresis. The patient's electrolytes are being repleted, and she is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen if the mediastinal mass is not successfully treated.
2. Atrial flutter: The patient is at high risk of recurrence of atrial flutter, and anticoagulation may be necessary to prevent stroke.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if the underlying cause is not addressed.
4. SVC syndrome: The patient's bilateral upper extremity edema may be a sign of SVC syndrome, which can lead to serious complications if not treated.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen if not properly managed.
6. Infection: The patient's febrile state and the presence of bilateral pleural effusions may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be addressed.
7. Bleeding: The patient's propensity to bleed and the presence of atrial flutter may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
8. Renal failure: The patient's electrolyte imbalance and the presence of bilateral pleural effusions may increase the risk of renal failure.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial flutter and the presence of a mediastinal mass may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size,
   allowing reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work
   towards extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron).
   Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
 Dilutional, bleed, ACD.  Continue serial hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Adjust diltiazem dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, who is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure caused by an extensive mediastinal mass compressing the central airway. The patient's condition is complicated by a range of comorbidities, including anemia, pneumonia, and hyperglycemia. She is also experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is attributed to pericardial involvement by the tumor.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and the risk of further complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is high.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a significant risk factor for stroke and other cardiovascular complications, and the risk of recurrence is high.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is a concern, particularly given the use of steroids (Decadron), which can exacerbate hyperglycemia.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is a concern, particularly given the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is a concern, particularly given the risk of further complications, such as sepsis or respiratory failure.
6. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid imbalance is a concern, particularly given the risk of cardiac failure or other complications.
7. Metastatic disease: The patient's metastatic melanoma is a significant concern, and the risk of further metastases is high.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation to support the patient's respiratory function.
2. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation closely, and adjust medications as necessary to prevent further complications.
3. Monitor the patient's hyperglycemia closely, and adjust medications as necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Monitor the patient's anemia closely, and consider transfusions as necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Continue antimicrobial therapy for the patient's pneumonia, and monitor for further complications.
6. Monitor the patient's fluid balance closely, and adjust fluids as necessary to prevent further complications.
7. Consider further imaging studies, such as a CT scan or MRI, to monitor the patient's metastatic disease and identify any potential complications.
8. Consider palliative care consultation to address the patient's symptom burden and improve quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size,
   allowing reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work
   towards extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron).
   Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
 Dilutional, bleed, ACD.  Continue serial hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Adjust diltiazem dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a mediastinal mass causing severe extrinsic compression of the airways. She is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. She has a history of pneumonia, anemia, and fluid imbalance. She is also experiencing atrial flutter and hyperglycemia. The patient is receiving XRT and chemotherapy to reduce the size of the mediastinal tumor and alleviate airway obstruction.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pneumonia:** The patient is already experiencing pneumonia, and there is a risk of further complications, such as sepsis, respiratory failure, and multi-organ dysfunction.
2. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue due to the mediastinal mass compression, and there is a risk of further deterioration, including hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
3. **Atrial Flutter:** The patient's atrial flutter is likely to continue due to the pericardial involvement by the tumor, and there is a risk of further complications, such as atrial fibrillation, flutter, and tachycardia.
4. **Hyperglycemia:** The patient's hyperglycemia is likely to continue due to the decadron, and there is a risk of further complications, such as ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic syndrome, and diabetic coma.
5. **Fluid Imbalance:** The patient's fluid imbalance is likely to continue due to the mediastinal mass compression, and there is a risk of further complications, such as cardiac failure, pulmonary edema, and renal failure.
6. **Infection:** The patient is at risk of developing further infections, such as sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections, due to the compromised immune system and the presence of invasive devices.
7. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient is at risk of developing cardiac complications, such as cardiac failure, arrhythmias, and pericarditis, due to the pericardial involvement by the tumor.
8. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient is at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, due to the chemotherapy and the presence of invasive devices.

**Plan:**

1. Continue mechanical ventilation to manage the patient's respiratory failure.
2. Continue XRT and chemotherapy to reduce the size of the mediastinal tumor and alleviate airway obstruction.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely for signs of deterioration.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely for signs of atrial flutter or fibrillation.
5. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels closely and adjust the decadron dose as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's fluid balance closely and adjust the fluid administration as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely and adjust the electrolyte administration as necessary.
8. Consider the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection.

**ICU Care:**

1. Replete the patient with fiber-rich nutrients to maintain bowel regularity.
2. Monitor the patient's glycemic control closely and adjust the insulin dose as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely and adjust the electrolyte administration as necessary.
4. Consider the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Consider the use of VAP prophylaxis to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains stable. The patient is still on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a heart rate of 87 beats per minute, blood pressure of 143/70 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 487 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the fact that the patient is intubated and sedated. The patient's skin and neurologic examination were not assessed.

The patient is at risk for potential medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, and the risk of respiratory failure persists.
2. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and the patient is at risk for developing sepsis.
3. Bloodstream infection: The patient's central venous catheter (CVC) is at risk for infection, and the patient is at risk for developing a bloodstream infection.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing a DVT due to immobility and the presence of a central venous catheter.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for developing a stress ulcer due to the presence of a central venous catheter and the patient's critical illness.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to the presence of a central venous catheter and the patient's respiratory status.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium level is slightly elevated, and the patient is at risk for developing an electrolyte imbalance.

Based on the patient's condition and the potential medical complications, the patient should continue to receive close monitoring and management in the ICU. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and the patient should be considered for extubation once their respiratory status improves. The patient's central venous catheter should be maintained in a sterile fashion, and the patient should receive prophylactic antibiotics to prevent bloodstream infections. The patient should also receive prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent DVT."

   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, 4th dose Monday [**5-19**]
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella.
   - treat with Unasyn D8/8 (had received 4 days of levofloxacin coverage)
 dc today
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - f/u cultures
   - switch to pressure support
   - may consider repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 falling from 33.8

25.7. Dilutional v
   hemolysis v bleed
   - trend HCT
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   - A-line unsuccessful
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.
   .
   #hyperglycemia on decadron
   -continue to monitor
   -last dose of decadron is [**5-18**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, 4th dose Monday [**5-19**]
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella.
   - treat with Unasyn D8/8 (had received 4 days of levofloxacin coverage)
 dc today
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - f/u cultures
   - switch to pressure support
   - may consider repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 falling from 33.8
28.6
25.7. Dilutional v
   hemolysis v bleed
   - trend HCT
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   - A-line unsuccessful
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.
   .
   #hyperglycemia on decadron
   -continue to monitor
   -last dose of decadron is [**5-18**]
   .
   # Bilateral upper extremity edema - ? SVC syndrome
 the CTA indicates
   patent SVC but clinically she may have it

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways. She is intubated and receiving invasive ventilation. The patient is currently receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy to shrink the tumor sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 87 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 143/70 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 97% on 50% FiO2.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to the mediastinal mass, which is obstructing her airways and causing bilateral pleural effusions.
2. Anemia/HCT drop: The patient's hemoglobin level is dropping, which may be due to dilutional hemolysis, bleeding, or a combination of both.
3. Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which may be related to pericardial tumor involvement. She is at high risk of recurrence and may require anticoagulation.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which may be related to her treatment with steroids.
5. Bilateral upper extremity edema: The patient has bilateral upper extremity edema, which may be related to SVC syndrome.
6. Fever: The patient has been febrile during admission, which may be related to her underlying condition or a secondary infection.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continue invasive ventilation
2. Administer chemotherapy and radiation therapy
3. Monitor and treat hyperglycemia
4. Monitor and treat anemia/HCT drop
5. Monitor and treat atrial flutter
6. Monitor and treat bilateral upper extremity edema
7. Monitor and treat fever
8. Consider repeat CT scans to monitor the progression of the mediastinal mass

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple potential medical complications. She requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size,
   allowing reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work
   towards extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron).
   Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
 Dilutional, bleed, ACD.  Continue serial hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and extensive mediastinal mass causing central airway compression, resulting in respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 129/68 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.4 g/dL, hemoglobin of 9.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 290,000/μL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L.

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, anemia, and metastatic melanoma. The patient is also at risk for pneumonia, fluid overload, and atrial flutter.

The patient's medications include midazolam, fentanyl, and ampicillin/sulbactam, which were administered for respiratory support and treatment of potential infections.

The patient's plan of care includes continued mechanical ventilation, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy to reduce the size of the mediastinal tumor and alleviate airway compression. The patient will also receive antimicrobial therapy to complete the course of treatment for pneumonia. The patient's fluid status will be closely monitored to prevent fluid overload, and the patient will receive prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prevention.

The patient's code status is full code, and the patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient's total time spent in the ICU is 45 minutes."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size,
   allowing reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work
   towards extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron).
   Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
 Dilutional, bleed, ACD.  Continue serial hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   allowing reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work
   towards extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron).
   Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
 Dilutional, bleed, ACD.  Continue serial hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, experiencing respiratory failure due to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression from a mediastinal mass. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 129/68 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 5 mmHg, and fluid balance is being closely monitored.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 9.4 g/dL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.5 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 290 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.5 mg/dL
* Total CO2 (TCO2): 34 mmHg
* Glucose: 132 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes:

* Metastatic melanoma with extensive mediastinal mass and central airway compression
* Pneumonia, being treated with antibiotics
* Anemia, attributed to dilutional, bleed, and ACD
* Fluid imbalance, being closely monitored
* Atrial flutter, attributed in part to pericardial involvement by tumor
* Asthma, likely secondary to tumor airway involvement
* Hyperglycemia, attributed to decadron

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue mechanical ventilation
* Continue XRT and chemotherapy to reduce mediastinal tumor size and alleviate airway obstruction
* Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT is complete
* Monitor WBC elevation and anemia
* Monitor fluid balance and maintain a balance between input and output
* Monitor atrial flutter and maintain a controlled rate with diltiazem
* Avoid bronchodilators due to risk of exacerbating atrial fib
* Monitor hyperglycemia and maintain a glucose level less than 150 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression
* Pneumonia, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure
* Anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues
* Fluid imbalance, which can lead to hypovolemic shock or pulmonary edema
* Atrial flutter, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output
* Hyperglycemia, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic coma, or even death."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, 4th dose Monday [**5-19**]
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella s/p eight
   day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - f/u cultures
   - switch to pressure support (daily SBT)
   - may consider repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   - A-line unsuccessful
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

   #hyperglycemia on decadron
   -continue to monitor
   -last dose of decadron is [**5-18**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, 4th dose Monday [**5-19**]
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella s/p eight
   day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - f/u cultures
   - switch to pressure support (daily SBT)
   - may consider repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   - A-line unsuccessful
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.
   .
   #hyperglycemia on decadron
   -continue to monitor
   -last dose of decadron is [**5-18**]
   .
   # Bilateral upper extremity edema - ? SVC syndrome
 the CTA indicates
   patent SVC but clinically she may have it

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways. The patient is intubated and receiving radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (98.9°F)
* Heart rate: 79 bpm (normal range 59-93 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 116/60 mmHg (normal range 73-130/46-86 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (normal range 14-19 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's lab results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 280 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 21 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.2 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.6 g/dL
* Lactate dehydrogenase: 351 IU/L

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Metastatic melanoma with a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways
* Respiratory failure due to the mediastinal mass
* Anemia and hematocrit drop
* Atrial flutter, which has reverted to normal sinus rhythm, but the patient is at high risk of recurrence
* Asthma, which is likely secondary to tumor airway involvement
* Hyperglycemia due to steroids
* Bilateral upper extremity edema, which may be due to superior vena cava syndrome

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Respiratory failure due to worsening of the mediastinal mass
* Anemia and hematocrit drop, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased immune function
* Atrial flutter, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and increased risk of stroke
* Asthma, which can exacerbate respiratory failure
* Hyperglycemia, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis and other complications
* Bilateral upper extremity edema, which can lead to SVC syndrome and other complications

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing XRT and chemotherapy to shrink the mediastinal mass
* Monitoring of vital signs and lab results
* Treatment of anemia and hematocrit drop
* Rate control with diltiazem for atrial flutter
* Avoiding bronchodilators for asthma
* Monitoring of hyperglycemia
* Monitoring of bilateral upper extremity edema and considering SVC syndrome
* Continuing invasive ventilation and pressure support ventilation
* Considering repeat CT scan to monitor progress of mediastinal mass
* F/u with hematology and oncology teams."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, 4th dose Monday [**5-19**]
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella s/p eight
   day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - f/u cultures
   - switch to pressure support (daily SBT)
   - may consider repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   - A-line unsuccessful
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways. The patient is intubated and receiving radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 37.6°C, Heart rate 79 bpm, Blood pressure 116/60 mmHg, Respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, SpO2 98%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions, and her heart rhythm is normal sinus rhythm.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,824 mL of fluids, with 547 mL of IV fluids and 275 mL of total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O.
* Laboratory results:
	+ White blood cell count (WBC): 9.0-14.2 K/uL
	+ Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.6-12.1 g/dL
	+ Platelet count (Plt): 280-365 K/uL
	+ Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 136-140 mg/dL
	+ Creatinine (Cr): 0.5-0.6 mg/dL
	+ Glucose: 114-178 mg/dL
* Imaging studies:
	+ CT scan shows a large mediastinal mass obstructing the left main and left lower lobe bronchi, as well as the right lower lobe bronchus, with bilateral pleural effusions.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may continue to deteriorate due to the mediastinal mass compressing her airways.
2. Anemia/HCT drop: The patient's anemia and HCT levels may continue to decline, potentially leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased immune function.
3. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter may recur, potentially leading to arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen, potentially leading to diabetic ketoacidosis, coma, and even death.
5. Bilateral upper extremity edema: The patient's bilateral upper extremity edema may worsen, potentially leading to decreased peripheral perfusion and increased risk of infection.
6. SVC syndrome: The patient may develop SVC syndrome, potentially leading to increased risk of respiratory and cardiac compromise.
7. Infection: The patient may develop an infection, potentially leading to sepsis and multi-organ failure.

The patient's care plan includes:

1. Continue XRT and chemotherapy to shrink the mediastinal mass.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
3. Trend the patient's HCT levels and transfuse as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's atrial flutter and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's hyperglycemia and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's bilateral upper extremity edema and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Consider repeat CT scans to monitor the patient's response to treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, 4th dose Monday [**5-19**]
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella.
   - s/p eight day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - f/u cultures
   - switch to pressure support
   - may consider repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   - A-line unsuccessful
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.
   .
   #hyperglycemia on decadron
   -continue to monitor
   -last dose of decadron is [**5-18**]
   .
   # Bilateral upper extremity edema - ? SVC syndrome

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, currently intubated and receiving radiation therapy (XRT) for a large mediastinal mass causing severe airway compression. The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with bilateral pleural effusions, and is likely related to the mediastinal mass. The patient is also experiencing anemia, atrial flutter, wheezing, hyperglycemia, and bilateral upper extremity edema, which may be related to the tumor or its treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and the mediastinal mass is causing severe airway compression. The patient may experience further respiratory decline, leading to hypoxia and hypercapnia.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial flutter may recur, and the risk of stroke or cardiac arrest is high. The patient may also experience cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure due to the tumor's involvement.
3. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient has a history of bleeding and may experience further bleeding due to the tumor's involvement or treatment.
4. Infections: The patient has a history of febrile episodes and may experience further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and further imbalance may occur due to the tumor's involvement or treatment.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is malnourished and may experience further deficiencies due to inadequate nutrition.
7. Wound complications: The patient has a history of bronchoscopy and may experience wound complications, including infection or dehiscence.
8. Central venous catheter-related complications: The patient has a central venous catheter in place and may experience complications, including catheter-related bloodstream infections or catheter malfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue XRT and chemotherapy as planned.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
3. Manage the patient's atrial flutter with rate control medications and monitor for signs of recurrence.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Provide adequate nutrition and consider enteral nutrition if the patient is unable to tolerate oral intake.
6. Monitor the patient's wound and consider wound care measures to prevent infection or dehiscence.
7. Monitor the patient's central venous catheter and consider removing it if complications occur.
8. Consider repeat CT scans to monitor the patient's tumor response to treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition and potential medical complications as follows:

**Current Condition:**

* Respiratory failure due to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression caused by a mediastinal melanoma mass
* Intubated and mechanically ventilated
* Worsening anemia
* Hyperglycemia
* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) due to steroids
* Presence of pneumonia
* Atrial flutter with normal sinus rhythm
* History of metastatic melanoma with extensive mediastinal mass

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pneumonia:** Continued antimicrobial therapy is necessary to complete the course and prevent further complications.
2. **Anemia:** Dilutional anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding and ACD. Serial hematocrit monitoring is necessary to track the patient's anemia status.
3. **Fluid Imbalance:** Fluid monitoring is crucial to maintain balance and prevent complications such as CVP elevation.
4. **Atrial Flutter:** The patient is at high risk of recurrence due to pericardial involvement by the tumor. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent arrhythmia complications.
5. **Hyperglycemia:** Tight glycemic control is necessary to prevent complications, especially with the patient's history of hyperglycemia attributed to decadron.
6. **VAP:** The patient is at risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation. Close monitoring of respiratory status and implementation of prophylactic measures are necessary.
7. **DVT:** The patient is at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and prolonged ICU stay. Prophylactic measures such as systemic anticoagulation and compression stockings should be considered.
8. **Stress Ulcer:** The patient is at risk of developing stress ulcers due to prolonged ICU stay and critical illness. Prophylactic measures such as proton pump inhibitors should be continued.
9. **Nutritional Support:** The patient's nutritional status should be closely monitored, and enteral or parenteral nutrition should be considered if necessary to prevent malnutrition.
10. **Extubation:** The patient's airway obstruction and extrinsic compression may make extubation challenging. Close monitoring of respiratory status and careful planning for extubation are necessary to prevent complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size,
   allowing reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work
   towards extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron).
   Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
 Dilutional, bleed, ACD.  Continue serial Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and extensive mediastinal mass causing central airway compression, leading to respiratory failure. She is intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of anemia, pneumonia, and asthma. She is currently receiving XRT and chemotherapy, and her plan is to reduce the mediastinal tumor size to allow for successful extubation. She has also been diagnosed with A-flutter, hyperglycemia, and wheezing.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pneumonia:** The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, and it is essential to complete the antibiotic course to prevent further complications.
2. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression. Monitoring of CXR and repeat CT scans is necessary to assess the effectiveness of XRT and chemotherapy in reducing the mediastinal tumor size.
3. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia is attributed to dilutional, bleed, and ACD. Monitoring of serial Hct is necessary to assess the effectiveness of treatment.
4. **Fluid Imbalance:** The patient's fluid balance needs to be monitored closely to prevent fluid overload or dehydration.
5. **A-Flutter:** The patient is at high risk of recurrence of A-flutter due to pericardial involvement by tumor. Close monitoring of ECG and enzymes is necessary to detect any changes.
6. **Hyperglycemia:** The patient's hyperglycemia is attributed to decadron. Monitoring of glucose levels and maintaining a level <150 is necessary.
7. **Wheezing:** The patient's wheezing is likely secondary to tumor airway involvement, and bronchodilators should be avoided to prevent exacerbation of atrial fib.
8. **Catheter-Related Complications:** The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen catheter, which increases the risk of catheter-related complications such as infection, bleeding, or catheter failure.
9. **VAP:** The patient is at risk of VAP due to her intubation status. HOB elevation, mouth care, and RSBI are necessary to prevent VAP.
10. **DVT:** The patient is at risk of DVT due to her immobility. Prophylaxis with boots and systemic anticoagulation is necessary to prevent DVT.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
2. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and adjust fluid administration accordingly.
3. Continue XRT and chemotherapy as planned, and monitor the patient's response to treatment.
4. Monitor the patient's anemia and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and maintain a level <150.
6. Monitor the patient's A-flutter and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's wheezing and avoid bronchodilators.
8. Monitor the patient's catheter-related complications and adjust treatment as necessary.
9. Monitor the patient's VAP risk and take measures to prevent VAP.
10. Monitor the patient's DVT risk and take measures to prevent DVT."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size,
   allowing reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work
   towards extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   Consider bronchoscopy to assess airway patency.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron).
   Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Stable Hct.  Continue serial Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a mediastinal mass causing central airway compression and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.5°C, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 102/54 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95% on 50% FiO2.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 433 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure, anemia, hyperglycemia, and pneumonia. The patient is also at risk for atrial flutter due to mediastinal involvement by the tumor.

The patient's plan includes continued mechanical ventilation, XRT, and chemotherapy to reduce the size of the mediastinal mass and allow for extubation. The patient's airway patency will be monitored, and bronchoscopy may be performed if necessary.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the mediastinal mass compressing the airways.
2. Atrial flutter: The patient is at risk for atrial flutter due to mediastinal involvement by the tumor, which may lead to arrhythmias and cardiac complications.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen due to the administration of steroids, which may lead to diabetic ketoacidosis.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and the presence of a central airway mass.
5. Bleeding: The patient's anemia may worsen due to bleeding complications from the mediastinal mass or other underlying conditions.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and the presence of a central airway mass.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac function may be compromised due to the mediastinal mass compressing the heart and great vessels.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of their medical conditions to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size,
   allowing reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work
   towards extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   Consider bronchoscopy to assess airway patency.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron).
   Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Stable Hct.  Continue serial Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and a mediastinal mass causing severe extrinsic compression of the airways, leading to respiratory failure. She is intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of pneumonia, anemia, and hyperglycemia. She is also experiencing tachycardia, A-flutter, and asthma-like symptoms. The patient is currently receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy to reduce the size of the mediastinal mass and alleviate airway obstruction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk of developing further respiratory infections due to her compromised immune system and prolonged intubation.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the mediastinal mass continues to compress the airways, leading to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory arrest.
3. A-flutter: The patient's A-flutter may recur despite medication, and may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and potential cardiac arrest.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias and potential cardiac arrest.
7. Asthma-like symptoms: The patient's asthma-like symptoms may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further respiratory distress and potential respiratory arrest.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to her compromised immune system and prolonged intubation.
9. Cardiac complications: The patient's mediastinal mass may cause cardiac complications such as pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, or cardiac arrest.
10. Neurological complications: The patient's mediastinal mass may cause neurological complications such as spinal cord compression, brainstem compression, or seizures.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
2. Continue chemotherapy and radiation therapy to reduce the size of the mediastinal mass and alleviate airway obstruction.
3. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels closely and adjust insulin therapy as needed to maintain a blood glucose level of <150.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely and adjust electrolyte therapy as needed to maintain normal levels.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust medication as needed to maintain a normal heart rate and rhythm.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and adjust medication as needed to manage any neurological symptoms.
7. Consider bronchoscopy to assess airway patency and monitor for signs of pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
8. Monitor the patient's fluid balance closely and adjust fluid therapy as needed to maintain a balanced fluid status.
9. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism."

   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size,
   allowing reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work
   towards extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   Consider bronchoscopy to assess airway patency.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure attributed to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression caused by a mediastinal mass. The patient is also receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy (XRT) to reduce the tumor size and alleviate airway obstruction.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), heart rate of 89 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 102/54 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95%, and the arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.30, pCO2 of 30 mmHg, and pO2 of 60 mmHg.

The patient has a white blood cell count of 9.0 x 10^9/L, and the results of other laboratory tests, including complete blood count (CBC), electrolyte panel, and liver function tests (LFTs), are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a soft, non-tender abdomen, and the patient is able to follow simple commands and respond to verbal stimuli. The patient's skin is warm, and there is no evidence of cyanosis or clubbing.

The patient's medical history is significant for metastatic melanoma, and the patient is currently receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the mediastinal mass continues to compress the airways, and the patient may require more aggressive interventions, such as tracheostomy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Pneumonia: The patient's antimicrobial therapy may not be effective in treating pneumonia, and the patient may require more aggressive treatment, such as bronchoscopy or surgical intervention.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if the patient's blood loss is not adequately replaced, and the patient may require transfusions or other interventions to manage anemia.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload may worsen if the patient's fluid balance is not carefully monitored, and the patient may require more aggressive diuretic therapy or other interventions to manage fluid overload.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if the patient's underlying condition is not managed, and the patient may require more aggressive anticoagulation therapy or other interventions to manage atrial fibrillation.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen if the patient's glucose levels are not carefully monitored, and the patient may require more aggressive insulin therapy or other interventions to manage hyperglycemia.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic status. The patient's code status should be reviewed and updated as necessary, and the patient's family should be informed of the patient's condition and potential outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, intubated and receiving XRT and chemo for a large mediastinal mass causing severe airway compression. The patient has been febrile during admission, with sputum cultures growing out Moraxella after an 8-day treatment with Levo/Unasyn. The patient has respiratory failure likely due to the mediastinal mass, which is obstructing left main and left lower lobe bronchi, and has bilateral pleural effusions. The patient has anemia, with a stable hemoglobin level, and atrial flutter, which has reverted to normal sinus rhythm but is at high risk of recurrence.

The patient has hyperglycemia, which is being monitored, and has bilateral upper extremity edema, which may be due to SVC syndrome. The patient is receiving XRT and chemo, and the plan is to continue invasive ventilation until the tumor compression of the left main bronchus improves.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen due to the mediastinal mass compression, leading to increased oxygen requirements and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's febrile status and bilateral pleural effusions increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
3. Bleeding: The patient's atrial flutter and potential SVC syndrome increase the risk of bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia can worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, or even death.
5. SVC syndrome: The patient's bilateral upper extremity edema may be due to SVC syndrome, which can lead to respiratory distress, hypotension, and even death if not managed promptly.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial flutter and potential SVC syndrome increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and even cardiac arrest.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure the best possible outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size,
   allowing reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work
   towards extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   Consider bronchoscopy to assess airway patency.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron).
   Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Stable Hct.  Continue serial Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and extensive mediastinal mass with central airway compression, leading to respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure of 101/52 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 450 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.4 x 10^9/L, a hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, and a platelet count of 68 x 10^9/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are normal, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for metastatic melanoma, and the patient is currently receiving radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The patient's tumor is causing extrinsic compression of the airways, leading to respiratory failure.

The patient's plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and radiation therapy with the goal of reducing the size of the mediastinal mass and allowing for extubation. The patient will also continue to receive chemotherapy and antibiotics as needed.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient is at risk for respiratory failure if the mediastinal mass compresses the airways further.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of a foreign body in the airway.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 8.9 g/dL, which is below the normal range. The patient is at risk for developing anemia if the patient's blood loss is not adequately replaced.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is at risk due to the patient's fluid loss and the presence of a foreign body in the airway.
5. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is a potential complication of the patient's tumor involvement. The patient is at risk for developing atrial fibrillation if the patient's tumor grows further.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, and the patient is at risk for developing hyperglycemia if the patient's insulin levels are not adequately controlled.
7. Wound infection: The patient's wound is at risk for infection due to the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of a foreign body in the airway.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure due to a mediastinal mass compressing the airways. The patient's plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and radiation therapy with the goal of reducing the size of the mediastinal mass and allowing for extubation. The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including respiratory failure, pneumonia, anemia, fluid overload, atrial flutter, hyperglycemia, and wound infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT
   and chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size,
   allowing reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work
   towards extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   Consider bronchoscopy to assess airway patency.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed to addition of steroids (Decadron).
   Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Stable Hct.  Continue serial Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The primary concern is the airway obstruction caused by the mediastinal mass, which is compressing the trachea.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/52 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 93%. The patient is receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 6.2 to 15.2 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit (Hct) ranging from 25.7 to 30.6%
* Platelet count (Plt) ranging from 433 to 527 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr) ranging from 0.4 to 0.5 mg/dL
* Total CO2 (TCO2) ranging from 35 to 40 mmHg
* Glucose ranging from 96 to 175 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Respiratory failure due to airway obstruction
* Metastatic melanoma with mediastinal mass
* Pneumonia
* Anemia
* Fluid imbalance
* Tachycardia
* A-flutter
* Asthma (wheezing likely secondary to tumor airway involvement)
* Hyperglycemia

The patient is receiving treatment for her conditions, including:

* Mechanical ventilation
* Chemotherapy and radiation therapy (XRT) for the mediastinal mass
* Antibiotics for pneumonia
* Blood transfusions for anemia
* Fluid management to maintain balance
* Medications for tachycardia, A-flutter, and hyperglycemia

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management in the ICU. The primary goal is to reduce the size of the mediastinal mass to alleviate the airway obstruction and allow for extubation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, currently intubated and receiving radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink a large mediastinal mass impinging on her airways. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, anemia, atrial flutter, hyperglycemia, and bilateral upper extremity edema, which may be related to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: Prolonged intubation, increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential for lung damage from radiation therapy.
2. Anemia: Increased risk of bleeding, hypovolemic shock, and potential need for blood transfusions.
3. Atrial flutter: Increased risk of stroke, cardiac arrhythmias, and potential need for anticoagulation therapy.
4. Hyperglycemia: Increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, and potential need for insulin therapy.
5. Bilateral upper extremity edema: Increased risk of SVC syndrome, cardiac tamponade, and potential need for urgent intervention to alleviate pressure on the superior vena cava.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. XRT to shrink the mediastinal mass and improve airway patency.
2. Chemotherapy to treat the metastatic melanoma.
3. Invasive ventilation to manage respiratory failure.
4. Monitoring of anemia, with transfusions as needed.
5. Management of atrial flutter, including rate control with diltiazem and consideration of anticoagulation therapy.
6. Monitoring of hyperglycemia, with adjustments to insulin therapy as needed.
7. Monitoring of bilateral upper extremity edema, with consideration of SVC syndrome and potential need for urgent intervention.

The patient's disposition remains in the ICU pending clinical improvement, with a code status of full code and a plan for continued invasive ventilation, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways. She was intubated and transferred to the ICU for XRT and chemo to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation. She has undergone radiation therapy and chemotherapy, with the next dose of radiation scheduled for today.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with invasive ventilation in place. She has bilateral pleural effusions and partial collapse of the left lower lobe and right lower lobe. She has been febrile during admission, with sputum cultures growing out Moraxella, and has been treated with Levo/Unasyn.

The patient's anemia is stable, with a current HCT of 23.8%. She has received a gentle bolus of blood products and is being transfused to maintain a HCT >23.

The patient has atrial flutter, which is likely related to pericardial tumor involvement. She has been treated with diltiazem for rate control, and anticoagulation is being considered.

The patient has hyperglycemia, which is being monitored and managed. She has bilateral upper extremity edema, which may be related to SVC syndrome, and is being monitored.

The patient's electrolytes are being repleted, and she is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. Her code status is full, and she is being followed by the hematology/oncology and cutaneous malignancy teams.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is at risk of further deterioration due to her mediastinal mass and pleural effusions.
2. Atrial flutter: The patient is at risk of recurrence of atrial flutter, and anticoagulation may be necessary to prevent stroke.
3. SVC syndrome: The patient's bilateral upper extremity edema may be related to SVC syndrome, which can be a life-threatening complication.
4. Infection: The patient has been febrile during admission, and her sputum cultures have grown out Moraxella, which may indicate a bacterial infection.
5. Bleeding: The patient's melanoma is at risk of bleeding, particularly with anticoagulation therapy.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen if not managed properly, and may increase her risk of complications.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly, and may increase her risk of complications.

Overall, the patient's health progress in the ICU is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Bronchoscopy yesterday disclosed evidence for
   airway patency in right and left mainstem (improved) -- trachea not
   evaluated.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT and
   chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size, allowing
   reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work towards
   extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed in part to addition of steroids
   (Decadron).  Resolved.  Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Falling  Hct (in addition to wBC and plts) --> may be in
   part related to chemotherapy.  Monitor stool guiac.  Continue serial
   Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a mediastinal mass causing severe extrinsic compression of the airways, leading to respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has been receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy to shrink the tumor, with the goal of reducing the extrinsic airway compression and allowing for extubation. She has also been experiencing anemia, WBC elevation, and hyperglycemia, which are likely related to the chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is primarily attributed to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression caused by the mediastinal mass. If the tumor continues to grow or compress the airways, the patient may experience further respiratory deterioration, including increased work of breathing, hypoxia, and hypercapnia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been receiving antibiotics to complete a course of treatment for pneumonia. However, if the infection is not fully cleared, the patient may experience worsening pneumonia, leading to respiratory failure, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to the chemotherapy and radiation therapy. If the anemia is not adequately managed, the patient may experience fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased tolerance to medical therapy.
4. WBC Elevation: The patient's WBC elevation is likely related to the addition of steroids to her treatment regimen. If the WBC elevation is not monitored and managed, the patient may experience increased risk of infection, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is likely related to the decadron used to treat her asthma. If the hyperglycemia is not adequately managed, the patient may experience increased risk of complications, including diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, and increased risk of infection.
6. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is likely related to the pericardial involvement by the tumor. If the atrial flutter is not adequately managed, the patient may experience increased risk of stroke, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac failure.
7. ICU-Associated Complications: The patient is at risk for ICU-associated complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-associated bloodstream infection, and pressure ulcers.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her respiratory status, anemia, WBC elevation, hyperglycemia, atrial flutter, and ICU-associated complications. The patient's treatment plan should be tailored to address these potential complications and optimize her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Bronchoscopy yesterday disclosed evidence for
   airway patency in right and left mainstem (improved) -- trachea not
   evaluated.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT and
   chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size, allowing
   reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work towards
   extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed in part to addition of steroids
   (Decadron).  Resolved.  Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Falling  Hct (in addition to wBC and plts) --> may be in
   part related to chemotherapy.  Monitor stool guiac.  Continue serial
   Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and extensive mediastinal mass causing central airway compression. She is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 113/64 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 97% on 40% FiO2. Her respiratory rate is 11 inspirations per minute, and her PaO2 is 33 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level.

The patient's radiology results show a mediastinal mass compressing the trachea and mainstem bronchi, which is causing her respiratory failure.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Continue mechanical ventilation to maintain airway patency and oxygenation
* Continue XRT and chemotherapy to reduce the size of the mediastinal tumor and alleviate extrinsic airway compression
* Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT is complete to assess the effectiveness of treatment
* Continue antimicrobial therapy to complete the course of treatment for pneumonia
* Monitor stool guaiac to assess for gastrointestinal bleeding
* Continue serial Hct to monitor anemia
* Monitor CVP and I/O to maintain fluid balance
* Plan to maintain a controlled rate on diltiazem to prevent atrial fibrillation
* Avoid bronchodilators to prevent exacerbation of atrial fibrillation
* Monitor glucose levels to maintain a level of less than 150 mg/dL

The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

* Respiratory failure due to continued airway compression
* Pneumonia due to ongoing antimicrobial therapy
* Anemia due to chemotherapy
* Thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy
* Atrial fibrillation due to mediastinal tumor involvement
* Hyperglycemia due to decadron
* Fluid imbalance due to ongoing fluid management

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: replete with fiber and glycemic control
* Lines: multi-lumen
* Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Communication: code status is full code, and the patient is critically ill

The patient's MICU attending has noted that the patient is critically ill and has a low threshold for reintubation if clinical decline occurs."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Bronchoscopy yesterday disclosed evidence for
   airway patency in right and left mainstem (improved) -- trachea not
   evaluated.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT and
   chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size, allowing
   reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work towards
   extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed in part to addition of steroids
   (Decadron).  Resolved.  Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Falling  Hct (in addition to wBC and plts) --> may be in
   part related to chemotherapy.  Monitor stool guiac.  Continue serial
   Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, who is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU due to respiratory failure caused by airway obstruction and extrinsic compression from a mediastinal mass.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
* Heart rate: 93 bpm (normal range: 80-101 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 113/64 mmHg (normal range: 76-121/64 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 11 inspirations per minute (normal range: 11-19 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 97% (normal range: 95-100%)
* SpO2: 97% (normal range: 95-100%)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 14.2 K/uL (normal range: 4.5-11.0 K/uL)
* Hematocrit: 23.0% (normal range: 37-52%)
* Platelet count: 311 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.2 mg/dL)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 15 mg/dL (normal range: 7-20 mg/dL)
* Electrolyte levels: normal

The patient's medication list includes:

* Fentanyl (concentrate) 75 mcg/hour
* Midazolam (Versed) 1 mg/hour
* Insulin (Humalog)
* Decadron (steroids)
* Diltiazem (to control atrial flutter)

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue mechanical ventilation
* Continue XRT and chemotherapy to reduce mediastinal tumor size and alleviate airway obstruction
* Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT is complete
* Monitor WBC and platelet counts
* Continue antimicrobial therapy to complete course
* Monitor stool guaiac and serial Hct to monitor anemia
* Monitor CVP and I/O to maintain fluid balance
* Control atrial flutter with diltiazem

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pneumonia: due to continued antimicrobial therapy
* Anemia: due to chemotherapy and falling Hct
* Fluid overload: due to excessive fluid administration
* Tachycardia: due to mediastinal involvement by tumor
* Atrial flutter: due to pericardial involvement by tumor
* Hyperglycemia: due to decadron
* Worsening respiratory failure: due to continued airway obstruction and extrinsic compression

s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for

   - XRT plan for 10 doses, 8th dose today
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation, will try to extubate soon
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella s/p eight
   day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - given new infiltrate on CXR, will resent cultures and get diff on cbc
   - switch to pressure support (daily SBT)
   - may consider repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   - gental bolus
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   - A-line unsuccessful
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways. She was intubated after bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for XRT and chemo to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation. She had an unplanned extubation and was re-intubated due to respiratory distress. She is currently receiving invasive ventilation, and her respiratory status is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the mediastinal mass compressing her airways. The risk of respiratory failure is high, and close monitoring of her respiratory status is necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been febrile during admission, and new infiltrate on CXR suggests the possibility of pneumonia. Cultures and diff on cbc should be sent to rule out infection.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent complications.
4. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is likely due to pericardial tumor involvement. Close monitoring of her cardiac status is necessary, and anticoagulation therapy may be considered.
5. SVC Syndrome: The patient's bilateral upper extremity edema may be due to SVC syndrome. Close monitoring of her I/Os and edema is necessary to prevent complications.
6. Anemia/HCT Drop: The patient's anemia and HCT drop are stable, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent further drops.
7. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU increases her risk of developing pressure ulcers. Close monitoring of her skin integrity is necessary to prevent complications.
8. Infection: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and invasive lines increase her risk of developing infections. Close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to prevent complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring of her respiratory, cardiac, and metabolic status is necessary to prevent complications and ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, 9th dose today, consider trach for the
   patient.
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation, will try to extubate soon
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella s/p eight
   day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - given new infiltrate on CXR, will resent cultures and get diff on cbc
   - switch to pressure support (daily SBT)
   - may consider repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   - gental bolus
 watch in and out, A Line may be considered.
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.
   .
   #hyperglycemia on decadron
   -continue to monitor
   -last dose of decadron is [**5-18**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways. She was intubated after a bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy. The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, with an unplanned extubation and re-intubation due to tachypnea and respiratory distress.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, and propofol for sedation and pain management. She has also been receiving antibiotics for a suspected pneumonia, and her blood glucose levels have been monitored and managed.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL, and a white blood cell count of 12.1 K/uL. Her platelet count is 487 K/uL, and her liver function tests are slightly elevated. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may be at risk for further respiratory failure due to her mediastinal mass and potential pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows a new infiltrate, and she has been febrile during her admission. She may be at risk for developing a more severe pneumonia.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia is not well-controlled, and she may be at risk for further complications, such as heart failure or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is likely related to her pericardial tumor involvement, and she may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as atrial fibrillation or cardiac arrest.
5. SVC syndrome: The patient's bilateral upper extremity edema may be related to a superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, which could be caused by her mediastinal mass.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels have been monitored and managed, but she may be at risk for further hyperglycemic episodes, especially if she continues to receive corticosteroids.
7. Bleeding: The patient's melanoma is known to have a high risk of bleeding, and she may be at risk for bleeding complications, especially if she develops further anemia or coagulopathy.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider adjusting her ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust her insulin regimen as needed.
3. Consider repeating her chest X-ray to monitor for any changes in her pneumonia.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusing her if her hemoglobin level drops below 7 g/dL.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial flutter and consider adjusting her medication regimen as needed.
6. Consider repeating her SVC ultrasound to monitor for any changes in her SVC syndrome.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medication regimen as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, should get 9th dose today (touch base with rad
   onc), consider trach for the patient.
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation, will try to extubate soon
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella s/p eight
   day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - given new infiltrate on CXR, will resent cultures and get diff on cbc
   - switch to pressure support (daily SBT)
   - repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   - gental bolus
 watch in and out, A Line may be considered.
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

   #hyperglycemia on decadron
   -continue to monitor
   -last dose of decadron is [**5-18**]

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe airway impingement. The patient was intubated and received bronchoscopy on May 9th, followed by transfer to the ICU for radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor.

The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure, likely due to the mediastinal mass obstructing left main and left lower lobe bronchi, as well as right lower lobe bronchus obstruction and left lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse. The patient has been febrile during admission, with sputum cultures growing out Moraxella after an 8-day treatment with Levo/Unasyn.

The patient's anemia and HCT drop have been stable, with a goal HCT of >23. The patient has atrial flutter, which is likely due to pericardial tumor involvement, and has been treated with rate control using diltiazem.

The patient has also developed wheezing, which is likely secondary to tumor airway involvement rather than bronchospasm. The patient has been experiencing hyperglycemia, which is being monitored, and has bilateral upper extremity edema, which may be due to SVC syndrome.

The patient's medication regimen includes infusions of fentanyl, midazolam, and propofol, as well as oral medications such as diltiazem and decadron. The patient is receiving XRT, chemotherapy, and invasive ventilation, with plans to try to extubate soon.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial flutter and potential SVC syndrome increase the risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and heart failure.
3. Bleeding: The patient's history of melanoma and potential tumor involvement of the pericardium increase the risk of bleeding, particularly with anticoagulation therapy.
4. Infections: The patient's febrile state and respiratory compromise increase the risk of infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of hyperglycemia and potential gastrointestinal compromise increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, including diarrhea and constipation.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and potential respiratory compromise increase the risk of neurological complications, including seizures and brain herniation.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address these potential complications and improve her respiratory and overall condition."

   of the services provided in her care.  I have reviewed Dr [**First Name (STitle) 7709**]
s note
   above and largely agree with his findings and plan of care.  I would
   add the following.  The patient has a most impressive chest CT scan,
   with a huge mediastinal mass, biopsy confirmed to be metstatic
   melanoma, compressing the left atrium and pulmonary veins, totally
   occluding her left mainstem, and very severely narrowing all her right
   sided airways as well.  Her exam today is consistent with severe airway
   narrowing and very prolonged expiratory times and loud rhonchi.
   Without very significant improvement in CT/bronch findings with
   completion of XRT, I do not see how she can be reasonably considered a
   candidate for extubation. Given the overall prognosis, our primary goal
   should be to avoid the extreme discomfort of asphyxiation.  For the
   time being I would continue to treat aggressively, even adding abx if
   febrile or leukocytotic.  However if repeat CT or bronch is not much
   better, I would personally advise CMO while still in ICU and on vent
   and initiate terminal wean. Thus right now SBT
s and consideration of
   trache are, for me, are not being considered.  I understand Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   had spoken with family, and I stand ready to do so also over the next
   couple of days.  Right now, fortunately, the patient is quite
   comfortable on the vent.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, should get 9th dose today (touch base with rad
   onc), consider trach for the patient.
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation, will try to extubate soon
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella s/p eight
   day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - given new infiltrate on CXR, will resent cultures and get diff on cbc
   - switch to pressure support (daily SBT)
   - repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   - gental bolus
 watch in and out, A Line may be considered.
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, intubated and receiving invasive ventilation due to severe airway compression caused by a large mediastinal mass. The patient had an unplanned extubation, which was re-intubated due to respiratory distress. The patient is receiving XRT and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and improve airway patency. The patient has been febrile during admission and has grown out Moraxella on sputum cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's airway compression and respiratory distress pose a high risk of respiratory failure, which could lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and even cardiac arrest.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's febrile state and respiratory distress increase the risk of developing pneumonia, which could worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Atrial flutter: The patient's history of atrial flutter and the presence of a pericardial tumor increase the risk of recurrent atrial flutter, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of hyperglycemia and the use of corticosteroids increase the risk of developing hyperglycemia, which could lead to diabetic ketoacidosis and other complications.
5. SVC syndrome: The patient's bilateral upper extremity edema and the presence of a mediastinal mass increase the risk of SVC syndrome, which could lead to cardiac tamponade and decreased cardiac output.
6. Bleeding: The patient's history of melanoma and the use of anticoagulation therapy increase the risk of bleeding, which could lead to life-threatening complications.
7. Infection: The patient's febrile state and respiratory distress increase the risk of developing infections, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current condition is stable, but the potential medical complications listed above pose a significant risk to the patient's health. The plan of care should focus on managing these risks and improving the patient's respiratory function. The patient should continue to receive invasive ventilation and respiratory support, and the team should closely monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as necessary. The patient should also continue to receive XRT and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and improve airway patency."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, intubated, and receiving XRT and chemo for a large mediastinal mass causing severe airway impingement. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, anemia, and atrial flutter.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 103/51 mmHg. The patient is receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions for pain and sedation.

The patient's respiratory support includes invasive ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, with a set tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 10.3-7.8 K/uL
* Hct: 27.7-25.4%
* Platelet count: 433-378 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.4-0.5 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 34-35 mmHg
* Glucose: 116-131 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes metastatic melanoma, and the patient is receiving XRT and chemo for the mediastinal mass. The patient has also had bronchoscopy and has been transferred to the ICU for respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and the mediastinal mass is causing severe airway impingement. If the patient's condition does not improve, terminal extubation may be discussed with the family and patient.
2. Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which is likely caused by pericardial tumor involvement. The patient is at high risk of recurrence, and anticoagulation may be considered.
3. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia, and transfusion goals are to maintain a hemoglobin level greater than 23%.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has been experiencing hyperglycemia, and the last dose of decadron was on [**5-18**]. The patient's blood glucose levels should be closely monitored.
5. Bilateral upper extremity edema: The patient may have SVC syndrome, and the CTA indicates a patent SVC. The patient's edema and I/Os should be closely monitored.
6. Infections: The patient has been febrile during admission, and sputum cultures have grown out Moraxella. The patient should be closely monitored for signs of infection.
7. Bleeding: The patient has a history of melanoma and is at risk of bleeding. The patient's platelet count should be closely monitored.

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill with metastatic melanoma, respiratory failure, anemia, and atrial flutter. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 103/51 mmHg. Her respiratory status is also stable, with a PEEP of 8 cmH2O and FiO2 of 70%. She is receiving invasive ventilation and has a SpO2 of 95%.

The patient has a white blood cell count of 10.3 K/μL, hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 433 K/μL. Her liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an ALT of 20 IU/L and AST of 18 IU/L. Her electrolyte levels are normal, with a sodium of 135 mmol/L, potassium of 4.0 mmol/L, and chloride of 102 mmol/L.

The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which has been treated with diltiazem. She also has a history of hyperglycemia, which is being monitored. Her bilateral upper extremity edema is being monitored, and she has been diagnosed with probable SVC syndrome.

The patient's medical plan includes continued invasive ventilation, XRT, and chemotherapy. She will be re-evaluated with a CT scan to assess the effectiveness of treatment. If the patient does not show improvement, terminal extubation will be discussed with her family.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is at risk of further deterioration if the tumor continues to compress her airways.
2. Bleeding: The patient's history of melanoma and atrial flutter increases her risk of bleeding.
3. Infection: The patient's febrile status and presence of bilateral pleural effusions increase her risk of infection.
4. SVC syndrome: The patient's bilateral upper extremity edema is being monitored, and she may require further treatment to manage this condition.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's history of hyperglycemia on decadron increases her risk of developing hyperglycemia again.
6. Atrial flutter: The patient's history of atrial flutter increases her risk of developing further arrhythmias.
7. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL increases her risk of developing anemia.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count of 433 K/μL increases her risk of developing thrombocytopenia.

Overall, the patient is at high risk of developing various medical complications due to her underlying condition and treatment. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient has been receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation, respectively.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 94 beats per minute, blood pressure of 103/51 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The oxygen saturation is 95%.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 10.3 K/μL, with a normal platelet count of 433 K/μL. The liver function tests (LFTs) are within normal limits, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 20 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 18 IU/L. The creatinine level is 0.4 mg/dL, and the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 34 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history is significant for melanoma, for which he is receiving treatment. He also has a history of atrial flutter and respiratory failure.

The patient's ICU care includes repletion with fiber, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever of unknown origin (FUO) and elevated white blood cell count may indicate the presence of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 95%. This may indicate respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia and acidosis.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count may indicate the presence of an infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
4. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is normal, but his creatinine level is elevated. This may indicate the presence of bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock.
5. Organ dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are within normal limits, but his creatinine level is elevated. This may indicate the presence of organ dysfunction, which can lead to multi-organ failure.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, including sepsis, respiratory failure, infection, bleeding, and organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways. She was intubated after a bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for initiation of radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and allow for extubation. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to the mediastinal mass, and has been febrile during admission with sputum cultures growing out Moraxella. She has also developed atrial flutter, which has reverted to normal sinus rhythm, and has anemia and hypothermia.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C
* Heart rate: 94 bpm
* Blood pressure: 103/51 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 95%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.3 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 433 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 116 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.7 g/dL
* LDH: 255 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 1.8 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the mediastinal mass compressing her airways. If the mass does not improve with XRT, the patient may require terminal extubation.
2. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is likely due to pericardial tumor involvement. She is at high risk of recurrence and may require anticoagulation therapy.
3. Anemia and hypothermia: The patient's anemia and hypothermia may be due to chronic disease and malnutrition. She may require blood transfusions and nutritional support.
4. Bilateral upper extremity edema: The patient may have SVC syndrome, which is a potential complication of mediastinal mass compression. She may require monitoring of edema and I/Os.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may be due to steroid therapy. She may require monitoring and treatment to prevent complications.
6. Infection: The patient's febrile status and positive sputum cultures suggest a potential infection. She may require antibiotic therapy and monitoring for sepsis.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's current condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and treatment to prevent complications. The plan is to continue XRT and chemotherapy, and to monitor her respiratory status and atrial flutter. She may require blood transfusions and nutritional support, and may require anticoagulation therapy to prevent stroke. The patient's family should be educated on her condition and the potential complications, and should be involved in decision-making regarding her care."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, should get 9th dose today (touch base with rad
   onc), consider trach for the patient.
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation, will try to extubate soon
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella s/p eight
   day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - given new infiltrate on CXR, will resent cultures and get diff on cbc
   - switch to pressure support (daily SBT)
   - repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   - gental bolus

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined Mrs [**Known lastname 11723**] and I was present for the key
   portion of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note
   above and largely agree with his findings and plan of care.  The
   patient had an episode of agitation last night that threatened another
   self extubation. Hence she is more significantly  sedated and
   comfortable on the vent today. Exam still has prolonged exhalation
   phase and diffuse rhonchi.   As per my note yesterday, I believe we
   need to await her 2 remaining XRT treatments and then re image with CT
   (not on PEEP or just a small amount
 such as PSV 5/0).  Repeat bronch
   may also be necessary.  If no major improvement in large airway caliber
   is seen (on no or low level vent support) then CMO strategy would be
   clearly needed.  For now I would keep her relatively heavily sedated
   and minimize interventions for now.
   40min spent in the care of this critically ill patient.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined Mrs [**Known lastname 11723**] and I was present for the key
   portion of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note
   above and largely agree with his findings and plan of care.  The
   patient had an episode of agitation last night that threatened another
   self extubation. Hence she is more significantly  sedated and
   comfortable on the vent today. Exam still has prolonged exhalation
   phase and diffuse rhonchi.   As per my note yesterday, I believe we
   need to await her 2 remaining XRT treatments and then re image with CT
   (not on PEEP or just a small amount
 such as PSV 5/0).  Repeat bronch
   may also be necessary.  If no major improvement in large airway caliber
   is seen (on no or low level vent support) then CMO strategy would be
   clearly needed.  For now I would keep her relatively heavily sedated
   and minimize interventions for now.
   40min spent in the care of this critically ill patient.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways. She was intubated after a bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for XRT and chemotherapy.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.9°F)
* Heart rate: 94 bpm (82-146 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 103/49 mmHg (61-138/83 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Not assessed
* Fluid balance: 1,957 mL (total in) and 960 mL (total out) over the past 24 hours

The patient has been receiving invasive ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 50 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 170 mmHg, and a bicarbonate level of 34 mmol/L.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.3 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 378 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 34 mg/dL
* Glucose: 116 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: Na+: 141 mmol/L, K+: 4.0 mmol/L, Cl-: 102 mmol/L, Ca2+: 7.6 mg/dL, Mg2+: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 1.8 mg/dL

The patient's diagnosis includes metastatic melanoma, respiratory failure, anemia, atrial flutter, asthma, hyperglycemia, and bilateral upper extremity edema. She is receiving XRT and chemotherapy for her melanoma, and her plan is to provide 10 doses of XRT, with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require continued invasive ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory decline, pneumonia, or ventilator-associated lung injury.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 8.1 g/dL, which is low. She may require further transfusions to maintain a safe hemoglobin level.
3. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is likely due to pericardial tumor involvement. There is a risk of recurrent atrial flutter, and she may require anticoagulation therapy to prevent stroke.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is 116 mg/dL, which is high. She may require further monitoring and treatment to maintain a safe glucose level.
5. Bilateral upper extremity edema: The patient's edema may be due to superior vena cava syndrome. Further monitoring and treatment may be necessary to manage this condition.
6. Infection: The patient has been febrile during her admission, and she may be at risk of developing a nosocomial infection.
7. Bleeding: The patient has a history of melanoma, which is known to bleed. She may be at risk of bleeding complications, particularly if she requires anticoagulation therapy.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address her multiple medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, should get 9th dose today (touch base with rad
   onc), consider trach for the patient.
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - continue invasive ventilation, will try to extubate soon
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  Mass is shown on CT to be obstructing left main and left lower
   lobe bronchi. Also with right lower lobe bronchus obstruction, and left
   lower lobe and partial right lower lobe collapse.  Of note, bilateral
   pleural effusions are also present.  The patient has been febrile
   during admission; sputum cx thus far have grown out Moraxella s/p eight
   day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT per above
   - continue vent pending improvement in tumor compression of left main
   bronchus
   - given new infiltrate on CXR, will resent cultures and get diff on cbc
   - switch to pressure support (daily SBT)
   - repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - unclear if anticoagulation is indicated in this patient given
   expected lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma
   to bleed
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   - gental bolus
 watch in and out, A Line may be considered.
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.
   .
   #hyperglycemia on decadron
   -continue to monitor
   -last dose of decadron is [**5-18**]

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications:

**Patient Information:**

* Patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways.
* She was intubated after bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for XRT and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation.

**Current Status:**

* The patient is still intubated and receiving invasive ventilation.
* Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 103/49 mmHg.
* Her oxygen saturation is 97% on 70% FiO2.
* Her respiratory support includes a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, with a set Vt of 450 mL and RR of 14.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pneumonia:** The patient has a new infiltrate on CXR, which may indicate pneumonia. Cultures and a differential count on the CBC should be sent to monitor for infection.
2. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to the mediastinal mass compressing her left main bronchus. XRT and chemotherapy may help shrink the tumor and improve her respiratory status.
3. **Anemia/HCT Drop:** The patient's HCT is stable, but her platelet count is low. Transfusions may be necessary to maintain a HCT above 23.
4. **Atrial Flutter:** The patient's atrial flutter may recur, and anticoagulation may be indicated to prevent stroke. However, the patient's expected lifespan and propensity for bleeding may make anticoagulation a risk.
5. **Bilateral Upper Extremity Edema:** The patient's edema may be due to SVC syndrome, which could be caused by the mediastinal mass. Monitoring her I/Os and edema is crucial to prevent complications.
6. **Hyperglycemia:** The patient's hyperglycemia may be due to the steroid decadron. Monitoring her glucose levels and adjusting her treatment as necessary is important to prevent complications.
7. **VAP:** The patient's invasive ventilation may increase her risk of VAP. Prophylactic measures, such as changing her endotracheal tube and using sterile technique, should be taken to prevent VAP.

**Plan:**

* Continue invasive ventilation and XRT as planned.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilation settings as necessary.
* Send cultures and a differential count on the CBC to monitor for infection.
* Replenish the patient's electrolytes and consider transfusions to maintain a HCT above 23.
* Monitor the patient's atrial flutter and consider anticoagulation if necessary.
* Monitor the patient's edema and I/Os to prevent complications.
* Continue to monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust her treatment as necessary.
* Take prophylactic measures to prevent VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.

   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - anticoagulation not indicated in this patient given expected
   lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed
   (CHADS = 0)
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.

 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, intubated and receiving XRT and chemotherapy to shrink the mediastinal mass causing airway obstruction. The patient has a history of respiratory failure, anemia, atrial flutter, and asthma.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Heart rate: 84 bpm (normal sinus rhythm)
* Blood pressure: 95/46 mmHg (normal)
* Respiratory rate: 6 inspirations per minute (normal)
* SpO2: 95% (normal)

The patient has been experiencing episodes of atrial flutter, which has been treated with diltiazem to control the heart rate. The patient has also been experiencing wheezing, which is likely due to tumor airway involvement rather than bronchospasm.

Laboratory results:

* White blood cell count: 9.7 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 385 K/μL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 34 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 137 mmol/L, potassium 4.0 mmol/L, chloride 25.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.7 g/dL
* Lactic dehydrogenase: 255 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.2 mg/dL

The patient has received eight days of antibiotics for a Moraxella infection and is currently receiving XRT and chemotherapy. The patient is also receiving pressure support ventilation and is being monitored for progression of the mediastinal mass.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the mediastinal mass causing airway obstruction.
2. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter may recur, and anticoagulation may be necessary to prevent stroke.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding or bone marrow suppression.
4. Infection: The patient may develop a secondary infection, particularly in the respiratory tract, due to the prolonged use of antibiotics and the presence of a central line.
5. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding risk may increase due to the presence of a mediastinal mass and the use of anticoagulation therapy.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient may develop an electrolyte imbalance due to the use of diuretics, antibiotics, or chemotherapy.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient may develop nutritional deficiencies due to the prolonged use of parenteral nutrition and the inability to consume adequate oral nutrition.
8. Sepsis: The patient may develop sepsis due to the presence of a central line and the prolonged use of antibiotics.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to prevent these potential complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, [**10-17**] doses received thus far
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  The patient had been febrile during admission; sputum cx grew
   out Moraxella, now s/p eight day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT/chemo per above
   - failed extubation earlier in hospital course, now re-intubated
   - pressure support (daily SBT) as tolerated
   - repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass
   - if no successful movement toward extubation, will have to consider
   trach
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - anticoagulation not indicated in this patient given expected
   lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed
   (CHADS = 0)
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways. She was intubated after a bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU for XRT and chemo to shrink the tumor sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* T-max: 37.8°C (100°F)
* T-current: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* HR: 84 bpm (84-163 bpm)
* BP: 95/46 mmHg (57/52-138/91 mmHg)
* RR: 6 inspirations per minute (6-18 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 95%

The patient's respiratory support is provided by a ventilator, and she is receiving oxygen therapy through an endotracheal tube. Her lung function is compromised, with a respiratory system resistance of 32.1 cmH2O/mL.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 9.7-8.7 K/uL
* Hct: 27.9-23.7%
* Plt: 385-78 K/uL
* Cr: 0.5-0.4 mg/dL
* TCO2: 34-35 mmHg
* Glucose: 133-141 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.0/26.3/1.1, ALT/AST: 20/18, Alk Phos/T Bili: 141/0.2, Differential-Neuts: 85.4%, Lymph: 6.3%, Mono: 5.7%, Eos: 2.5%, Albumin: 2.7 g/dL, LDH: 255 IU/L, Ca++: 8.0 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 2.2 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* XRT for 10 doses, with 10 doses received so far
* Chemo initiated on [**5-16**], with the last dose on 4/11
* Follow-up with Rad Onc and Heme/Onc/Cutaneous Malign team
* Repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass
* If no successful movement toward extubation, consideration of tracheostomy

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to continued compromise of lung function
* Atrial flutter recurrence despite rate control with diltiazem
* Anemia/HCT drop requiring transfusion
* Metastatic melanoma progression and spread
* Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and immunosuppression
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to tumor involvement and anticoagulation
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to pericardial tumor involvement

The patient's code status is full, and she has a husband who has been informed of her condition. The patient's disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

   On this day I examined Mrs [**Known lastname 11723**] and I was present for the key
   portion of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]
s note
   above and largely agree with his findings and plan of care.  The
   patient had an episode of agitation last night that threatened another
   self extubation. Hence she is more significantly  sedated and
   comfortable on the vent today. Exam still has prolonged exhalation
   phase and diffuse rhonchi.   As per my note yesterday, I believe we
   need to await her 2 remaining XRT treatments and then re image with CT
   (not on PEEP or just a small amount
 such as PSV 5/0).  Repeat bronch
   may also be necessary.  If no major improvement in large airway caliber
   is seen (on no or low level vent support) then CMO strategy would be
   clearly needed.  For now I would keep her relatively heavily sedated
   and minimize interventions for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma and lung metastases, compressing the left atrium. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She has a history of recurrent atrial flutter and has been experiencing fever, delirium, and pain. Her current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 103/82 mmHg. Her respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 99%. Her neurological status is sedated, with no response to stimuli.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to her underlying condition and the use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and delirium may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen her condition and increase the risk of complications.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's metastatic melanoma is compressing the left atrium, which could lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
4. Sedation-related complications: The patient is heavily sedated, which could lead to respiratory depression, hypotension, or other complications.
5. Intubation-related complications: The patient is intubated, which could lead to complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, tracheal stenosis, or other respiratory complications.
6. Cancer progression: The patient's metastatic melanoma could progress, leading to further complications and a worse prognosis.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving nutrition through an enteral tube, which could lead to nutritional deficiencies if not managed properly.
8. Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels are slightly elevated, which could lead to complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia if not managed properly.
9. Pressure ulcer development: The patient is at risk of developing pressure ulcers due to her immobility and the use of medical devices such as tubes and lines.
10. DVT and VAP: The patient is at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to her immobility and the use of mechanical ventilation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with metastatic melanoma and acute respiratory failure. He has received chemotherapy and is scheduled to receive his 10th and final dose of radiation therapy this week. He failed extubation three days ago and is not yet ready to be extubated, but may be tried on partial support ventilation (PSV) for now.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 103/82 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with a ventilator set at 450 mL and a PEEP of 10 cmH2O.

The patient has a history of recurrent atrial flutter, which is being rate-controlled with diltiazem. His laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase levels.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a well-nourished and overweight/obese appearance, with normal cardiovascular and respiratory examination findings. His neurologic examination is limited due to sedation.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen, leading to further respiratory distress and potential need for more aggressive respiratory support.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's recurrent atrial flutter may convert to atrial fibrillation, which could lead to hemodynamic instability and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to chemotherapy and radiation therapy may increase his risk of infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis.
4. Hemorrhage: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase his risk of bleeding, particularly if he requires invasive procedures or has traumatic injuries.
5. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's metastatic melanoma may progress, leading to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his care accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, [**10-17**] doses received thus far
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  The patient had been febrile during admission; sputum cx grew
   out Moraxella, now s/p eight day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT/chemo per above
   - failed extubation earlier in hospital course, now re-intubated,
   continue at current settings
   - pressure support (daily SBT) as tolerated
   - repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass
   - if no successful movement toward extubation after completing XRT
   treatments, will have to consider terminal extubation vs. trach with
   d/c to hospice.  Will discuss with family today and consider palliative
   care consult after meeting.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - anticoagulation not indicated in this patient given expected
   lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed
   (CHADS = 0)
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways. She is intubated and being treated with radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation. She has a history of respiratory failure, anemia, atrial flutter, and asthma, all likely related to the mediastinal mass. She is currently receiving infusions of midazolam and fentanyl, as well as antibiotics for a secondary infection. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/55 mmHg.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is likely to worsen due to the mediastinal mass compressing her airways. She may require further interventions, such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation.
2. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is likely to recur, and she may require further anticoagulation and rate control measures.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding or inadequate transfusion support.
4. Infection: The patient's secondary infection may progress, requiring further antibiotic treatment and potential surgical intervention.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiopulmonary status is likely to deteriorate due to the mediastinal mass and her underlying disease.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient may experience gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction due to the mediastinal mass compressing her esophagus or intestines.
7. Neurological complications: The patient may experience neurological symptoms due to the mediastinal mass compressing her brain or spinal cord.

Recommendations:

1. Continue XRT and chemotherapy as planned to shrink the mediastinal mass and improve the patient's respiratory status.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider further interventions, such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation, if necessary.
3. Manage the patient's atrial flutter with rate control measures and anticoagulation, as appropriate.
4. Continue transfusion support to maintain a hemoglobin level of greater than 23%.
5. Monitor the patient's infection status closely and adjust antibiotic treatment as necessary.
6. Consider further imaging studies, such as CT scans or MRI, to monitor the patient's disease progression and potential complications.
7. Provide palliative care support to the patient and her family, as necessary, to manage her symptoms and improve her quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, [**10-17**] doses received thus far

   above.  The patient had been febrile during admission; sputum cx grew
   out Moraxella, now s/p eight day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT/chemo per above
   - failed extubation earlier in hospital course, now re-intubated,
   continue at current settings
   - pressure support (daily SBT) as tolerated
   - repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass
   - if no successful movement toward extubation after completing XRT
   treatments, will have to consider terminal extubation vs. trach with
   d/c to hospice.  Will discuss with family today and consider palliative
   care consult after meeting.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma, intubated due to severe airway impingement caused by a large mediastinal mass. The patient has undergone XRT and chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor to allow for successful extubation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory support: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is 106/55 mmHg, heart rate is 98 beats per minute, and central venous pressure (CVP) is not available.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 2,332 mL of fluid over the past 24 hours, with 1,328 mL being given through the total parenteral nutrition (TPN) line and 824 mL being given through the intravenous fluid (IVF) line.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 6.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin is 7.1 g/dL, and platelet count is 342 x 10^9/L. The patient's lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is 255 IU/L, and her calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels are within normal limits.
* Imaging studies: The patient's chest computed tomography (CT) scan shows a large mediastinal mass, and her brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is pending.
* Medical history: The patient has a history of metastatic melanoma, and her current treatment plan includes XRT and chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor to allow for successful extubation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may experience further respiratory failure if her mediastinal mass continues to compress her airways.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial flutter may recur, and she may be at risk for ventricular arrhythmias if her cardiac function deteriorates.
* Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's melanoma may cause bleeding, and she may be at risk for hemorrhagic complications if her platelet count drops further.
* Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state may make her more susceptible to infection, and she may require close monitoring for signs of infection.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and HCT drop may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, and she may require close monitoring for signs of bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue XRT and chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor to allow for successful extubation.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust her ventilator settings as needed.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust her anticoagulation therapy as needed.
* Monitor the patient's hemoglobin and platelet count closely and transfuse as needed.
* Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely and adjust her fluid and electrolyte therapy as needed.
* Monitor the patient's nutritional status closely and adjust her nutrition plan as needed.
* Monitor the patient's mental status closely and provide psychological support as needed.
* Consider palliative care consult if the patient's condition worsens."

   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, [**10-17**] doses received thus far
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  The patient had been febrile during admission; sputum cx grew
   out Moraxella, now s/p eight day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT/chemo per above
   - failed extubation earlier in hospital course, now re-intubated
   - pressure support (daily SBT) as tolerated
   - repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass
   - if no successful movement toward extubation, will have to consider
   trach
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - anticoagulation not indicated in this patient given expected
   lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed
   (CHADS = 0)
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways. She is currently intubated and receiving XRT and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 98 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 106/55 mmHg. She is receiving midazolam and fentanyl infusions for sedation and pain management.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 7.1 g/dL, and a decreased white blood cell count, with a count of 6.5 K/uL. Her platelet count is 342 K/uL, and her liver enzymes are slightly elevated.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a respiratory rate of 15 inspirations per minute and a SpO2 of 98%. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute.

The patient's medical history is significant for metastatic melanoma, which is causing her respiratory failure. She has been febrile during her admission and has been treated with antibiotics for a respiratory infection.

The patient's anemia is stable, and her hemoglobin level is being monitored. She is receiving transfusions to maintain a hemoglobin level above 23%.

The patient's atrial flutter is likely caused by pericardial tumor involvement, and she is being monitored for recurrence. She is receiving rate control medication with diltiazem to prevent atrial flutter.

The patient's asthma is likely secondary to tumor airway involvement, and she is not receiving bronchodilators due to the risk of exacerbating her atrial flutter.

The patient's code status is full, and her disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and she is at risk of developing further respiratory failure.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but she is at risk of developing further anemia due to her underlying medical condition.
3. Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is likely caused by pericardial tumor involvement, and she is at risk of developing further atrial flutter or other cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Infection: The patient has been febrile during her admission, and she is at risk of developing further infections due to her compromised immune system.
5. Bleeding: The patient's metastatic melanoma is at risk of bleeding, and she is at risk of developing bleeding complications due to her anticoagulation therapy.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial flutter is likely caused by pericardial tumor involvement, and she is at risk of developing further cardiac complications, such as cardiac tamponade or cardiogenic shock.

Overall, the patient is at high risk of developing further medical complications due to her underlying medical condition and compromised respiratory and cardiac status."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, [**10-17**] doses received thus far
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  The patient had been febrile during admission; sputum cx grew
   out Moraxella, now s/p eight day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT/chemo per above
   - failed extubation earlier in hospital course, now re-intubated
   - pressure support (daily SBT) as tolerated
   - repeat CT to monitor progress of mediastinal mass
   - if no successful movement toward extubation, will have to consider
   trach
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - anticoagulation not indicated in this patient given expected
   lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed
   (CHADS = 0)
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways. She has been intubated and is receiving XRT and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.9°F)
* Heart rate: 98 bpm (82-102 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 106/55 mmHg (66-119/82-87 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 15 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.5-8.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 7.1-8.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 342-85 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.3-0.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 117-141 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.7 g/dL
* Lactate dehydrogenase: 255 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.1 mg/dL

The patient has several medical complications, including:

* Respiratory failure: likely due to the mediastinal mass
* Anemia: stable, with a goal of hemoglobin >23 g/dL
* Atrial flutter: likely due to pericardial tumor involvement, but has reverted to normal sinus rhythm
* Asthma: likely secondary to tumor airway involvement, not bronchospasm

The patient is receiving several medications, including:

* Midazolam (Versed): 2 mg/hour
* Fentanyl (Concentrate): 75 mcg/hour
* Diltiazem: 15 mg PO q6h for rate control
* Prophylactic medications: Pneumoboots, H2 blocker

The patient's plan is to continue XRT and chemotherapy, with a goal of shrinking the mediastinal mass and allowing for successful extubation. If the patient does not show clinical improvement, tracheostomy may be considered.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: worsening of the patient's respiratory status
* Anemia: worsening of the patient's anemia, leading to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues
* Atrial flutter: recurrence of atrial flutter, leading to arrhythmias and decreased cardiac output
* Asthma: worsening of the patient's asthma, leading to bronchospasm and decreased lung function
* Bleeding: bleeding due to the patient's underlying melanoma and anticoagulation therapy
* Infection: infection due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged hospitalization."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Bronchoscopy disclosed evidence for airway
   patency in right and left mainstem (improved) -- trachea not evaluated,
   but failed self-extubation trial.  Continue mechanical ventilation.
   Continue XRT to completion (final session #10 tomorrow).  Monitor
   repeat CT scan when XRT complete.  If no significant change in thoracic
   CT and no further treatment planned, will consider extubation (no
   trach) as per discussion with husband.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed in part to addition of steroids
   (Decadron).  Resolved.  Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 LLL pneuonian, and now RUL infiltrate.  Continue
   antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Falling  Hct (in addition to wBC and plts) --> may be in
   part related to chemotherapy.  Monitor stool guiac.  Continue serial
   Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and extensive mediastinal mass causing central airway compression, leading to respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place, and a trial of self-extubation failed. She is receiving radiation therapy (XRT) to shrink the tumor, and repeat CT scans will be monitored for significant changes. The patient has a history of pneumonia, anemia, and tachycardia, which are attributed to the tumor involvement. She also has asthma-like symptoms, which are likely secondary to tumor airway involvement.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory failure is primarily attributed to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression. If not managed properly, this can lead to further respiratory compromise, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and ultimately, cardiac arrest.
2. **Pneumonia:** The patient has a history of pneumonia, which is ongoing, and may worsen if not treated effectively. This can lead to sepsis, multi-organ dysfunction, and increased mortality.
3. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia is attributed to chemotherapy and may worsen if not managed properly. This can lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues, increased risk of infections, and decreased immune function.
4. **Tachycardia:** The patient's tachycardia is attributed to mediastinal involvement by the tumor and may worsen if not managed properly. This can lead to increased cardiac workload, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
5. **Atrial Flutter:** The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which is attributed in part to pericardial involvement by the tumor. This can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of cardiac arrest.
6. **Hyperglycemia:** The patient's hyperglycemia is attributed to decadron and may worsen if not managed properly. This can lead to decreased immune function, increased risk of infections, and decreased wound healing.
7. **Fluid Imbalance:** The patient's fluid balance is critical, and any imbalance can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac compromise, and decreased organ function.
8. **Infection:** The patient is at high risk of developing infections, particularly pneumonia, due to her underlying medical condition and immunosuppression.
9. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's cardiac status is critical, and any cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, or cardiac arrest, can have significant consequences.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and respiratory support to manage respiratory failure.
2. Monitor and manage pneumonia aggressively to prevent worsening of the condition.
3. Manage anemia with blood transfusions and monitor stool guaiac to detect any gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Monitor and manage tachycardia with medications and cardiac monitoring to prevent cardiac complications.
5. Continue atrial flutter monitoring and management with medications to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Monitor and manage hyperglycemia with insulin therapy to prevent long-term complications.
7. Monitor fluid balance closely and adjust as necessary to prevent respiratory failure and cardiac compromise.
8. Monitor for signs of infection and take prompt action to treat any infections that develop.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and take prompt action to treat any cardiac complications that develop."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Bronchoscopy yesterday disclosed evidence for
   airway patency in right and left mainstem (improved) -- trachea not
   evaluated.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT and
   chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size, allowing
   reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work towards
   extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed in part to addition of steroids
   (Decadron).  Resolved.  Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Falling  Hct (in addition to wBC and plts) --> may be in
   part related to chemotherapy.  Monitor stool guiac.  Continue serial
   Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   evaluated.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Continue XRT and
   chemotherapy with hope for reducing mediastinal tumor size, allowing
   reduction of extrinsic airways obstruction and hopefuly work towards
   extubate.  Monitor CXR and repeat CT scan when XRT complete.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed in part to addition of steroids
   (Decadron).  Resolved.  Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 continue antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Falling  Hct (in addition to wBC and plts) --> may be in
   part related to chemotherapy.  Monitor stool guiac.  Continue serial
   Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression caused by the mediastinal mass. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the mediastinal tumor is not reduced in size.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated for pneumonia, and there is a risk of worsening of the infection or development of new complications.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreasing, which may be related to chemotherapy. There is a risk of worsening anemia if not properly managed.
4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has a fluid imbalance, which may lead to complications such as hypotension, edema, or organ failure if not managed properly.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be attributed to mediastinal involvement by the tumor and may worsen if not managed.
6. Atrial Flutter: The patient has a high risk of recurrence of atrial flutter, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and complications.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may be attributed to steroids and may worsen if not managed properly.
8. Metastatic Melanoma: The patient has metastatic melanoma, which is a life-threatening condition that may progress if not properly managed.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should continue to receive mechanical ventilation, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy to reduce the size of the mediastinal tumor. The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to prevent fluid overload. The patient's anemia should be managed with blood transfusions and other supportive measures. The patient's tachycardia and atrial flutter should be managed with medication and other interventions as needed. The patient's hyperglycemia should be managed with insulin and other measures to maintain a safe blood glucose level. Finally, the patient's metastatic melanoma should be closely monitored for progression and managed with a multidisciplinary team approach."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, [**10-17**] doses received thus far
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - no CT scan
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  The patient had been febrile during admission; sputum cx grew
   out Moraxella, now s/p eight day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT/chemo per above
   - failed extubation earlier in hospital course, now re-intubated,
   continue at current settings
   - pressure support (daily SBT) as tolerated
   - if no successful movement toward extubation after completing XRT
   treatments, will have to consider terminal extubation vs. trach with
   d/c to hospice.  Will discuss with family today and consider palliative
   care consult after meeting.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - anticoagulation not indicated in this patient given expected
   lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed
   (CHADS = 0)
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, [**10-17**] doses received thus far
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - no CT scan
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  The patient had been febrile during admission; sputum cx grew
   out Moraxella, now s/p eight day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT/chemo per above
   - failed extubation earlier in hospital course, now re-intubated,
   continue at current settings
   - pressure support (daily SBT) as tolerated
   - if no successful movement toward extubation after completing XRT
   treatments, will have to consider terminal extubation vs. trach with
   d/c to hospice.  Will discuss with family today and consider palliative
   care consult after meeting.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - anticoagulation not indicated in this patient given expected
   lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed
   (CHADS = 0)
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 15mg PO q6h,
   as she has been hypotensive with higher doses.
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways. She has been intubated and is receiving radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation. The patient has been experiencing transient hypoxic episodes, which were managed with IV diltiazem. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 109/50 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She has a history of anemia and has been transfused with blood products. Her lab results show stable hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is at risk of developing further respiratory failure due to her mediastinal mass and underlying disease.
2. Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which may recur, and she is at risk of developing further arrhythmias due to her underlying disease.
3. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, and her hemoglobin and hematocrit levels may continue to decline, potentially leading to further complications.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia, and she is at risk of developing further infections due to her immunocompromised state.
5. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding due to her melanoma, and she is at risk of further bleeding due to her anticoagulation status.
6. Malnutrition: The patient is at risk of malnutrition due to her prolonged hospitalization and underlying disease.
7. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing pressure ulcers due to her prolonged immobility and underlying disease.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilator settings as necessary.
2. Monitor the patient's atrial flutter and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
3. Continue to transfuse the patient with blood products as necessary to maintain her hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.
4. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and adjust her antibiotic regimen as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust her anticoagulation status as necessary.
6. Implement a nutrition plan to prevent malnutrition and promote wound healing.
7. Implement a pressure ulcer prevention plan to prevent pressure ulcers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   As the mass is causing severe impingement on the patient
s airways, the
   plan is to provide XRT, chemo with the goal of shrinking the tumor
   sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for
   stent placement.
   - XRT plan for 10 doses, [**10-17**] doses received thus far
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - F/u CT read, email [**Last Name (un) 12012**]
   - f/u Rad Onc recs
   - heme/onc, cutaneous malign team following
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  The patient had been febrile during admission; sputum cx grew
   out Moraxella, now s/p eight day treatment with Levo/Unasyn
   - XRT/chemo per above
   - failed extubation earlier in hospital course, now re-intubated,
   continue at current settings
   - pressure support (daily SBT) as tolerated
   - if no successful movement toward extubation after completing XRT
   treatments, will have to consider terminal extubation vs. trach with
   d/c to hospice.  Will discuss with family today and consider palliative
   care consult after meeting.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Stable.
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   - transfusion goal hct >23
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - anticoagulation not indicated in this patient given expected
   lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed
   (CHADS = 0)
   - rate control with diltiazem , threshold HR 90, change to 30 mg QID,
   watching BP
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass causing severe impingement on her airways. She was intubated after bronchoscopy and transferred to the ICU to begin radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and allow for successful extubation.

Current status:

* Respiratory support: The patient is currently on a ventilator with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is 109/50 mmHg, heart rate is 86 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98%.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 8.6, hemoglobin is 7.1 g/dL, and platelet count is 358,000 per microliter. Her electrolyte levels are within normal range, and her liver function tests are mildly elevated.
* Medications: The patient is receiving fentanyl, midazolam, and diltiazem for pain, anxiety, and rate control, respectively.

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to her mediastinal mass and underlying lung disease.
* Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk of developing another episode due to her immunocompromised state and respiratory therapy.
* Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which is likely related to her pericardial tumor involvement. She is at risk of developing recurrent atrial flutter and may require anticoagulation therapy.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, and she is at risk of developing anemia due to her underlying disease and blood loss.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient is at risk of developing electrolyte imbalances due to her underlying disease, medications, and respiratory therapy.
* Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to her immunocompromised state and respiratory therapy.

Assessment and plan:

* The patient's respiratory status will be closely monitored, and she will be weaned off the ventilator as tolerated.
* The patient will continue to receive XRT and chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and improve her respiratory status.
* The patient's anemia will be closely monitored, and transfusions will be given as needed to maintain a hemoglobin level greater than 23.
* The patient's atrial flutter will be closely monitored, and anticoagulation therapy will be considered if necessary.
* The patient's electrolyte levels will be closely monitored, and electrolyte imbalances will be corrected as necessary.
* The patient will be closely monitored for signs of infection, and antibiotics will be given as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Bronchoscopy disclosed evidence for airway
   patency in right and left mainstem (improved) -- trachea not evaluated,
   but failed self-extubation trial.  Continue mechanical ventilation.
   Continue XRT to completion (final session #10 tomorrow).  XRT comlete.
   Await final read on repeat Chest CT today.  If no significant change in
   thoracic CT and no further treatment planned, will consider extubation
   (no trach) as per discussion with husband.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed in part to addition of steroids
   (Decadron).  Resolved.  Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 LLL pneuonian, and now RUL infiltrate.  Continue
   antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Falling  Hct (in addition to wBC and plts) --> may be in
   part related to chemotherapy.  Monitor stool guiac.  Continue serial
   Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Bronchoscopy disclosed evidence for airway
   patency in right and left mainstem (improved) -- trachea not evaluated,
   but failed self-extubation trial.  Continue mechanical ventilation.
   Continue XRT to completion (final session #10 tomorrow).  XRT comlete.
   Await final read on repeat Chest CT today.  If no significant change in
   thoracic CT and no further treatment planned, will consider extubation
   (no trach) as per discussion with husband.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed in part to addition of steroids
   (Decadron).  Resolved.  Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 LLL pneuonian, and now RUL infiltrate.  Continue
   antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Falling  Hct (in addition to wBC and plts) --> may be in
   part related to chemotherapy.  Monitor stool guiac.  Continue serial
   Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU and identify potential medical complications that can arise.

**Summary of Patient's Health Progress:**

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a mediastinal mass causing severe extrinsic compression of airways. She is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving XRT to completion, and the plan is to provide further treatment to shrink the tumor sufficiently to allow for successful extubation.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory failure is primarily attributed to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression. There is a risk of further deterioration of respiratory status, which may require further interventions such as tracheostomy or non-invasive ventilation.
2. **Pneumonia:** The patient has developed LLL pneumonia and now RUL infiltrate, which may worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia may be related to chemotherapy and may worsen her overall condition, particularly if not addressed promptly.
4. **Fluid Imbalance:** The patient's fluid balance is critical, and there is a risk of developing hypovolemia or fluid overload, which may require close monitoring and adjustments to fluid administration.
5. **Tachycardia:** The patient's tachycardia may be attributed to mediastinal involvement by tumor and may worsen her overall condition if not addressed promptly.
6. **Atrial Flutter:** The patient's atrial flutter is a high-risk condition, and there is a risk of recurrence despite medications. Close monitoring and adjustments to medications may be necessary to prevent complications.
7. **Hyperglycemia:** The patient's hyperglycemia is attributed to decadron and may worsen her overall condition if not addressed promptly.
8. **Infection:** The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central lines and tubes increase the risk of infection, which may require prompt recognition and treatment.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as necessary.
2. Administer antibiotics to complete the course for pneumonia and monitor for signs of VAP.
3. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusions if necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid balance and adjust fluid administration as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's tachycardia and adjust medications as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial flutter and adjust medications as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's hyperglycemia and adjust medications as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of infection and take prompt action if necessary.

**ICU Care Plan:**

1. Nutrition: Continue to replete with fiber and monitor for signs of malnutrition.
2. Glycemic Control: Monitor and maintain blood glucose levels <150.
3. Lines: Continue to use multi-lumen lines and monitor for signs of infection.
4. Prophylaxis: Continue to use DVT boots, systemic anticoagulation, and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
5. VAP: Continue to elevate the head of bed and monitor for signs of VAP.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Bronchoscopy disclosed evidence for airway
   patency in right and left mainstem (improved) -- trachea not evaluated,
   but failed self-extubation trial.  Continue mechanical ventilation.
   Completed XRT (#10) XRT.  Await final read on repeat Chest CT today.
   If no significant change in thoracic CT and no further treatment
   planned, will consider extubation (no trach) as per discussion with
   husband.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed in part to addition of steroids
   (Decadron).  Resolved.  Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 LLL pneumonia, and now RUL infiltrate.  Continue
   antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Falling  Hct (in addition to wBC and plts) --> may be in
   part related to chemotherapy.  Monitor stool guiac.  Continue serial
   Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure caused by airway obstruction and extrinsic compression from a mediastinal mass.

The patient has been experiencing episodes of tachycardia, which has been attributed to mediastinal involvement by the tumor. The tachycardia has been responsive to IV diltiazem.

The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and the plan is to continue mechanical ventilation until the mediastinal mass is sufficiently shrunk to allow for successful extubation.

The patient has a white blood cell count elevation, which has been attributed in part to the addition of steroids (Decadron). The elevation has resolved, and the patient's WBC count is being monitored.

The patient has also been diagnosed with anemia, which is being monitored with serial Hct measurements and stool guaiac tests.

The patient's fluid status is being closely monitored, with a plan to maintain a balance between intake and output.

The patient has been experiencing wheezing, which is likely secondary to tumor airway involvement rather than bronchospasm. The patient's hyperglycemia has been attributed to the steroid medication (Decadron), and the plan is to monitor and maintain a glucose level less than 150.

The patient has a history of asthma, but the wheezing is not being treated with bronchodilators due to the risk of exacerbating atrial fibrillation.

The patient's atrial flutter is being monitored, and the plan is to continue to control the heart rate with a lower dose of diltiazem.

The patient's ICU care plan includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is ICU.

Based on the patient's condition, potential medical complications that could arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression
* Tachycardia and atrial fibrillation
* Anemia and bleeding complications
* Infection and sepsis
* Fluid imbalance and electrolyte disturbances
* Hyperglycemia and metabolic complications
* Cardiac complications, such as pericarditis and cardiac tamponade
* Neurological complications, such as seizures and brain edema

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as needed to prevent these complications and ensure the best possible outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass. She is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely caused by the mediastinal mass. She has been febrile during her admission and has had a positive CT scan, showing patchy consolidation in the right upper and middle lobes, which is likely due to radiotherapy. She has also developed a small right pleural effusion and a small left pleural effusion.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 6.5 g/dL, and a decreased platelet count. Her white blood cell count is within normal limits, but her absolute neutrophil count is low. Her liver function tests are elevated, and her albumin level is low. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but her calcium level is slightly low.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. She is receiving 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and has a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O.

The patient's plan of care includes a goal of care discussion with her oncology team and family to determine the best course of action. Options include tracheostomy, terminal wean, or terminal extubation. She is also scheduled for a bedside ultrasound and therapeutic thoracentesis to optimize her respiratory status off the ventilator.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely caused by the mediastinal mass and may worsen if not properly managed.
2. Infection: The patient's febrile episode and positive CT scan suggest the possibility of an infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
3. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and history of melanoma increase her risk of bleeding, which could be exacerbated by anticoagulation therapy.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial flutter and decreased left ventricular function increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure and arrhythmias.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to decreased oxygen delivery to her tissues and organs.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's positive CT scan and febrile episode suggest the possibility of pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure and other complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires careful management to prevent potential complications and improve her quality of life."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   Now s/p chemo/XRT with little improvement as assessed clinically and on
   CT imaging.
   - completed XRT course (10 treatments)
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - goals of care discussion with Oncology and family of patient to
   determine plan of action.  Options include tracheostomy, terminal wean,
   or terminal extubation.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  The patient had been febrile during admission; sputum cx grew
   out Moraxella, now s/p eight day treatment with Levo/Unasyn.
   - continues to require intubation.  See above re: plan.
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Slowly downtrending.  Today Hct < 21.
   - transfuse 1u pRBC
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - anticoagulation not indicated in this patient given expected
   lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed
   (CHADS = 0)
   - rate control with diltiazem 30 mg QID, threshold HR 90
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

* The patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma and a large mediastinal mass. She has undergone chemotherapy and radiation therapy with little improvement in her condition.
* She is currently intubated and requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely caused by the mediastinal mass.
* She has a fever, which has been treated with antibiotics, and has a mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.5 g/dL.
* She has a history of atrial flutter, which has reverted to normal sinus rhythm, but she is at high risk of recurrence.
* She has wheezing, likely due to tumor airway involvement, and her lung function is compromised.
* She has a decreased platelet count and an elevated white blood cell count.
* She has a history of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, which may have caused bone marrow suppression and increased her risk of bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Respiratory failure due to worsening of the mediastinal mass or development of pneumonia
* Bleeding due to platelet dysfunction or chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia
* Infection due to immunosuppression or compromised lung function
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial flutter or other cardiac conditions
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to chemotherapy-induced mucositis or malnutrition
* Neurological complications due to tumor involvement or chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity
* Renal failure due to dehydration or chemotherapy-induced nephrotoxicity

Based on these potential complications, I recommend the following:

* Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as necessary.
* Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusion if the count falls below 50,000/mcL.
* Monitor the patient's white blood cell count and consider antibiotics if the count falls below 1,000/mcL.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider anticoagulation therapy if atrial flutter recurs.
* Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and consider nutritional support if malnutrition is suspected.
* Monitor the patient's neurological status and consider neuroprotective measures if neurological complications arise.
* Monitor the patient's renal status and consider dialysis if renal failure develops."

   2)Slight improvement in the right main and left mainstem bronchial
   narrowing
   which remains severe.
   Assessment and Plan
   51 yo F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b large mediastinal mass, intubated
   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   Now s/p chemo/XRT with little improvement as assessed clinically and on
   CT imaging.
   - completed XRT course (10 treatments)
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - goals of care discussion with Oncology and family of patient to
   determine plan of action.  Options include tracheostomy, terminal wean,
   or terminal extubation.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  The patient had been febrile during admission; sputum cx grew
   out Moraxella, now s/p eight day treatment with Levo/Unasyn.
   - continues to require intubation.  See above re: plan.
   - will image R pleural effusion with bedside u/s and consider
   therapeutic thoracentesis prior to extubation (plan for Sunday or
   Monday) to optimize respiratory status off vent
   - start steroids for underlying pneumonitis
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Slowly downtrending.  Today Hct < 21.
   - transfuse 1u pRBC
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - anticoagulation not indicated in this patient given expected
   lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed
   (CHADS = 0)
   - rate control with diltiazem 30 mg QID, threshold HR 90
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   s/p bronchoscopy on [**5-9**] and transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] to begin XRT
   .
   # Metastatic melanoma
 Mediastinal mass path positive for melanoma.
   Now s/p chemo/XRT with little improvement as assessed clinically and on
   CT imaging.
   - completed XRT course (10 treatments)
   - chemo initiated [**5-16**], last dose 4/11
   - goals of care discussion with Oncology and family of patient to
   determine plan of action.  Options include tracheostomy, terminal wean,
   or terminal extubation.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Likely [**3-11**] mediastinal mass as discussed
   above.  The patient had been febrile during admission; sputum cx grew
   out Moraxella, now s/p eight day treatment with Levo/Unasyn.
   - continues to require intubation.  See above re: plan.
   - will image R pleural effusion with bedside u/s and consider
   therapeutic thoracentesis prior to extubation (plan for Sunday or
   Monday) to optimize respiratory status off vent
   - start steroids for underlying pneumonitis
   .
   # Anemia/HCT drop
 Slowly downtrending.  Today Hct < 21.
   - transfuse 1u pRBC
   - trend HCT, guaiac stool
   .
   # atrial flutter
 Likely from pericardial tumor involvement, at this
   time reverted to normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of
   recurrence.  Ruled out by enzymes.
   - anticoagulation not indicated in this patient given expected
   lifespan, aggregate risk of stroke, and propensity of melanoma to bleed
   (CHADS = 0)
   - rate control with diltiazem 30 mg QID, threshold HR 90
   .
   # asthma
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm. Avoiding bronchodilators as they will exacerbate
   atrial flutter.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with a history of metastatic melanoma, currently intubated and in the ICU. The patient's condition has been stable, with no significant changes in vital signs, except for a temperature of 102.5°F (39.2°C) at 12:00 AM, which was treated with increased dosing of Diltiazem.

The patient's CT scan showed unchanged dimensions, with slight improvement in bronchial constriction, but left lower lobe (LLL) remains collapsed. The oncology team was informed of the CT results and will be coming by tomorrow.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 8.6-5.1 K/uL
* Hct: 28.0-20.9%
* Plt: 358-318 K/uL
* Cr: 0.3-0.4 mg/dL
* TCO2: 34-35 mmHg
* Glucose: 117-135 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.0/26.3/1.1, ALT/AST: 20/18, Alk Phos/T Bili: 141/0.2, Differential-Neuts: 85.4%, Lymph: 6.3%, Mono: 5.7%, Eos: 2.5%, Albumin: 2.7 g/dL, LDH: 255 IU/L, Ca++: 7.9 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL, PO4: 3.8 mg/dL

The patient's respiratory status remains critical, with ongoing respiratory failure likely due to the mediastinal mass. The patient continues to require intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's anemia and Hct drop are slowly downtrending, with a current Hct of <21%. The plan is to transfuse 1 unit of packed red blood cells and trend Hct and guaiac stool.

The patient's atrial flutter is likely due to pericardial tumor involvement, but has reverted to normal sinus rhythm. However, the patient remains at high risk of recurrence and will be monitored closely.

The patient's asthma is likely secondary to tumor airway involvement, and bronchodilators will be avoided to prevent exacerbating atrial flutter.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains critical, and ongoing respiratory failure can lead to further decline in lung function and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and antibiotic treatment for Moraxella pneumonia suggest that infection is a possibility, and the patient may be at risk for further infections.
3. Bleeding: The patient's history of melanoma and atrial flutter increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of anticoagulation therapy.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia and Hct drop require close monitoring and transfusion support to prevent further decline in oxygen-carrying capacity.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium and magnesium, require close monitoring to prevent imbalance and potential cardiac complications.
6. Pneumonitis: The patient's respiratory status and recent chest CT scan suggest that pneumonitis is a possibility, and the patient may require further treatment and monitoring.

Based on this information, the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, particularly temperature, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Continue antibiotic treatment for Moraxella pneumonia and monitor for signs of infection.
3. Maintain mechanical ventilation and continue to optimize respiratory status.
4. Monitor the patient's anemia and Hct drop, and provide transfusion support as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment accordingly.
6. Consider further imaging studies, such as a chest CT scan, to assess the patient's respiratory status and potential complications.
7. Continue to discuss the patient's goals of care with the oncology team and family, and consider tracheostomy, terminal wean, or terminal extubation as options."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Completed XRT
   (#10) XRT.  No significant change in tumor burden.  Awaiting further
   Oncology evaluation, to determine if any additional interventions are
   available for treatment of melanoma.  If no treatment options, will
   consider extubation (no trach) as per discussion with husband.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed in part to addition of steroids
   (Decadron).  Resolved.  Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 LLL pneumonia, and now RUL infiltrate.  Continue
   antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Falling  Hct (in addition to wBC and plts) --> may be in
   part related to chemotherapy.  Monitor stool guiac.  Continue serial
   Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 yof F h/o metastatic melanoma c/b extensive mediastinal mass with
   central airway compression.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- predominately attributed to airway obstruction,
   extrinsic compression.  Continue mechanical ventilation.  Completed XRT
   (#10) XRT.  No significant change in tumor burden.  Awaiting further
   Oncology evaluation, to determine if any additional interventions are
   available for treatment of melanoma.  If no treatment options, will
   consider extubation (no trach) as per discussion with husband.
   WBC ELEVATION -- attributed in part to addition of steroids
   (Decadron).  Resolved.  Monitor.
   METATSTATIC MELENOMA -- Mediastinal mass pathology --> melanoma,
   causing severe extrinsic compression of airways, the plan is to provide
   XRT with the goal of shrinking the tumor sufficiently to allow for
   successful extubation.  Per IP, no plan for stent placement.
   PNEUMONIA
 LLL pneumonia, and now RUL infiltrate.  Continue
   antimicrtobial to complete course.
   ANEMIA
  ACD. Falling  Hct (in addition to wBC and plts) --> may be in
   part related to chemotherapy.  Monitor stool guiac.  Continue serial
   Hct.
   FLUIDS -- monitor CVP.  Monitor I/O.  Plan maintain balance.
   TACHYCARDIA
 attributed to mediastinal involveement by tumor.  Anxiety
   provoked.  Resolved.  Monitor HR.
   A-FLUTTER --  attributed in part to pericardial invovlement by tumor.
   Currently normal sinus rhythm, however at high risk of recurrence.
   Ruled out by enzymes.  Local atrial irritation by tumor may promote
   A-fib despite medications.  Controlled rate on current lower diltiazem
   dose.
   ASTHMA
 Wheezing most likely secondary to tumor airway involvement,
   not bronchospasm.  Prefer to avoid bronchodilators (may exacerbate
   atrial fib).
   HYPERGLYCEMIA
 attributed to decadron.  Monitor, maintian <150.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to airway obstruction and extrinsic compression caused by the mediastinal mass. Continuation of mechanical ventilation is necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has developed pneumonia, specifically in the LLL and RUL regions, which may be secondary to the mediastinal mass or other underlying conditions. Antimicrobial therapy should be continued to complete the course.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to chemotherapy, and serial Hct monitoring is recommended. Stool guaiac testing may also be necessary to evaluate for gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is crucial, and CVP monitoring is necessary to ensure adequate hydration and prevent fluid overload.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be attributed to mediastinal involvement by the tumor, and anxiety provoked by the condition. Monitoring of HR is necessary to ensure that the patient's cardiac status remains stable.
6. A-fib: The patient is at high risk of developing A-fib due to pericardial involvement by the tumor. Enzyme monitoring is necessary to rule out recurrence, and local atrial irritation by the tumor may promote A-fib despite medications.
7. Asthma: The patient's wheezing is likely secondary to tumor airway involvement rather than bronchospasm. Avoidance of bronchodilators is recommended to prevent exacerbation of atrial fib.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is attributed to decadron, and monitoring is necessary to maintain blood glucose levels below 150.
9. ICU-acquired complications: The patient is at risk of developing ICU-acquired complications such as DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. Prophylactic measures such as systemic anticoagulation, PPI, and HOB elevation are necessary to reduce the risk of these complications.

In summary, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring is necessary to address the various medical complications that may arise."
