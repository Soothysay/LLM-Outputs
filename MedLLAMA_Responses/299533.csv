You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old man admitted to the ICU with hypotension, sepsis, and severe organ dysfunction. He has a history of HIV, C. difficile, adrenal insufficiency, and worsening acidosis and renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient is critically ill and has a poor prognosis, particularly regarding renal recovery.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's severe sepsis and organ dysfunction increase the risk of further complications, such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
2. Renal failure progression: The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) is likely to worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and potential need for dialysis.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's adrenal insufficiency may exacerbate his septic shock, acidosis, and renal failure, requiring close monitoring and potential treatment with steroids.
4. HIV-related complications: The patient's new diagnosis of HIV increases the risk of opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection.
5. C. difficile colitis: The patient's C. difficile infection may worsen, leading to severe colitis, toxic megacolon, and potential need for colectomy.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's septic shock and acidosis may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's sepsis and acidosis may cause neurological complications, such as altered mental status, seizures, and potential need for intubation and mechanical ventilation.
8. Wound complications: The patient's L leg pain and erythema may indicate a wound infection, which could worsen and lead to further complications, such as osteomyelitis and sepsis.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Hypotension
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old man with a constellation of worsening medical problems, including:

1. Hypotension
2. Acute pain
3. Impaired skin integrity
4. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF)
5. Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction)

The patient has a new diagnosis of HIV, C. difficile (C. diff) with leukocytosis in the 40s, adrenal insufficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), worsening acidosis, and renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He also has left leg pain and erythema.

The patient's condition is critical, and his overall prognosis is grim given his constellation of problems, particularly the worsening renal failure. The patient requires ICU care, and the team is considering obtaining a torso/leg CT and OSH films.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further deterioration of renal function
2. Development of septic shock
3. Worsening acidosis
4. Increased risk of infections due to impaired skin integrity and immunosuppression
5. Potential for bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
6. Development of cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances
7. Increased risk of respiratory failure due to acidosis and sepsis
8. Potential for further deterioration of neurological function due to sepsis and acidosis

Given the patient's critical condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or manage potential complications and improve his outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.  Sepsis
   seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia,
   hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  No clear source since CXR and UA benign; per
   history was C diff positive at OSH nearly three weeks ago for which has
   been on PO vanc and IV flagyl; repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis.  Bcxs
   are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over past month;
   adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent hypotension.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Stool guiaic positive yesterday night so held off anticoagulation
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Poss
   2) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  It would be strange for patient to continue
   to have no response to antibiotics after this prolonged course.  Would
   be concerned for other sources of diarrhea versus hypogammoglobulinemia
   as cause of continued infection.   Given HIV concerned for other causes
   of chronic diarrhea like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too
   high for [**Doctor First Name **]
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   -Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - stool samples for O&P, isospora, crypto
   - OSH records
   3) Acute Renal Failure: Patient has unclear etiology of worsening renal
   function.  Concern for crystals in urine at OSH and it is possible that
   HAART was contributed by crystal formation or Fanconi
s syndrome.
   Still, granular casts here suggest ATN, which is also quite possible in
   context of hypotension and hypoperfusion.
   - UA with micro
   - Urine lytes and eos
   - Strict I/O's
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   4).  Thrombocytopenia
 Multiple possible etiologies for sepsis
   including MDS vs HIV vs HAART vs sepsis.  Given persistent low counts
   would be concerned that this is less likely to be due to ARV
s as
   previously thought.  Thrombocytopenia would be a common manifestation
   of MDS, however, and possible this is a chronic problem.
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR climbs
   5) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   6) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Like others picture is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] reports
   seems was recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but this could
   well suppress intrinsic adrenal access and unclear if we can obtain
   useful testing.
   -Continue dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   7) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis: Gap acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis probably attributable to infection versus
   hypotension and hypoperfusion as well as contribution of [**Last Name (un) **].  Similar
   etiologies to NAGMA.
   -daily chem. 10
   -bicarbonate in maintenance fluids overnight so as to give the patient
   more reserve in terms of ABG
   8) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  [**Name2 (NI) **] clear myelodysplastic
   syndrome treated with steroids.   Also would be slightly concerned if
   this diagnosis was made without HIV status being known as that can also
   cause cytopenias.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

**Assessment and Plan**:

1. Hypotension: Sepsis is the most likely cause, given the patient's WBC count and hypothermia. The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, which may have contributed to the hypotension.
2. Left leg swelling/tenderness: The patient has a superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.
3. C. Difficile Colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, which has been treated with vancomycin. The patient continues to have diarrhea, which may be due to other sources of infection or hypogammglobulinemia.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has unclear etiology of worsening renal function, which may be due to crystals in the urine, ATN, or other causes.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has persistent low platelet counts, which may be due to sepsis, MDS, HIV, HAART, or other causes.
6. HIV: The patient has a new diagnosis of HIV, which is unusual for an 80+ year old man.
7. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency, which may be due to recent steroid use.
8. Anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has a gap acidosis likely due to lactic acidosis, which may be attributable to infection or hypotension.
9. MDS: The patient has a diagnosis of MDS, which may have contributed to his cytopenias.
10. Other issues: The patient has a history of diabetes, and his blood glucose levels are being monitored and controlled.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.  Sepsis
   seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia,
   hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  No clear source since CXR and UA benign; per
   history was C diff positive at OSH nearly three weeks ago for which has
   been on PO vanc and IV flagyl; repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis.  Bcxs
   are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over past month;
   adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent hypotension.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Stool guiaic positive yesterday night so held off anticoagulation
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   - F/u stool samples for O&P, isospora, cryptosporidium
   - Trend lactates
   3) Acute Renal Failure: Patient has unclear etiology of worsening renal
   function.  Concern for crystals in urine at OSH and it is possible that
   HAART was contributed by crystal formation or Fanconi
s syndrome.
   Still, granular casts here suggest ATN, which is also quite possible in
   context of hypotension and hypoperfusion.
   - UA with micro
   - Urine lytes and eos
   - Strict I/O's
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   4).  Thrombocytopenia
 Multiple possible etiologies for sepsis
   including MDS vs HIV vs HAART vs sepsis.  Given persistent low counts
   would be concerned that this is less likely to be due to ARV
s as
   previously thought.  Thrombocytopenia would be a common manifestation
   of MDS, however, and possible this is a chronic problem.
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR climbs
   5) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   6) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Like others picture is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] reports
   seems was recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but this could
   well suppress intrinsic adrenal access and unclear if we can obtain
   useful testing.
   -Continue dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   7) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis: Gap acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis probably attributable to infection versus
   hypotension and hypoperfusion as well as contribution of [**Last Name (un) **].  Similar
   etiologies to NAGMA.
   -daily chem. 10
   -bicarbonate in maintenance fluids overnight so as to give the patient
   more reserve in terms of ABG
   8) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  [**Name2 (NI) **] clear myelodysplastic
   syndrome treated with steroids.   Also would be slightly concerned if
   this diagnosis was made without HIV status being known as that can also
   cause cytopenias.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -OSH records
   9)FEN - gentle D5 w/ 3 amps bicarb / replete lytes prn / diabetic diet
   10)PPX - pneumoboots (thrombocytopenia), ppi
   11) ACCESS
 L IJ
   12) CONTACT - patient, son

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.  Sepsis
   seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia,
   hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  No clear source since CXR and UA benign; per
   history was C diff positive at OSH nearly three weeks ago for which has
   been on PO vanc and IV flagyl; repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis.  Bcxs
   are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over past month;
   adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent hypotension.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Stool guiaic positive yesterday night so held off anticoagulation
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   - F/u stool samples for O&P, isospora, cryptosporidium
   - Trend lactates
   3) Acute Renal Failure: Patient has unclear etiology of worsening renal
   function.  Concern for crystals in urine at OSH and it is possible that
   HAART was contributed by crystal formation or Fanconi
s syndrome.
   Still, granular casts here suggest ATN, which is also quite possible in
   context of hypotension and hypoperfusion.
   - UA with micro
   - Urine lytes and eos
   - Strict I/O's
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   4).  Thrombocytopenia
 Multiple possible etiologies for sepsis
   including MDS vs HIV vs HAART vs sepsis.  Given persistent low counts
   would be concerned that this is less likely to be due to ARV
s as
   previously thought.  Thrombocytopenia would be a common manifestation
   of MDS, however, and possible this is a chronic problem.
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR climbs
   5) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   6) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Like others picture is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] reports
   seems was recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but this could
   well suppress intrinsic adrenal access and unclear if we can obtain
   useful testing.
   -Continue dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   7) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis: Gap acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis probably attributable to infection versus
   hypotension and hypoperfusion as well as contribution of [**Last Name (un) **].  Similar
   etiologies to NAGMA.
   -daily chem. 10
   -bicarbonate in maintenance fluids overnight so as to give the patient
   more reserve in terms of ABG
   8) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  [**Name2 (NI) **] clear myelodysplastic
   syndrome treated with steroids.   Also would be slightly concerned if
   this diagnosis was made without HIV status being known as that can also
   cause cytopenias.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, sepsis, and C. difficile colitis. The note highlights several potential medical complications, including:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient is receiving levophed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg.
2. Left leg swelling and tenderness: The patient has a superficial femoral vein clot, which may be unprovoked or provoked. This could be contributing to the patient's erythema and edema.
3. C. difficile colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, which is being treated with vancomycin and metronidazole. The patient's diarrhea persists, and other sources of diarrhea are being considered.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, and the etiology is unclear. Crystals in the urine are a possibility, and the patient is at risk for acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and multiple etiologies are being considered, including MDS, HIV, HAART, and sepsis.
6. HIV: The patient has a new diagnosis of HIV, which is unusual in an 81-year-old male. The patient's son is the primary historian, and the patient's risk factors are unclear.
7. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's adrenal function is unclear, and the patient is receiving dexamethasone to support adrenal function.
8. Anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis, which is likely due to lactic acidosis and infection.
9. MDS: The patient has a diagnosis of MDS, which is being treated with steroids.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and steroids. The patient's family is being informed of the patient's condition, and the patient's code status is full code.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* C. difficile colitis-related complications, such as toxic megacolon or perforation
* Acute renal failure-related complications, such as dialysis dependence or electrolyte imbalances
* Thrombocytopenia-related complications, such as bleeding or hemorrhage
* HIV-related complications, such as opportunistic infections or malignancies
* Adrenal insufficiency-related complications, such as hypotension or adrenal crisis
* Anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis-related complications, such as electrolyte imbalances or cardiac arrhythmias
* MDS-related complications, such as bleeding or infections.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent or treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.  Sepsis
   seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia,
   hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  No clear source since CXR and UA benign; per
   history was C diff positive at OSH nearly three weeks ago for which has
   been on PO vanc and IV flagyl; repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis.  Bcxs
   are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over past month;
   adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent hypotension.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Stool guiaic positive yesterday night so held off anticoagulation
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   - F/u stool samples for O&P, isospora, cryptosporidium
   - Trend lactates
   4) Hepatic infarct?
   -RUQ Doppler to r/o thrombus.  LFts are . . .
   5) Acute Renal Failure: Dense ATN likely in setting of persistent
   hypotension.  Anuric poor prognosis.
   - UA with micro
   - Urine lytes and eos
   - Strict I/O's
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   4).  Thrombocytopenia
 Multiple possible etiologies for sepsis
   including MDS vs HIV vs HAART vs sepsis.  Given persistent low counts
   would be concerned that this is less likely to be due to ARV
s as
   previously thought.  Thrombocytopenia would be a common manifestation
   of MDS, however, and possible this is a chronic problem.
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR climbs
   5) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   6) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Like others picture is unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **] reports
   seems was recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but this could
   well suppress intrinsic adrenal access and unclear if we can obtain
   useful testing.
   -Continue dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   7) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis: Gap acidosis likely
   due to lactic acidosis probably attributable to infection versus
   hypotension and hypoperfusion as well as contribution of [**Last Name (un) **].  Similar
   etiologies to NAGMA.
   -daily chem. 10
   -bicarbonate in maintenance fluids overnight so as to give the patient
   more reserve in terms of ABG
   8) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  [**Name2 (NI) **] clear myelodysplastic
   syndrome treated with steroids.   Also would be slightly concerned if
   this diagnosis was made without HIV status being known as that can also
   cause cytopenias.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the key points as follows:

1. The patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency, who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, sepsis, and C. difficile colitis.
2. The patient has a high white blood cell count with bandemia, suggesting an active infection, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.
3. The patient has a tender and erythematous skin rash along the left groin, thigh, and knee, which may be secondary to skin infection or cellulitis.
4. The patient has a left leg swelling and tenderness, which is suggestive of superficial femoral vein clot and possible DVT.
5. The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, which is being treated with vancomycin and metronidazole, and has a pending stool culture for other pathogens.
6. The patient has acute renal failure with anuria and a dense ATN, which is likely due to persistent hypotension.
7. The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be due to sepsis, MDS, or HIV.
8. The patient has a new diagnosis of HIV, which is unusual in an 80+ year old male, and has no known viral load or HIV testing.
9. The patient has adrenal insufficiency, which is being treated with dexamethasone, and has a pending cortisol and cosyntropin test.
10. The patient has an anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is likely due to lactic acidosis and hypotension.

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, or respiratory failure.
2. C. difficile colitis-related complications, such as bowel perforation, abscess formation, or sepsis.
3. DVT-related complications, such as pulmonary embolism or bleeding.
4. Thrombocytopenia-related bleeding or bruising.
5. Adrenal insufficiency-related complications, such as hypotension, shock, or electrolyte imbalance.
6. HIV-related complications, such as opportunistic infections or Kaposi's sarcoma.
7. MDS-related complications, such as bone marrow failure or bleeding.
8. Acute renal failure-related complications, such as electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, or uremic syndrome.
9. Anion gap and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis-related complications, such as hypotension, shock, or cardiac arrhythmias.

To manage these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his sepsis, C. difficile colitis, DVT, thrombocytopenia, adrenal insufficiency, HIV, MDS, acute renal failure, and metabolic acidosis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.  Sepsis
   seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia,
   hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  No clear source since CXR and UA benign; per
   history was C diff positive at OSH nearly three weeks ago for which has
   been on PO vanc and IV flagyl; repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis and
   prepatellar fluid and edema around left knee that could be possible
   sources.  Bcxs are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over
   past month; adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent
   hypotension and hx of AI in past.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Given stability of HCT, started on IV heparin this AM
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics to tap
   joint to ensure not septic knee
   -Using interpreter would attempt to get more history from patient re:
   his pain.
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   - F/u stool samples for O&P, isospora, cryptosporidium
   - Trend lactates
   4) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.
   -Would obtain RUQ ultrasound w/ doppler to R/o portal vein thrombosis
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   .
   5) Amylase/lipase elevation - Could be consistent with pancreatitis.
   Does not endorse abdominal pain.  Have not elicitied history of nausea
   or vomiting or anorexia.   Preliminary read from CT yesterday did not
   suggest any stranding around pancreas.  No evidence of alk phos or
   tbili elevation suggestive of stones.
   -Would obtain RUQ US for evaluation of gallbladder and CBD
   -keep NPO
   -IV fluid hydration today
   -obtain further hx with interpreter
   -trend amylase, lipase
   .
   6) Acute Renal Failure: Creatinines elevated 2.2 - 2.7.  Urinary sodium
   18, BUN 80.  Renal following; they spun urine and saw dense and
   multiple granular casts.  Most likely etiology is ATN secondary to
   persistent hypotension.  Is currently anuric and renal feels he has
   poor prognosis for his kidney disease and may take long time for
   resolution given anuria.
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Maintain BPs and perfusion to kidneys, avoid any further hypotension
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   .
   7).  Thrombocytopenia
 Unclear whether at baseline.  Has hx of MDS so
   could have low platelet production.  Platelets relatively stable, INR
   went from 1.3 -> 1.7; no overt evidence of bleeding, smear negative for
   schistos.  Other causes could be secondary to his HAART therapy or
   secondary to underlying sepsis.
   -Check coags tonight
   -Currently not on HAART therapy
   -Trend platelets daily
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR continues to climb
   .
   8) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   -f/u with ID about whether or not can restart HAART therapy
   .
   9) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.  This AM, has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia;
   checking AM cortisol and performing stim test.
   -F/u AM cortisol
   -F/u stim test
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   .
   10) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2
   is 23.  Etiology of gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic
   acid accumulation (has improved from 5.3 -> 2.9.) Also has renal
   failure on top.  Non-gap acidosis could be secondary to recent
   diarrhea, and if adrenally insufficient, hypoaldosteronism.
   -Trend lactates [**Hospital1 **]
   -Hydration today for further resolution of lactic acidosis
   -f/u stim test
   -f/u renal recs
   .
   11) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -OSH records
   12)FEN - Hydration today (can give NS 150 ccs/hr) for potential
   underlying pancreatitis as well as for lactic acidosis.  Keep NPO
   except meds for bowel rest.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low
   this AM).  K was high, giving kayexelate.
   13)PPX - pneumoboots (thrombocytopenia), ppi
   14) ACCESS
 L IJ
   15) CONTACT - patient, son
   16 )CODE - FULL
   17) DISPO - Pending clinical improvement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -abdominal CT read: notable for hyperdensity/wedge shaped area in liver
   3X 4 cm ? infarct.   Pancreas unremarkable.  Sigmoid colon shows some
   edematous/inflammatory changes which could be consistent with his c
   diff colitis hx.
   -ABG was good: 7.43, 23, 90
   -Started vanc + cefepime for broad spectrum coverage of unknown source
   for sepsis.  Continuing IV vanc + PO vanc + IV metronidazole for C
   diff.  WBC still very high.  On levophed for pressor support
   -HCT drop from 30 -> 23, stable in PM.  Evening HCT showed . . .
   -Left leg looked swollen w/ some warmth and tenderness, lower extremity
   doppler obtained which showed presence of clot in superficial femoral
   vein (still a DVT); also appears to have erythema behind left knee and
   along left thigh/groin
   -amylase and lipase showed . . .
   -renal recs:  renal failure prob secondary to ATN in setting of
   hypotension.  Oliguric; so probably will take long time for kidney to
   recover.  Feel prognosis for kidney not good.
   -cycled cardiac enzymes which were 0.04, 0.05, 0.05
   -lactate trending down
   -Given stable HCTs, started on IV heparin

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency, who was transferred to the ICU for hypotension. He has been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis, sepsis, and acute kidney injury. The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, CRP, and lactate levels, indicating ongoing inflammation and sepsis. He has also developed a DVT and a possible liver infarct. The patient's condition is unstable, and he requires ongoing management and monitoring.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to continue, and there is a risk of further deterioration in his condition.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is impaired, and there is a risk of further decline in his kidney function.
3. Liver infarct: The patient's liver infarct may lead to further complications, such as liver failure or bleeding.
4. DVT: The patient's DVT may lead to further complications, such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
5. C. difficile colitis: The patient's C. difficile colitis may lead to further complications, such as toxic megacolon or perforation.
6. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's adrenal insufficiency may lead to further complications, such as hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, or adrenal crisis.
7. HIV: The patient's new diagnosis of HIV may lead to further complications, such as opportunistic infections or immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).
8. MDS: The patient's MDS may lead to further complications, such as bleeding or infection.
9. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase and lipase levels may indicate pancreatitis, which may lead to further complications, such as pancreatic necrosis or abscess.

Given the patient's complex medical history and unstable condition, it is essential to continue monitoring his condition closely and managing his symptoms aggressively to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.  Sepsis
   seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia,
   hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  No clear source since CXR and UA benign; per
   history was C diff positive at OSH nearly three weeks ago for which has
   been on PO vanc and IV flagyl; repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis and
   prepatellar fluid and edema around left knee that could be possible
   sources.  Bcxs are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over
   past month; adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent
   hypotension and hx of AI in past.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Given stability of HCT, started on IV heparin this AM
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics to tap
   joint to ensure not septic knee
   -Using interpreter would attempt to get more history from patient re:
   his pain.
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   - F/u stool samples for O&P, isospora, cryptosporidium
   - Trend lactates
   4) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.
   -Would obtain RUQ ultrasound w/ doppler to R/o portal vein thrombosis
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   .
   5) Amylase/lipase elevation - Could be consistent with pancreatitis.
   Does not endorse abdominal pain.  Have not elicitied history of nausea
   or vomiting or anorexia.   Preliminary read from CT yesterday did not
   suggest any stranding around pancreas.  No evidence of alk phos or
   tbili elevation suggestive of stones.
   -Would obtain RUQ US for evaluation of gallbladder and CBD
   -keep NPO
   -IV fluid hydration today
   -obtain further hx with interpreter
   -trend amylase, lipase
   .
   6) Acute Renal Failure: Creatinines elevated 2.2 - 2.7.  Urinary sodium
   18, BUN 80.  Renal following; they spun urine and saw dense and
   multiple granular casts.  Most likely etiology is ATN secondary to
   persistent hypotension.  Is currently anuric and renal feels he has
   poor prognosis for his kidney disease and may take long time for
   resolution given anuria.
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Maintain BPs and perfusion to kidneys, avoid any further hypotension
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   .
   7).  Thrombocytopenia
 Unclear whether at baseline.  Has hx of MDS so
   could have low platelet production.  Platelets relatively stable, INR
   went from 1.3 -> 1.7; no overt evidence of bleeding, smear negative for
   schistos.  Other causes could be secondary to his HAART therapy or
   secondary to underlying sepsis.
   -Check coags tonight
   -Currently not on HAART therapy
   -Trend platelets daily
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR continues to climb
   .
   8) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   -f/u with ID about whether or not can restart HAART therapy
   .
   9) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.  This AM, has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia;
   checking AM cortisol and performing stim test.
   -F/u AM cortisol
   -F/u stim test
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   .
   10) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2
   is 23.  Etiology of gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic
   acid accumulation (has improved from 5.3 -> 2.9.) Also has renal

   diarrhea, and if adrenally insufficient, hypoaldosteronism.
   -Trend lactates [**Hospital1 **]
   -Hydration today for further resolution of lactic acidosis

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.  Sepsis
   seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia,
   hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  No clear source since CXR and UA benign; per
   history was C diff positive at OSH nearly three weeks ago for which has
   been on PO vanc and IV flagyl; repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis and
   prepatellar fluid and edema around left knee that could be possible
   sources.  Bcxs are pending.  Hypovolemia possible given diarrhea over
   past month; adrenal insufficiency also possible given persistent
   hypotension and hx of AI in past.
   -On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   -F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -Currently does not have good coverage for strep which may be important
   given ?cellulitis.  Touch base with ID today regarding this.
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   -AM cortisol and cosyntropin test
   .
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Given stability of HCT, started on IV heparin this AM
   -did have initial crit drop from 30 -> 23 yesterday; repeat HCTs o/n
   stable so does not seem to be actively bleeding.
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics to tap
   joint to ensure not septic knee
   -Using interpreter would attempt to get more history from patient re:
   his pain.
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   - F/u stool samples for O&P, isospora, cryptosporidium
   - Trend lactates
   4) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.
   -Would obtain RUQ ultrasound w/ doppler to R/o portal vein thrombosis
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   .
   5) Amylase/lipase elevation - Could be consistent with pancreatitis.
   Does not endorse abdominal pain.  Have not elicitied history of nausea
   or vomiting or anorexia.   Preliminary read from CT yesterday did not
   suggest any stranding around pancreas.  No evidence of alk phos or
   tbili elevation suggestive of stones.
   -Would obtain RUQ US for evaluation of gallbladder and CBD
   -keep NPO
   -IV fluid hydration today
   -obtain further hx with interpreter
   -trend amylase, lipase
   .
   6) Acute Renal Failure: Creatinines elevated 2.2 - 2.7.  Urinary sodium
   18, BUN 80.  Renal following; they spun urine and saw dense and
   multiple granular casts.  Most likely etiology is ATN secondary to
   persistent hypotension.  Is currently anuric and renal feels he has
   poor prognosis for his kidney disease and may take long time for
   resolution given anuria.
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Maintain BPs and perfusion to kidneys, avoid any further hypotension
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   .
   7).  Thrombocytopenia
 Unclear whether at baseline.  Has hx of MDS so
   could have low platelet production.  Platelets relatively stable, INR
   went from 1.3 -> 1.7; no overt evidence of bleeding, smear negative for
   schistos.  Other causes could be secondary to his HAART therapy or
   secondary to underlying sepsis.
   -Check coags tonight
   -Currently not on HAART therapy
   -Trend platelets daily
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -DIC labs if INR continues to climb
   .
   8) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -re-obtain HIV testing tomorrow or obtain from OSH
   -f/u with ID about whether or not can restart HAART therapy
   .
   9) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.  This AM, has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia;
   checking AM cortisol and performing stim test.
   -F/u AM cortisol
   -F/u stim test
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   .
   10) Anion gap and non anion gap metabolic acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2
   is 23.  Etiology of gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic
   acid accumulation (has improved from 5.3 -> 2.9.) Also has renal
   failure on top.  Non-gap acidosis could be secondary to recent
   diarrhea, and if adrenally insufficient, hypoaldosteronism.
   -Trend lactates [**Hospital1 **]
   -Hydration today for further resolution of lactic acidosis
   -f/u stim test
   -f/u renal recs
   .
   11) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -OSH records
   12)FEN - Hydration today (can give NS 150 ccs/hr) for potential
   underlying pancreatitis as well as for lactic acidosis.  Keep NPO
   except meds for bowel rest.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low
   this AM).  K was high, giving kayexelate.
   13)PPX - pneumoboots (thrombocytopenia), ppi

Based on the provided medical note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency. He was transferred to the MICU for hypotension and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated WBC count, bandemia, and hypothermia suggest a severe septic response, which can lead to organ dysfunction, including renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he is anuric, which may indicate acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to persistent hypotension.
3. Hepatic Infarct: The abdominal CT scan shows a wedge-shaped area on the liver, which could be secondary to infarct. This may lead to liver failure and further complicate the patient's condition.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be related to his MDS or HAART therapy. This can increase the risk of bleeding.
5. C. difficile Colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection and is currently receiving antibiotics, which may lead to further complications, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and potentially life-threatening colonic perforation.
6. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated amylase and lipase levels suggest pancreatitis, which can lead to severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's hyponatremia and hyperkalemia suggest adrenal insufficiency, which can lead to cardiovascular instability, hypotension, and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Anion Gap and Non-Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's pH is 7.43, which may indicate metabolic acidosis. The etiology is likely secondary to lactic acid accumulation, which can lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.

To mitigate these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and targeted antibiotic therapy. The patient's treatment plan should also include management of his HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency, as well as ongoing monitoring of his renal function, liver function, and coagulation status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 ACUTE PAIN
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia, complicated by adrenal
   insufficiency.  Sepsis seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC
   count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5), vs adrenal insufficiency
   crisis, less likely given maintenance of BP on minimal pressors.  Has
   h/o C diff at OSH, now s/p tx, repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis and
   prepatellar fluid and edema around left knee that could be possible
   sources.  Bcxs are pending.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Given stability of HCT, started on IV heparin this AM
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics to tap
   joint to ensure not septic knee
   #) L knee swelling tenderness - Pt has full range of motion in knee
   without significant pain or tenderness.  Tap may show mild inflammatory
   fluid.
   - infectious/inflammatory process unlikely given benign nature of exam
   - attempt diagnostic tap
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   Cdiff, coccidio
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - -did have initial crit drop yesterday was
   transfused two units.  Overnight Hct dropped from 29 -> 26.3 yesterday
   - Goal to transfuse is 21
   - NG lavage was deferred yesterday given pt's Hct appeared to be stable
   - Place NG tube, lavage
   - stools are guaic positive, but not bloody
   - f/u hemolysis labs
   4) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.
   -RUQ ultrasound w/ doppler to R/o portal vein thrombosis
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   5) Amylase/lipase elevation - No clinical signs of pancreatitis.
   - RUQ US for evaluation of gallbladder and CBD today
   -IV fluid hydration today
   6) Acute Renal Failure: Creatinines elevated 2.8.  Urinary sodium 18,
   BUN 80.  Renal following; they spun urine and saw dense and multiple
   granular casts.  Most likely etiology is ATN secondary to persistent
   hypotension.  Is currently anuric and renal feels he has poor prognosis
   for his kidney disease and may take long time for resolution given
   anuria.  Try repeat fluid bolus, pt not responding, despite maintenance
   of BP.  ? reduced intravascular volume and high SVR?
   - Maintaining BPs
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Maintain BPs and perfusion to kidneys, avoid any further hypotension
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   7).  Thrombocytopenia
 Unclear whether at baseline.  Has hx of MDS so
   could have low platelet production, but now dropping precipitously to
   27.  INR went from 1.3 -> 2.7, now 2.1; no overt evidence of bleeding,
   although Hct dropping.   Other causes could be secondary to his HAART
   therapy or secondary to underlying sepsis.  Elevated fibrinogen, FDP
   pending.
   - q6 coags and platelets
   -Currently not on HAART therapy
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -f/u DIC labs, seems less likey given elevated fibrinogen
   8) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -obtain HIV testing, VL per ID.  Requires consent.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acut setting
   9) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.  This AM, has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia;
   checking AM cortisol and performing stim test.
   - Maintaining BP which doesn't suggest acute decompensation,  could try
   pulse dose steroids and see if he has improvement.
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   10) Anion gap acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2 is 23.  Etiology of gap
   metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic acid accumulation (has
   improved from 5.3 -> 2.9.) Also has renal failure on top
   - Lactate improving at 1.4
   - f/u renal recs
   11) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -OSH records
   12)FEN - Fluid boluses. NPO until NG lavage.  Replenish electrolytes
   (calcium was low this AM).  K was high, giving kayexelate.
   13)PPX - pneumoboots (thrombocytopenia), ppi
   14) ACCESS
 L IJ
   15) CONTACT - patient, son
   16 )CODE - FULL
   17) DISPO - Pending clinical improvement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, sepsis, and acute renal failure.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT, and a recent LENI (Lower Extremity Nerve Injury) study suggests a superficial femoral vein clot.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a high white blood cell count, bandemia, and hypothermia, which suggests sepsis.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, and his urine output is decreased.
4. Hepatic Infarct: The patient has an abdominal CT scan showing a wedge-shaped area on the liver that could be secondary to infarct.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to MDS, HAART therapy, or sepsis.
6. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient has a metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap, which could be due to lactic acid accumulation.
7. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency, and his cortisol levels are low.
8. HIV: The patient has a new diagnosis of HIV, which is unusual in an 80-year-old man.
9. MDS: The patient has a history of MDS, which could be contributing to his thrombocytopenia and anemia.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis
2. Heparin for DVT prophylaxis
3. IV fluids for hypovolemia
4. NG lavage for gastrointestinal bleeding
5. Transfusions for anemia and thrombocytopenia
6. Corticosteroids for adrenal insufficiency
7. HIV treatment, including antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis
8. Supportive care for sepsis and organ dysfunction

The patient's family has been informed of his condition and treatment plan, and a family meeting has been scheduled for the next day. The patient's code status is full code."

   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   # Acute respiratory decompensation
 likely flash pulmonary edema,
   given chronicity with fluids.  Given 100 mg IV Lasix with poor UOP.
   Will follow and reassess.  Curretnly 100% on CPAP.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia, complicated by adrenal
   insufficiency.  Sepsis seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC
   count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5), vs adrenal insufficiency
   crisis, less likely given maintenance of BP on minimal pressors.  Has
   h/o C diff at OSH, now s/p tx, repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis and
   prepatellar fluid and edema around left knee that could be possible
   sources.  Bcxs are pending.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Given stability of HCT, d/c heparin, start argatroban
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics to tap
   joint to ensure not septic knee
   7).  Thrombocytopenia
 Unclear whether at baseline.  Has hx of MDS so
   could have low platelet production, but now dropping precipitously to
   27.  INR went from 1.3 -> 2.7, now 2.1; no overt evidence of bleeding,
   although Hct dropping.   Other causes could be secondary to his HAART
   therapy or secondary to underlying sepsis.  Elevated fibrinogen, FDP
   pending.   Given possible hypercoagulable state ( wedge shaped liver
   lesion), HIT not an unlikely possibility.
   - q6 coags and platelets
   -Currently not on HAART therapy
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -f/u DIC labs, seems less likey given elevated fibrinogen
   - HIT antibody
   #) L knee swelling tenderness - Pt has full range of motion in knee
   without significant pain or tenderness.  Tap may show mild inflammatory
   fluid.
   - infectious/inflammatory process unlikely given benign nature of exam
   - attempt diagnostic tap
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc

   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   Cdiff, coccidio
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h

   - Goal to transfuse is 21
   - NG lavage was deferred yesterday given pt's Hct appeared to be stable
   - Place NG tube, lavage
   - stools are guaic positive, but not bloody
   4) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.
   -RUQ ultrasound w/ doppler to R/o portal vein thrombosis
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly

   5) Amylase/lipase elevation - No clinical signs of pancreatitis.
   - RUQ US for evaluation of gallbladder and CBD today
   -IV fluid hydration today
   6) Acute Renal Failure: Creatinines elevated 2.8.  Urinary sodium 18,
   BUN 80.  Renal following; they spun urine and saw dense and multiple
   granular casts.  Most likely etiology is ATN secondary to persistent
   hypotension.  Is currently anuric and renal feels he has poor prognosis

   flow, NRB, and finally CPAP.  O2 sat picked up.  Stat CXR pending.
   - Pt started on heparin - PTT supratherapeutic, held
   - AM cortisol 2.5 --> 8.9 with cosyntropin
   - Stool studies negative for O&P, Cryptosporidia, Giardia, Cdiff
   - PM Hct stable, no NG lavage performed
   - renal: no need for HD yet, d/w family goals of care before more
   aggresive tx.  check vanco trough before next dose
   - ID: check stool for Cdiff x2.  consider surgical c/s.  Continue po
   vanc/flayl.  If Cdiff negtive, consider other etiology of leukocy tosis
   such as MDS w/ transformation.  keep off HAART while acutely ill.
   - PM lactate 1.9
   - INR bumped to 2.7, Plts dropped to 37.  Added on FDP and Fibrinogen
   for ? DIC.
   - Family Meeting set for 2pm tomorrow.
   - weaping from all openings in his skin
   - repeat knee exam showed edema, and ? tenderness to palpation.  He has
   full range of motion, which does not appear painful.

 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 ACUTE PAIN
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   # Acute respiratory decompensation
 likely flash pulmonary edema,
   given chronicity with fluids.  Given 100 mg IV Lasix with poor UOP.
   Will follow and reassess.  Curretnly 100% on CPAP.
   1) Hypotension: Sepsis vs hypovolemia, complicated by adrenal
   insufficiency.  Sepsis seems most likely given markedly elevated WBC
   count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5), vs adrenal insufficiency
   crisis, less likely given maintenance of BP on minimal pressors.  Has
   h/o C diff at OSH, now s/p tx, repeat C diff toxin here negative.  Does
   have tender and erythematous skin along left groin/thigh and behind
   left knee that could be secondary to skin infection/cellulitis and
   prepatellar fluid and edema around left knee that could be possible
   sources.  Bcxs are pending.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u culture data: C diff negative, other stool studies pending.  Bcxs
   pending. CT suggestive of sigmoiditis but no other clear infectious
   sources/abscesses/fluid collections.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   Also on IV flagyl given recent hx of c diff
   -UNa < 20, suggestive of some hypovolemia; boluses with fluids today
   and follow UOP.
   2) Left leg swelling/tenderness - Obtained LENI yesterday suggestive of
   superficial femoral vein clot, suggestive of DVT.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Could also be responsible for inflammatory rxn resulting in
   hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -Given stability of HCT, d/c heparin, start argatroban
   -Possibly has inflammatory left knee given tenderness on movement,
   prepatellar effusion, could consider consulting orthopedics to tap
   joint to ensure not septic knee
   7).  Thrombocytopenia
 Unclear whether at baseline.  Has hx of MDS so
   could have low platelet production, but now dropping precipitously to
   27.  INR went from 1.3 -> 2.7, now 2.1; no overt evidence of bleeding,
   although Hct dropping.   Other causes could be secondary to his HAART
   therapy or secondary to underlying sepsis.  Elevated fibrinogen, FDP
   pending.   Given possible hypercoagulable state ( wedge shaped liver
   lesion), HIT not an unlikely possibility.
   - q6 coags and platelets
   -Currently not on HAART therapy
   -Obtain OSH
   -Smear for schistos to rule out [**Doctor First Name 2079**]
   -f/u DIC labs, seems less likey given elevated fibrinogen
   - HIT antibody
   #) L knee swelling tenderness - Pt has full range of motion in knee
   without significant pain or tenderness.  Tap may show mild inflammatory
   fluid.
   - infectious/inflammatory process unlikely given benign nature of exam
   - attempt diagnostic tap
   3) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   Cdiff, coccidio
   - Continue Vancomycin 125 mg PO q6h
   - Vancomycin 500 mg IV Q8hr
   - IV flagyl
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - -did have initial crit drop yesterday was
   transfused two units.  Overnight Hct dropped from 29 -> 26.3 yesterday
   - Goal to transfuse is 21
   - NG lavage was deferred yesterday given pt's Hct appeared to be stable
   - Place NG tube, lavage
   - stools are guaic positive, but not bloody
   4) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.
   -RUQ ultrasound w/ doppler to R/o portal vein thrombosis
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   5) Amylase/lipase elevation - No clinical signs of pancreatitis.
   - RUQ US for evaluation of gallbladder and CBD today
   -IV fluid hydration today
   6) Acute Renal Failure: Creatinines elevated 2.8.  Urinary sodium 18,
   BUN 80.  Renal following; they spun urine and saw dense and multiple
   granular casts.  Most likely etiology is ATN secondary to persistent
   hypotension.  Is currently anuric and renal feels he has poor prognosis
   for his kidney disease and may take long time for resolution given
   anuria.  Try repeat fluid bolus, pt not responding, despite maintenance
   of BP.  ? reduced intravascular volume and high SVR?
   - Maintaining BPs
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Maintain BPs and perfusion to kidneys, avoid any further hypotension
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   8) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   -obtain HIV testing, VL per ID.  Requires consent.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acut setting
   9) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.  This AM, has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia;
   checking AM cortisol and performing stim test.
   - Maintaining BP which doesn't suggest acute decompensation,  could try
   pulse dose steroids and see if he has improvement.
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   10) Anion gap acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2 is 23.  Etiology of gap
   metabolic acidosis likely secondary to lactic acid accumulation (has
   improved from 5.3 -> 2.9.) Also has renal failure on top
   - Lactate improving at 1.4
   - f/u renal recs
   11) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -OSH records
   12)FEN - NPO until NG lavage.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low
   this AM).  K was high, giving kayexelate.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and has since developed several complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of MDS, which increases his risk of developing DVT. The presence of a superficial femoral vein clot on the left leg suggests that he may have a provoked DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism if left untreated.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and hypothermia suggest that he may be septic. The source of the infection is unclear, but the patient's history of C. difficile colitis and the presence of erythematous skin lesions along the left groin/thigh and behind the left knee suggest that he may have a skin infection or cellulitis.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels, decreased urine output, and presence of granular casts in his urine suggest that he may have AKI. The etiology of his AKI is unclear, but it may be related to his sepsis, hypotension, or underlying kidney disease.
4. Hepatic Infarct: The patient's abdominal CT scan shows a wedge-shaped area on his liver that could be secondary to infarct. The presence of DVT and ischemic colitis suggests that he may have a hypercoagulable state, which could increase his risk of developing a hepatic infarct.
5. Amylase/Lipase Elevation: The patient's elevated amylase and lipase levels suggest that he may have pancreatitis. However, the lack of clinical signs of pancreatitis and the presence of other comorbidities make it unclear whether this is the primary cause of his elevated enzyme levels.
6. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient's elevated anion gap and metabolic acidosis suggest that he may have a metabolic disorder. The etiology of his anion gap acidosis is unclear, but it may be related to his lactic acid accumulation, renal failure, or other underlying conditions.
7. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's history of adrenal insufficiency and his current presentation with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia suggest that he may be experiencing adrenal insufficiency. The patient's cortisol levels are low, and he may require treatment with steroids to stabilize his condition.
8. HIV: The patient's new diagnosis of HIV and his history of HAART therapy suggest that he may have a complicated HIV infection. The patient's CD4 count is 250, which is relatively high for an 81-year-old man, and he may require treatment with antiretroviral therapy to manage his HIV infection.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. The patient's family should be educated on his condition and treatment plan, and the patient should be referred to a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers for further management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, C. Diff, lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and hypotension. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, acute renal failure, and hypoxemia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Heart rate: 76 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 110/unknown mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 4 mmHg, total in 1,359 mL, total out 120 mL

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 31.4-45.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 65-27 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.3-2.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.04-0.05 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* LDH: 450 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.5 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.9 mg/dL
* PO4: 5.9 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremity
* Acute pain
* Impaired skin integrity
* Renal failure, acute (ARF)
* Sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction)
* Hypoxemic respiratory failure
* C. Diff infection
* HIV
* Liver lesion (wedge-shaped, possibly infarct or metastatic lesion)
* Pancreatitis (with decreasing amylase and lipase levels)
* Anemia (with decreasing hemoglobin level)

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Treatment of septic shock with vancomycin and cefepime
* Management of hypoxemic respiratory failure with CPAP
* Treatment of C. Diff infection with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole
* Management of DVT with argatroban and further evaluation for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
* Off ARVs for now
* Further evaluation of liver lesion with RUQ ultrasound
* Continued management of renal failure
* Follow-up of pancreatitis with decreasing amylase and lipase levels
* Transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells
* Family meeting scheduled for today

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further deterioration of respiratory function
* Progression of septic shock
* Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia
* Further decline in renal function
* Development of hepatic failure
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression
* Development of acute pancreatitis

In conclusion, the patient is critically ill with multiple complex medical conditions, and his condition requires close monitoring and management in the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old man with a complex medical condition, including:

1. Shock: The patient is hypotensive, with a blood pressure of 110/ unknown mmHg, and has a history of septic shock.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, with minimal urine output, and is requiring dialysis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure, with a SpO2 of 96% on CPAP, and is requiring mechanical ventilation.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a lower extremity DVT, which is a potential source of embolism.
5. C. difficile (C. Diff) infection: The patient has a C. Diff infection, which is being treated with vancomycin and metronidazole.
6. Liver lesion: The patient has a wedge-shaped liver lesion, which may be an infarct or a metastatic lesion.
7. HIV: The patient is newly diagnosed with HIV, and is off antiretroviral therapy (ART) for now.
8. Anemia: The patient has anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.7 g/dL, and is receiving blood transfusions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further deterioration of renal function, leading to worsening acidosis and electrolyte imbalances.
2. Development of respiratory failure, leading to increased oxygen requirements and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Embolism from the DVT, leading to further organ dysfunction or death.
4. Infection from the C. Diff infection, leading to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
5. Progression of the liver lesion, leading to liver failure or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
6. Development of pancreatitis, leading to further organ dysfunction and potential need for surgical intervention.
7. Worsening of anemia, leading to further organ dysfunction and potential need for transfusions.

The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and improve outcomes."

 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 ACUTE PAIN
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
    # Acute respiratory decompensation
 currently requiring respiratory
   support with CPAP to maintain oxygenation.  Ddx includes flash
   pulmonary edema, atelectasis/lung collapse, PNA, and PE particularly
   given concern for possible  hypercoagulability with HIT.  CXR
   supporting pna, or possible lung collapse.  RLL effusion also possible,
   consistent with u/s read.
   - 7.28 19 171 9  consistent with hyperventilation due to metabolic
   acidosis.  oxygenating well.
   - evluate for pulm edema - ECHO pending, not responding to lasix, but
   also not makign significant urine.
   - CXR this AM shows RLL opacity possible effusion, collapse, pna.
   Still no sputum culture obtained.
   - family wanted dialysis - - line placement today
   #) Hypotension: Mostly resolved.  Most likely due to sepsis given lack
   of response to volume.  Pt also has markedly elevated WBC count w/
   bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  Adrenal crisis, less likely given
   maintenance of BP on minimal pressors.  Cdiff negative X3.  Possible
   pneumonia per CXR, possible cellulitis on LLE.  CT suggestive of
   sigmoiditis, but no other clear infectious sources.   Bcxs NGTD.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u culture data
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   - d/c IV flagyl and po vanco given neg Cdiff.
   - avoid volume given ? CHF, and pt anuric.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -On argatroban for ? HIT
   #).  Thrombocytopenia
 Has hx of MDS,  but platelets dropped
   preciptiously to the 20s - 30s.   INR went from 1.3 -> 2.7; no overt
   evidence of bleeding, although Hct dropping.   Other causes could be
   secondary to his HAART therapy or secondary to underlying sepsis.
   Elevated fibrinogen, FDP pending.   Given possible hypercoagulable
   state ( wedge shaped liver lesion), HIT not an unlikely possibility.
   - q6 coags and platelets
   -Obtain OSH records
   -f/u DIC labs, seems less likey given elevated fibrinogen
   - HIT antibody pending
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - -did have initial crit drop yesterday was
   transfused two units.  Stable at 29-30 since.
   - Goal to transfuse is 21
   - PM Hct stable
   - stools are guaic positive, but not bloody
   - Hemolysis labs: Elevated LDH and Tbili, normal hapto, no shistocytes
   -> low probability of hemolysis
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.
   - Maintaining BPs
   -Strict Is and Os
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   -F/u renal recs today
   - line placement likely today, will have to hold argatroban.  Give FFP
   and platelets.  ?Plt shortage.
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250.  No known VL and no HIV testing here.
   - VL/CD4 pending.  Requires consent.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acut setting
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   Cdiff, coccidio
   - Cdiff negative
   - f/u O&P
   #) L knee swelling tenderness - Pt has full range of motion in knee
   without significant pain or tenderness.  Tap may show mild inflammatory
   fluid.
   - infectious/inflammatory process unlikely given benign nature of exam
   - attempt diagnostic tap
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and
   ?ischemic colitis, question of hypercoagulability.   RUQ u/s: Patent
   and appropriate hepatic vasculature, No gallstones and no signs of
   cholecystitis.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Amylase/lipase elevation - No clinical signs of pancreatitis.  RUQ
   US clear.
   - no need to follow lipase and amylase
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - Maintaining BP which doesn't suggest acute decompensation,  could try
   pulse dose steroids and see if he has improvement.
   -Continue home dexamethasone 1 mg IV Q6 hr.
   #) Anion gap acidosis.  pH is 7.43.  pCO2 is 23.  Etiology of gap
   metabolic acidosis likely secondary to renal failure.  (Initially also
   due to lactic acid which has now improved)
   - f/u renal recs
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -OSH records
   #)FEN -  Speech and swallow deferred as pt on CPAP.  Replenish
   electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - pneumoboots (thrombocytopenia), ppi
   #) ACCESS
 L IJ
   #) CONTACT - patient, son
   # )CODE - FULL
    #) DISPO - Pending clinical improvement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory decompensation, hypotension, and sepsis. He has a history of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency. The patient is currently requiring respiratory support with CPAP to maintain oxygenation. He has a DVT in the superficial femoral vein and is at risk for pulmonary embolism. The patient has acute renal failure, anuria, and is at risk for further decline in renal function. He also has thrombocytopenia and is at risk for bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's DVT and history of MDS increase his risk for pulmonary embolism, which could be life-threatening.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is severe and could lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular instability.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely to worsen if not managed aggressively, leading to further decline in renal function and increased risk of cardiovascular complications.
4. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and history of MDS increase his risk for bleeding, which could be life-threatening.
5. Infection: The patient's sepsis and history of MDS increase his risk for infection, which could lead to further decline in his condition.
6. Liver Failure: The patient's wedge-shaped liver lesion and history of MDS increase his risk for liver failure, which could lead to further decline in his condition.
7. Cardiovascular Instability: The patient's hypotension and history of adrenal insufficiency increase his risk for cardiovascular instability, which could lead to further decline in his condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygenation and ventilation closely to prevent further decline in respiratory function.
2. Aggressively manage the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and fluids to prevent further decline in his condition.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider dialysis if necessary to prevent further decline in renal function.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count closely and consider platelet transfusions if necessary to prevent bleeding.
5. Consider anticoagulation therapy to prevent further thrombotic events.
6. Monitor the patient's liver function closely and consider liver transplantation if necessary to prevent further decline in liver function.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular function closely and consider cardiovascular support if necessary to prevent further decline in cardiovascular function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   function is normal (LVEF>55%). The right ventricular free wall is
   hypertrophied. with normal free wall contractility. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. No mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is an anterior space

    # Acute respiratory decompensation
 currently requiring respiratory
   support with CPAP to maintain oxygenation.  Ddx includes flash
   pulmonary edema, atelectasis/lung collapse, PNA, and PE particularly
   given concern for possible  hypercoagulability with HIT.  CXR
   supporting pna, or possible lung collapse.  RLL effusion also possible,
   consistent with u/s read.
   - 7.28 19 171 9  consistent with hyperventilation due to metabolic
   acidosis.  oxygenating well.
   - evluate for pulm edema
 ECHO unremarkable, not responding to lasix,
   but also not makign significant urine.
   - CXR this AM shows RLL opacity possible effusion, collapse, pna.
   Still no sputum culture obtained.
   - family wanted dialysis -  line placement today
   #) Hypotension: Mostly resolved.  Most likely due to sepsis given lack
   of response to volume.  Pt also has markedly elevated WBC count w/
   bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).  Adrenal crisis, less likely given
   maintenance of BP on minimal pressors.  Cdiff negative X3.  Possible
   pneumonia per CXR, possible cellulitis on LLE.  CT suggestive of
   sigmoiditis, but no other clear infectious sources.   Bcxs NGTD.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u culture data
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given that no known source.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for Cdiff.
   - avoid volume given ? CHF, and pt anuric.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -On argatroban for ? HIT
   #).  Thrombocytopenia
 Has hx of MDS,  but platelets dropped
   preciptiously to the 20s - 30s.   INR went from 1.3 -> 2.7; no overt
   evidence of bleeding, although Hct dropping.   Other causes could be
   secondary to his HAART therapy or secondary to underlying sepsis.
   Elevated fibrinogen, FDP pending.   Given possible hypercoagulable
   state ( wedge shaped liver lesion), HIT not an unlikely possibility.
   - [**Hospital1 **]  coags and platelets

   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although

   that could be secondary to infarct.  Difficult to infarct liver given 2
   circulations but could be secondary to embolic event.  Given DVT and

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory decompensation, requiring CPAP support to maintain oxygenation. He has a history of C. difficile colitis, and his recent laboratory results show a severe anion gap acidosis, likely secondary to renal failure. He also has thrombocytopenia, which may be related to his MDS or underlying sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory decompensation and requirement for CPAP support increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, bandemia, and hypothermia suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is at risk for further thrombotic events.
4. Renal failure: The patient's anion gap acidosis and acute renal failure increase the risk of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
5. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia and history of MDS increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Hepatic infarct: The patient's abdominal CT scan shows a wedge-shaped area on the liver that could be secondary to infarct.
7. Pancreatitis: The patient's amylase and lipase elevation suggest pancreatitis, which can lead to severe complications if left untreated.
8. Adrenal crisis: The patient's history of adrenal insufficiency and recent laboratory results suggest adrenal crisis, which can lead to cardiovascular collapse and death.
9. HIV-related complications: The patient's new diagnosis of HIV increases the risk of opportunistic infections and HIV-related complications.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or promptly address potential medical complications."

 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   81 yo man with new diagnosis of HIV, C.Diff, LLE DVT, hypotension.  Now
   with worsening renal failure and acidosis, hypoxemia in setting of
   anuria.
   1. Hypotension/Septic shock: Cont vanc/cefepime.  No specific source
   identified other than known c. diff from osh.  No positive C. diff
   here.  Will increase steroids to stress dose.
   2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Will elect to intubate given
   declining respiratory status.  Have discussed with the son this morning
   who wants to pursue agressive measures for now
   3. C.Diff: po vanc/iv flagyl.
   4. LLE DVT: Cont aragatroban. PTT supratherapeutic.  HIT pending -
   platelets stable
   5. HIV: Off ARVs for now.  Start Bactrim ppx.
   6. Liver lesion: Wedge shaped - possible infarct but would be rare for
   liver.  Could also be some metastatic lesion.  RUQ ultrasound today
   7. Renal failure: Will need HD line to initiiate HD - needs reversal of
   coagulopathy/argatroban/platelets from line placement
   8. Anemia: Hct stable.
   Will continue to discuss goals of care with the family.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical condition, including respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. The patient has a history of HIV, C. diff, and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern and requires non-invasive ventilation (NIPPV). His oxygen saturation is 100%, and his ABG shows a pH of 7.34, PaO2 of 340, and PaCO2 of 19.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 2.9 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 31 mg/dL. He has anuria and requires hemodialysis.
3. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, and his lactate level is 1.3 mmol/L.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 110/0 mmHg, and he requires vasopressors to maintain his blood pressure.
5. DVT: The patient has a lower extremity DVT, and his PTT is supratherapeutic. He is receiving argatroban therapy.
6. HIV: The patient has a new diagnosis of HIV, and his CD4 count is 13.4 K/uL.
7. C. diff: The patient has C. diff colitis, and he is receiving vancomycin and metronidazole therapy.
8. Liver lesion: The patient has a wedge-shaped liver lesion, which could be an infarct or a metastatic lesion. He is scheduled for a RUQ ultrasound.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Hypotension/septic shock: The patient will continue to receive vancomycin and cefepime therapy. He will also receive stress dose steroids.
2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient will be intubated and mechanically ventilated.
3. C. diff: The patient will continue to receive vancomycin and metronidazole therapy.
4. LLE DVT: The patient will continue to receive argatroban therapy.
5. HIV: The patient will start Bactrim prophylaxis.
6. Liver lesion: The patient will undergo further evaluation and management.
7. Renal failure: The patient will require hemodialysis, and his coagulopathy will need to be reversed before line placement.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, and he will continue to receive blood transfusions as needed.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Further deterioration of the patient's respiratory status, leading to the need for more aggressive respiratory support.
2. Progression of the patient's sepsis, leading to multi-organ failure.
3. Development of acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening of his current renal failure.
4. Hemorrhage or bleeding complications due to his coagulopathy.
5. Infection or sepsis related to his central lines or other invasive devices.
6. Further decline in his liver function, leading to liver failure.
7. Development of other complications related to his HIV infection, such as opportunistic infections or malignancies.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and multiple organ dysfunction, it is essential to continue to monitor his condition closely and adjust his therapy as needed to prevent further complications and improve his outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
    # Acute respiratory decompensation
 currently requiring respiratory
   support with ASSIST w/ FiO2 40% and PEEP of 8.  Likely multifactorial
   secondary to atelectasis  vs respiratory distress in setting of
   tachypnea from metabolic acidosis versus pulmonary edema.  Pneumonia
   less likely as CXR  not supportive of this dx.
   - Oxygenating well on current settings w/ most recent gas of 7.45, 25,
   191.  Maintaining current settings given tenuous status.
   - F/u sputum cxs; given CD4 is 40, elevated D-dimer, would also test
   sputum for PCP; also consider testing for MAC given low CD4.
   -Clinically does appear mildly volume overloaded esp in setting of
   receiving fluids and multiple products w/o making urine although CXR
   does not show sig edema: was +2 L yesterday.   [**Month (only) 8**] go for dialysis
   today and would try to take off -2L to make net balance 0.
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, less likely given maintenance of BP on minimal
   pressors.   Less likely hypovolemia given poor repsonse to fluids.  In
   terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **] negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT
   suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,
   possible pneumonia per CXR.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   4.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   # Thrombocytopenia - Platelets falling from 60 -> 11, responded to
   transfusion w/ platelets currently at 110.   Differential dx is broad
   but etiologies we should consider include:  DIC vs  worsening HIV
   infection (CD4 fallen from 250 -> 40 in last month) vs hep C induced
   thrombocytopenia vs ITP vs TTP vs HIT.   DIC is possible in setting of
   underlying sepsis, especially since concomittant HCT drop, elevated
   D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and rising INR; made less likely by
   abscence of schistocytes on smear.  HIV can directly damage platelets
   and may have recently worsened w/ recent CD4 drop over past month; both
   HIV and hep C can also induce an ITP.  TTP possible given renal
   failure, mental status change, hypothermia, thrombocytopenia and
   anemia, but made less likely by abscence of schistocytes.  HIT unlikely
   given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   -Would obtain heme-consult for better eval of peripheral smear
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   .
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   .
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT fell from 26 to 22 overnight.  Has had
   guiaic positive stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   Received 1 Unit this AM
   -Would follow HCTs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Tranfusion goal is 21
   -Prior hemolysis labs have been negative but would repeat hemolysis
   labs today (can add on to AM labs) Tbili, hapto; f/u peripheral smear.
   .
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.
   -Check cryoglobulins, C3, C4 levels, and ANCA.
   - Strict Is and Os
   - Went for HD line placement yesterday; touch base w/ renal about
   possibility of HD today.
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting (discuss w/ ID re: starting
   HAART esp as could be related to thrombocytopenia)
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and checking for G6PD deficiency prior to starting dapsone for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   [**Doctor First Name **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Raises question of
   hypercoagulability.  Stable.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - strt stress dose steroids
   #) Gap Metabolic acidosis - Likely secondary to renal failure.
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Make this a priority: obtaining OSH records.  Someone should call and
   follow this up, this AM.
   #)FEN -  Speech and swallow deferred as pt on CPAP.  Replenish
   electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - PPI; can restart on subq heparin.
   #) ACCESS
 L IJ , HD line, peripherals
   #) CONTACT - patient, son
   # )CODE - FULL
    #) DISPO - Pending clinical improvement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   [**Doctor First Name **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications are potential concerns:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on respiratory support with ASSIST and FiO2 40%, and is likely to require continued mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a high white blood cell count, bandemia, and hypothermia, which suggests an underlying septic process.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has fallen from 60 to 11, and is likely due to sepsis, HIV infection, or hep C-induced thrombocytopenia.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient is anuric and has acute hypotensive insult to the kidneys with low reserve, which may be due to ATN or hep C-related vasculitis.
5. HIV: The patient has a new diagnosis of HIV, which is unusual in an 80+ year old man.
6. C. difficile colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile being treated with vancomycin and metronidazole, and has continued diarrhea on arrival to the ICU.
7. Hepatic infarct: The patient's abdominal CT reveals a wedge-shaped area on the liver that could be secondary to infarct, which raises concerns about hypercoagulability.
8. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's history is unclear, and the patient may require stress dose steroids.
9. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a gap metabolic acidosis that is likely secondary to renal failure.
10. MDS: The patient has a diagnosis of MDS, which may require transfusions PRN.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
    # Acute respiratory decompensation
 currently requiring respiratory
   support with ASSIST w/ FiO2 40% and PEEP of 8.  Likely multifactorial
   secondary to atelectasis  vs respiratory distress in setting of
   tachypnea from metabolic acidosis versus pulmonary edema.  Pneumonia
   less likely as CXR  not supportive of this dx.
   - Oxygenating well on current settings w/ most recent gas of 7.45, 25,
   191.  Maintaining current settings given tenuous status.
   - F/u sputum cxs; given CD4 is 40, elevated D-dimer, would also test
   sputum for PCP; also consider testing for MAC given low CD4.
   -Clinically does appear mildly volume overloaded esp in setting of
   receiving fluids and multiple products w/o making urine although CXR
   does not show sig edema: was +2 L yesterday.   [**Month (only) 8**] go for dialysis
   today and would try to take off -2L to make net balance 0.
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, less likely given maintenance of BP on minimal
   pressors.   Less likely hypovolemia given poor repsonse to fluids.  In
   terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **] negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT
   suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,
   possible pneumonia per CXR.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   4.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   # Thrombocytopenia - Platelets falling from 60 -> 11, responded to
   transfusion w/ platelets currently at 110.   Differential dx is broad
   but etiologies we should consider include:  DIC vs  worsening HIV
   infection (CD4 fallen from 250 -> 40 in last month) vs hep C induced
   thrombocytopenia vs ITP vs TTP vs HIT.   DIC is possible in setting of
   underlying sepsis, especially since concomittant HCT drop, elevated
   D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and rising INR; made less likely by
   abscence of schistocytes on smear.  HIV can directly damage platelets
   and may have recently worsened w/ recent CD4 drop over past month; both
   HIV and hep C can also induce an ITP.  TTP possible given renal
   failure, mental status change, hypothermia, thrombocytopenia and
   anemia, but made less likely by abscence of schistocytes.  HIT unlikely
   given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   -Would obtain heme-consult for better eval of peripheral smear
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   .
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   .
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT fell from 26 to 22 overnight.  Has had
   guiaic positive stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   Received 1 Unit this AM
   -Would follow HCTs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Tranfusion goal is 21
   -Prior hemolysis labs have been negative but would repeat hemolysis
   labs today (can add on to AM labs) Tbili, hapto; f/u peripheral smear.
   .
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.
   -Check cryoglobulins, C3, C4 levels, and ANCA.
   - Strict Is and Os
   - Went for HD line placement yesterday; touch base w/ renal about
   possibility of HD today.
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting (discuss w/ ID re: starting
   HAART esp as could be related to thrombocytopenia)
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and checking for G6PD deficiency prior to starting dapsone for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   [**Doctor First Name **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Raises question of
   hypercoagulability.  Stable.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - strt stress dose steroids
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can
   obtain CT head
   -F/u smear
   #) Gap Metabolic acidosis - Likely secondary to renal failure.
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Make this a priority: obtaining OSH records.  Someone should call and
   follow this up, this AM.
   #)FEN -  Speech and swallow deferred as pt on CPAP.  Replenish
   electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - PPI; can restart on subq heparin.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
    # Acute respiratory decompensation
 currently requiring respiratory
   support with ASSIST w/ FiO2 40% and PEEP of 8.  Likely multifactorial
   secondary to atelectasis  vs respiratory distress in setting of
   tachypnea from metabolic acidosis versus pulmonary edema.  Pneumonia
   less likely as CXR  not supportive of this dx.
   - Oxygenating well on current settings w/ most recent gas of 7.45, 25,
   191.  Maintaining current settings given tenuous status.
   - F/u sputum cxs; given CD4 is 40, elevated D-dimer, would also test
   sputum for PCP; also consider testing for MAC given low CD4.
   -Clinically does appear mildly volume overloaded esp in setting of
   receiving fluids and multiple products w/o making urine although CXR
   does not show sig edema: was +2 L yesterday.   [**Month (only) 8**] go for dialysis
   today and would try to take off -2L to make net balance 0.
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, less likely given maintenance of BP on minimal
   pressors.   Less likely hypovolemia given poor repsonse to fluids.  In
   terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **] negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT
   suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,
   possible pneumonia per CXR.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   -On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   4.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   # Thrombocytopenia - Platelets falling from 60 -> 11, responded to
   transfusion w/ platelets currently at 110.   Differential dx is broad
   but etiologies we should consider include:  DIC vs  worsening HIV
   infection (CD4 fallen from 250 -> 40 in last month) vs hep C induced
   thrombocytopenia vs ITP vs TTP vs HIT.   DIC is possible in setting of
   underlying sepsis, especially since concomittant HCT drop, elevated
   D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and rising INR; made less likely by
   abscence of schistocytes on smear.  HIV can directly damage platelets
   and may have recently worsened w/ recent CD4 drop over past month; both
   HIV and hep C can also induce an ITP.  TTP possible given renal
   failure, mental status change, hypothermia, thrombocytopenia and
   anemia, but made less likely by abscence of schistocytes.  HIT unlikely
   given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   -Would obtain heme-consult for better eval of peripheral smear
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   .
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   .
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT fell from 26 to 22 overnight.  Has had
   guiaic positive stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   Received 1 Unit this AM
   -Would follow HCTs [**Hospital1 **]
   - Tranfusion goal is 21
   -Prior hemolysis labs have been negative but would repeat hemolysis
   labs today (can add on to AM labs) Tbili, hapto; f/u peripheral smear.
   .
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.
   -Check cryoglobulins, C3, C4 levels, and ANCA.
   - Strict Is and Os
   - Went for HD line placement yesterday; touch base w/ renal about
   possibility of HD today.
   -Trend Cr, Avoid nephrotoxins
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting (discuss w/ ID re: starting
   HAART esp as could be related to thrombocytopenia)
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and checking for G6PD deficiency prior to starting dapsone for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Given HIV concerned for other causes of chronic diarrhea
   like parasites, [**Doctor First Name **], etc
. thought CD4 likely too high for [**Doctor First Name **].
   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
   Would also consider ischemic etiologies given elevated lactate although
   lactate has been trending down.  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia,
   [**Doctor First Name **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  Raises question of
   hypercoagulability.  Stable.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - strt stress dose steroids
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can
   obtain CT head
   -F/u smear
   #) Gap Metabolic acidosis - Likely secondary to renal failure.
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Make this a priority: obtaining OSH records.  Someone should call and
   follow this up, this AM.
   #)FEN -  Speech and swallow deferred as pt on CPAP.  Replenish
   electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - PPI; can restart on subq heparin.
   #) ACCESS
 L IJ , HD line, peripherals
   #) CONTACT - patient, son
   # )CODE - FULL
    #) DISPO - Pending clinical improvement.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency, who was transferred to the ICU for hypotension. He is currently intubated and requiring respiratory support with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 8. He has acute respiratory decompensation, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, DVT, and acute renal failure. He also has a history of C. difficile colitis, and recent diagnoses of HIV and MDS.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia: given the patient's history of HIV and MDS, pneumonia is a possibility, especially with the presence of fever and leukocytosis.
	* Atelectasis: given the patient's respiratory distress and history of chronic lung disease, atelectasis is a possibility.
2. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Sepsis: given the patient's history of sepsis, it is possible that he may develop septic shock.
	* Hypotension: given the patient's history of hypotension, it is possible that he may develop further hypotension.
3. Hematological Complications:
	* Thrombocytopenia: given the patient's history of thrombocytopenia, it is possible that he may develop further thrombocytopenia.
	* DIC: given the patient's history of sepsis and thrombocytopenia, it is possible that he may develop disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Renal Complications:
	* Acute Renal Failure: given the patient's history of acute renal failure, it is possible that he may develop further renal failure.
	* Chronic Kidney Disease: given the patient's history of chronic kidney disease, it is possible that he may develop further chronic kidney disease.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* C. difficile Colitis: given the patient's history of C. difficile colitis, it is possible that he may develop further colitis.
	* Hepatic Infarct: given the patient's history of abdominal CT showing wedge-shaped area on liver, it is possible that he may develop further liver damage.
6. Infectious Complications:
	* Pneumonia: given the patient's history of HIV and MDS, pneumonia is a possibility.
	* Sepsis: given the patient's history of sepsis, it is possible that he may develop septic shock.
7. Neurological Complications:
	* Acute Mental Status Change: given the patient's history of acute mental status change, it is possible that he may develop further neurological compromise.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to monitor him closely for any signs of deterioration and to adjust his treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and requirement for vasopressors indicate ongoing septic shock. If not managed effectively, this can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is severe, with a need for mechanical ventilation and high PEEP levels. Prolonged mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, tracheal stenosis, and lung injury.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure is worsening, and he requires CRRT. If not managed effectively, this can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of infection.
4. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is severe, with organ dysfunction and a high risk of mortality. If not managed effectively, this can lead to multi-organ failure and death.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a DVT in his lower extremity, which increases his risk of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis-related complications.
6. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia is severe, with low counts of all blood cell lines. This increases his risk of bleeding, infection, and multi-organ failure.
7. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV infection can increase his risk of opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and Kaposi's sarcoma.
8. C. difficile infection: The patient's C. difficile infection can lead to severe diarrhea, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of mortality.
9. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver dysfunction can lead to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and increased risk of mortality.
10. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and poor responsiveness increase his risk of neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, and brain death.

Given the patient's critical illness and multiple organ dysfunction, it is essential to closely monitor his condition and manage his care aggressively to prevent further complications and improve his chances of recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, renal failure, and septic shock. He was intubated yesterday and is currently receiving invasive ventilation, CRRT, and transfusions. He has a history of HIV, C. Diff, and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is experiencing worsening renal failure and acidosis, hypoxemia, and anuria. His vital signs are stable, but he has a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 52 bpm, and blood pressure of 110/ unknown mmHg. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased hemoglobin and platelet count.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's septic shock and organ dysfunction may lead to further deterioration of his respiratory, renal, and cardiovascular function.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to his hypoxemia and acidosis, which may require increased ventilator support and potential tracheostomy.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed properly, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and anemia.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's DVT may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) if not treated promptly, which may worsen his respiratory failure and mortality.
5. C. Diff colitis: The patient's C. Diff infection may worsen if not treated effectively, leading to further gastrointestinal symptoms, electrolyte imbalances, and sepsis.
6. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV infection may lead to opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, if not managed properly.
7. Pancytopenia: The patient's pancytopenia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased risk of bleeding, infection, and sepsis.
8. Liver lesion: The patient's liver lesion may be related to his HIV infection and may worsen if not managed properly, leading to liver failure and mortality.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely.
2. Adjust ventilator settings and oxygen therapy as needed to optimize the patient's respiratory function.
3. Manage the patient's septic shock and organ dysfunction with antibiotics, vasopressors, and stress dose steroids.
4. Continue CRRT and consider converting to hemodialysis if the patient's renal function does not improve.
5. Manage the patient's DVT with anticoagulation therapy and consider thrombolytic therapy if the patient's condition worsens.
6. Treat the patient's C. Diff infection with antibiotics and consider probiotics to prevent recurrent infection.
7. Manage the patient's HIV infection with antiretroviral therapy and consider prophylactic therapy for opportunistic infections.
8. Monitor the patient's pancytopenia and consider transfusions if necessary.
9. Evaluate the patient's liver lesion with imaging studies and consider liver function tests to monitor for liver failure.
10. Consider involving a multidisciplinary team, including infectious disease, nephrology, and pulmonology specialists, to optimize the patient's care."

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
 DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS (DVT), LOWER EXTREMITY
 ACUTE PAIN
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   # Acute respiratory decompensation
 Respiratory status has remained
   stable after lung collapse and bronchoscopy yesterday.  Interfering
   with respiratory failure are volume overload and mental status.
   Pneumonia less likely as CXR  not supportive of this, however will keep
   ddx broad given dx of HIV.
   - no plan for weaning today
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, he has recently been maintaining BP on minimal
   pressors.  Now worsening.  In terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **]
   negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other
   possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,  possible pneumonia.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   - On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   5.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   - hold CVVH
   # Thrombocytopenia - Pt had episode of acute thrombocytosis with nadir
   of 11, improved with transfusion.  Differential dx  includes:  DIC
   which is very likely.  Drug reaction, HAART Tx, Hep C induced, ITP.
   DIC is possible in setting of underlying sepsis, especially since
   concomittant HCT drop, elevated D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and
   rising INR, elevated fibrinogen.   Have not seen schistocytes on
   smear.  HIT unlikely given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   - c/s Heme onc - eval of peripheral smear, smear result not documented
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   - Heparin on hold given therapeutic PTT. anticoagulation may be
   clearing slowly given probable liver dz
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT inceased to 30.6.  Likely
   hemoconcentration from fluid shifts from CVVH.  Has had guiaic positive
   stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Goal to transfuse > 21
   - No evidence of hemolysis labs
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.  ANCA negative, Low C3.    10cc
   overnight reflecting poor prognosis
   - f/u Cryos
   - Strict Is and Os
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting per ID
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim, G6PD neg).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with
   colitis.  .  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia, [**Month/Year (2) **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  U/s did not show any block in
   flow.  ?Tumor.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - completed 2 days stress dose steroids, begin taper
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can
   obtain CT head
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Obtain BM Bx results from [**Hospital1 587**], called yesterday, still pending.
   #)FEN -  TF.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - PPI; can restart on subq heparin.
   #) ACCESS
 L IJ , HD line, peripherals
   #) CONTACT - patient, son
   # )CODE - FULL
    #) DISPO - Pending clinical improvement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   # Acute respiratory decompensation
 Respiratory status has remained
   stable after lung collapse and bronchoscopy yesterday.  Interfering
   with respiratory failure are volume overload and mental status.
   Pneumonia less likely as CXR  not supportive of this, however will keep
   ddx broad given dx of HIV.
   - no plan for weaning today
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, he has recently been maintaining BP on minimal
   pressors.  Now worsening.  In terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **]
   negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other
   possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,  possible pneumonia.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   - On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   5.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   - hold CVVH
   # Thrombocytopenia - Pt had episode of acute thrombocytosis with nadir
   of 11, improved with transfusion.  Differential dx  includes:  DIC
   which is very likely.  Drug reaction, HAART Tx, Hep C induced, ITP.
   DIC is possible in setting of underlying sepsis, especially since
   concomittant HCT drop, elevated D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and
   rising INR, elevated fibrinogen.   Have not seen schistocytes on
   smear.  HIT unlikely given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   - c/s Heme onc - eval of peripheral smear, smear result not documented
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   - Heparin on hold given therapeutic PTT. anticoagulation may be
   clearing slowly given probable liver dz
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT inceased to 30.6.  Likely
   hemoconcentration from fluid shifts from CVVH.  Has had guiaic positive
   stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Goal to transfuse > 21
   - No evidence of hemolysis labs
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.  ANCA negative, Low C3.    10cc
   overnight reflecting poor prognosis
   - f/u Cryos
   - Strict Is and Os
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting per ID
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim, G6PD neg).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with
   colitis.  .  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia, [**Month/Year (2) **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  U/s did not show any block in
   flow.  ?Tumor.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - completed 2 days stress dose steroids, begin taper
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can
   obtain CT head
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Obtain BM Bx results from [**Hospital1 587**], called yesterday, still pending.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency, who was transferred to the MICU for hypotension. The patient's current conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory decompensation, with a stable respiratory status after lung collapse and bronchoscopy. The diagnosis of pneumonia is less likely, but the patient has a broad differential diagnosis.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, given the lack of response to volume and the elevated WBC count with bandemia. The patient is on levophed to maintain a MAP > 65.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a platelet count of 49, which is likely due to DIC. The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, including heparin, to prevent further thrombosis.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a superficial femoral vein clot, which is unclear whether it is provoked or unprovoked.
5. Dropping hematocrit: The patient's HCT has increased to 30.6, likely due to hemoconcentration from fluid shifts from CVVH.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient is anuric, with a possible etiology of ATN or hep-C related vasculitis.
7. HIV: The patient has a new diagnosis of HIV, which is unusual in an 80+ year old man. The patient is on HAART therapy and prophylaxis.
8. C. difficile colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile being treated with vancomycin and metronidazole. The patient's abdominal CT shows evidence of sigmoiditis consistent with colitis.
9. Hepatic infarct: The patient's abdominal CT reveals a wedge-shaped area on the liver that could be secondary to infarct.
10. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's history of adrenal insufficiency is unclear, but the patient is on stress dose steroids and is being tapered.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis can progress, leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. DIC: The patient's DIC can worsen, leading to further thrombocytopenia and bleeding.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can progress, leading to chronic kidney disease.
5. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV can progress, leading to opportunistic infections and cancer.
6. C. difficile colitis: The patient's C. difficile colitis can worsen, leading to complications such as toxic megacolon.
7. Hepatic infarct: The patient's hepatic infarct can worsen, leading to liver failure.
8. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's adrenal insufficiency can worsen, leading to adrenal crisis.

To prevent or manage these complications, the patient should receive close monitoring and treatment, including:

1. Respiratory support: The patient should receive respiratory support, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed.
2. Sepsis management: The patient should receive sepsis management, including antibiotics and source control.
3. DIC management: The patient should receive DIC management, including anticoagulation therapy and platelet transfusions as needed.
4. Renal support: The patient should receive renal support, including dialysis and fluid management.
5. HIV management: The patient should receive HIV management, including antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis.
6. C. difficile colitis management: The patient should receive C. difficile colitis management, including antibiotics and supportive care.
7. Hepatic infarct management: The patient should receive hepatic infarct management, including supportive care and potential liver transplantation.
8. Adrenal insufficiency management: The patient should receive adrenal insufficiency management, including stress dose steroids and supportive care."

   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, he has recently been maintaining BP on minimal
   pressors.  Now worsening.  In terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **]
   negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other
   possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,  possible pneumonia.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   - On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   5.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   # Thrombocytopenia - Pt had episode of acute thrombocytosis with nadir
   of 11, improved with transfusion.  Differential dx  includes:  DIC
   which is very likely.  Drug reaction, HAART Tx, Hep C induced, ITP.
   DIC is possible in setting of underlying sepsis, especially since
   concomittant HCT drop, elevated D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and
   rising INR, elevated fibrinogen.   Have not seen schistocytes on
   smear.  HIT unlikely given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   - c/s Heme onc - eval of peripheral smear, smear result not documented
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   - Heparin on hold given therapeutic PTT. anticoagulation may be
   clearing slowly given probable liver dz

   stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Tranfusion goal is 21
   - No evidence of hemolysis labs
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.  ANCA negative, Low C3.    10cc

   - f/u Cryos
   - Strict Is and Os
   - Continue CVVH
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting per ID
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim, G6PD neg).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with
   colitis.  .  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia, [**Month/Year (2) **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  U/s did not show any block in
   flow.  ?Tumor.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - completed 2 days stress dose steroids, begin taper
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can

   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency. He was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory decompensation, hypotension, and sepsis. He has a history of C. difficile colitis and is currently receiving treatment for it. He also has a diagnosis of DVT and is at risk for further complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely caused by a combination of factors, including his underlying medical conditions, the presence of C. difficile, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely caused by a combination of factors, including his underlying lung disease, the presence of C. difficile, and the use of sedation.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is likely caused by a combination of factors, including his underlying medical conditions, the use of diuretics, and the presence of C. difficile.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely caused by a combination of factors, including his underlying medical conditions, the use of antibiotics, and the presence of C. difficile.
5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's adrenal insufficiency is likely caused by a combination of factors, including his underlying medical conditions and the use of steroids.
6. Hepatic Infarct: The patient's hepatic infarct is likely caused by a combination of factors, including his underlying medical conditions and the use of antibiotics.
7. MDS: The patient's MDS is likely caused by a combination of factors, including his underlying medical conditions and the use of chemotherapy.

Risk Factors:

1. Age: The patient is 81 years old, which increases his risk of developing complications.
2. Underlying Medical Conditions: The patient has a number of underlying medical conditions, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency, which increase his risk of developing complications.
3. Use of Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics: The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, which increase his risk of developing C. difficile and other complications.
4. Use of Sedation: The patient is receiving sedation, which increases his risk of developing respiratory failure and other complications.
5. Use of Diuretics: The patient is receiving diuretics, which increase his risk of developing renal failure and other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Continue to provide supportive care, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed.
3. Continue to treat the patient's underlying medical conditions, including his HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency.
4. Consider transferring the patient to a specialty unit, such as a burn unit or a transplant unit, if necessary.
5. Consider consulting with a specialist, such as a pulmonologist or a nephrologist, if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old man with a complex medical condition. He has been diagnosed with HIV, C. diff, lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypotension, and acute renal failure. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's condition has worsened overnight, with a 2L negative fluid balance and stopped urine output. His vital signs are stable, but he has a high risk of developing complications such as sepsis, acute kidney injury, and respiratory failure.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 4.5, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, platelet count of 67, and creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are abnormal, with a potassium level of 3.6 mEq/L and a phosphorus level of 2.6 mg/dL.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. He is also receiving stress dose steroids and pressors to manage his hypotension.

The patient's plan of care includes treating his C. diff infection with vancomycin and metronidazole, managing his DVT with heparin, and optimizing his renal function with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). He will also require ongoing monitoring of his electrolyte levels and management of his respiratory and cardiovascular status.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and C. diff infection increase his risk of developing sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal failure and electrolyte imbalances increase his risk of developing acute kidney injury.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure and hypoxemia increase his risk of developing further respiratory complications.
4. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's DVT increases his risk of developing pulmonary embolism.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count and platelet count increase his risk of developing bleeding complications.
6. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV infection increases his risk of developing opportunistic infections and malignancies.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and high risk of complications, it is essential to closely monitor his condition and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Met with the son and daughter of Mr. [**Known lastname **] this evening.  We discussed
   the lack of recovery of renal function and the multi system organ
   failure despite aggressive measures.  I told them that I felt his
   prognosis was very poor.  Given this, they have decided to switch his
   goals of care to comfort measures, and are planning to withdraw
   mechanical ventilation and pressors in the morning.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   ------ Protected Section ------
   Met with the son and daughter of Mr. [**Known lastname **] this evening.  We discussed
   the lack of recovery of renal function and the multi system organ
   failure despite aggressive measures.  I told them that I felt his
   prognosis was very poor.  Given this, they have decided to switch his
   goals of care to comfort measures, and are planning to withdraw
   mechanical ventilation and pressors in the morning.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 1776**] [**Name8 (MD) **], MD

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill 81-year-old man with a diagnosis of HIV, C. diff, LLE DVT, hypotension, and worsening renal failure and acidosis. The patient's condition is unstable, with anuria, hypoxemia, and septic shock.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and cardiovascular instability.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with potential for pulmonary embolism (PE) or recurrent DVT.
3. Respiratory failure, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
4. Hypoxic encephalopathy due to prolonged hypoxemia.
5. Hemodynamic instability, including shock, requiring pressor support.
6. Renal failure, potentially leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or acute kidney injury (AKI).
7. HIV-related opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis.
8. C. diff-related colitis, potentially leading to toxic megacolon or perforation.
9. Pancytopenia, increasing the risk of bleeding or infection.
10. Multi-system organ failure, potentially leading to a poor prognosis.

Given the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to address these potential complications and provide optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a complex medical history, including HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency, who was transferred to the MICU for hypotension. He has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.1°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 80/54 mmHg. He has a white blood cell count of 2.2 K/uL and a platelet count of 59 K/uL. His lab results show hyperglycemia, with a glucose level of 280 mg/dL, and abnormal liver enzymes.

The patient's medical team has made several recommendations, including holding heparin, ordering mycotic isolation blood cultures, and performing various tests for fungal and viral infections. They have also recommended discontinuing antibiotics and adjusting his medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of C. diff infection and his current hyperglycemia, there is a risk of developing sepsis.
2. Mucormycosis: The patient's fungal isolates, including mycotic isolation blood cultures, may indicate a risk of developing mucormycosis.
3. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV infection may lead to various complications, including opportunistic infections and malignancies.
4. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's adrenal insufficiency may lead to hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and other complications.
5. MDS-related complications: The patient's MDS may lead to bleeding, infections, and other complications.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of C. diff infection and his current hyperglycemia may increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as diarrhea and abdominal pain.
7. Respiratory complications: The patient's mechanical ventilation and respiratory support may lead to respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and respiratory failure.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypotension and history of MDS may increase his risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest and myocardial infarction.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's history of MDS and his current intubation may increase his risk of developing neurological complications, such as seizures and stroke."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   # Acute respiratory decompensation
 Respiratory status has remained
   stable after lung collapse and bronchoscopy yesterday.  Interfering
   with respiratory failure are volume overload and mental status.
   Pneumonia less likely as CXR  not supportive of this, however will keep
   ddx broad given dx of HIV.
   - no plan for weaning today
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, he has recently been maintaining BP on minimal
   pressors.  Now worsening.  In terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **]
   negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other
   possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,  possible pneumonia.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   - On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   5.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   - hold CVVH
   # Thrombocytopenia - Pt had episode of acute thrombocytosis with nadir
   of 11, improved with transfusion.  Differential dx  includes:  DIC
   which is very likely.  Drug reaction, HAART Tx, Hep C induced, ITP.
   DIC is possible in setting of underlying sepsis, especially since
   concomittant HCT drop, elevated D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and
   rising INR, elevated fibrinogen.   Have not seen schistocytes on
   smear.  HIT unlikely given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   - c/s Heme onc - eval of peripheral smear, smear result not documented
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   - Heparin on hold given therapeutic PTT. anticoagulation may be
   clearing slowly given probable liver dz
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT inceased to 30.6.  Likely
   hemoconcentration from fluid shifts from CVVH.  Has had guiaic positive
   stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Goal to transfuse > 21
   - No evidence of hemolysis labs
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.  ANCA negative, Low C3.    10cc
   overnight reflecting poor prognosis
   - f/u Cryos
   - Strict Is and Os
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting per ID
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim, G6PD neg).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with
   colitis.  .  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia, [**Month/Year (2) **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  U/s did not show any block in
   flow.  ?Tumor.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - completed 2 days stress dose steroids, begin taper
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can
   obtain CT head
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Obtain BM Bx results from [**Hospital1 587**], called yesterday, still pending.
   #)FEN -  TF.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - PPI; can restart on subq heparin.
   #) ACCESS
 L IJ , HD line, peripherals
   #) CONTACT - patient, son
   # )CODE - DNR
    #) DISPO - Pending clinical improvement.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is an 81 year old male who over the past 3-4 months has had new
   diagnoses of HIV, MDS, and adrenal insufficiency presenting with [**Last Name (un) **]
   and C diff from an outside hospital and now transferred to the MICU for
   hypotension.
   # Acute respiratory decompensation
 Respiratory status has remained
   stable after lung collapse and bronchoscopy yesterday.  Interfering
   with respiratory failure are volume overload and mental status.
   Pneumonia less likely as CXR  not supportive of this, however will keep
   ddx broad given dx of HIV.
   - no plan for weaning today
   # Hypotension:  Sepsis versus hypovolemia vs adrenal insufficiency.
   Resolving with decreased pressor requirement and elevated BPs.  Most
   likely due to sepsis given lack of response to volume as well as
   markedly elevated WBC count w/ bandemia, hypothermia (95 - 96.5).
   Adrenal crisis, he has recently been maintaining BP on minimal
   pressors.  Now worsening.  In terms of sepsis, unclear source: [**Name (NI) **]
   negative [**Name (NI) **] but does have CT suggestive of sigmoiditis.  Other
   possibilities: cellulitis on LLE,  possible pneumonia.
   - On levophed to maintain MAP > 65
   - F/u blood and sputum cxs.
   - On broad spectrum abx (vanc + cefepime) given no known source, on day
   5.
   - continue IV flagyl and po vanco given strong concern for [**Name (NI) **]: ID
   recommends consulting GI re: proving this.
   - Avoiding fluids given that not making urine and likely volume
   overloaded
   - hold CVVH
   # Thrombocytopenia - Pt had episode of acute thrombocytosis with nadir
   of 11, improved with transfusion.  Differential dx  includes:  DIC
   which is very likely.  Drug reaction, HAART Tx, Hep C induced, ITP.
   DIC is possible in setting of underlying sepsis, especially since
   concomittant HCT drop, elevated D-dimer, rising PTT (was 150) and
   rising INR, elevated fibrinogen.   Have not seen schistocytes on
   smear.  HIT unlikely given low pretest probability and negative HIT Ab.
   - c/s Heme onc - eval of peripheral smear, smear result not documented
   -Check platelets and coags [**Hospital1 **]; replenish platelets if < 10.  If active
   bleeding noted, transfuse platelets and FFP.
   -Would restart on heparin given very low pre-test probability for HIT;
   is potentially beneficial in DIC and pt does require continued
   anticoagulation for DVT.
   #) DVT - superficial femoral vein clot per LENI.  Unclear if provoked
   or unprovoked.  DVT could explain erythema along thigh as well as
   edema.  Less likely explains hypothermia and leukocytosis as above.
   -D/c argatroban and restart on heparin
   - Heparin on hold given therapeutic PTT. anticoagulation may be
   clearing slowly given probable liver dz
   #) Dropping Hematocrit - HCT inceased to 30.6.  Likely
   hemoconcentration from fluid shifts from CVVH.  Has had guiaic positive
   stool in past but no overt evidence of bleeding.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   - Goal to transfuse > 21
   - No evidence of hemolysis labs
   #) Acute Renal Failure: Pt now anuric.  Possibly caused by acute
   hypotensive insult to kidneys with low reserve.  Renal following; they
   spun urine and saw dense and multiple granular casts.  Most likely
   etiology is ATN.  However, given hx of hepatitis C, large RBCs in
   urine, and dark, purplish patches on skin that we are calling
   cellulitis, should consider the possibility of hep - C related
   vasculitis or other etiologies for GN.  ANCA negative, Low C3.    10cc
   overnight reflecting poor prognosis
   - f/u Cryos
   - Strict Is and Os
   #) HIV
 Strange for new diagnosis of HIV in 80+ year old man and
   picture complicated by son as primary historian who is not aware of
   risk factors.  Was on HAART and prophylaxis per report until fairly
   recently.  Per report CD4 is 250 but repeat CD4 is 40.
   -hold on HAART therapy in acute setting per ID
   -Started prophylaxis for MAC w/ azithromycin given low CD4 (1200 qweek)
   and dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2000**] (allergy to bactrim, G6PD neg).
   #) C. Difficile Colitis : History of C diff being treated with vanc
   since [**10-11**] and vanc/IV metronidazole starting on [**10-21**].  With continued
   diarrhea on arrival here.  Would be concerned for other sources of
   diarrhea.   Abdominal CT shows evidence for sigmoiditis consistent with
   colitis.  .  O&P negative, no crypto, Giardia, [**Month/Year (2) **], coccidio
   - repeat [**Month/Year (2) **] tox X 3 have been negative, but ID continues to have
   high suspicion, especially secondary to CT findings: they recommend
   consulting GI.  Would hold off on this, as unlikely that pt can be
   scoped and biopsied in this setting.
   - continue Vanco Flagyl
   - f/u stool studies
   #) Hepatic infarct - Abdominal CT reveals wedge shaped area on liver
   that could be secondary to infarct.  U/s did not show any block in
   flow.  ?Tumor.
   -AST/ALT, alk phos, t-bili all within normal limits; INR mildly
   elevated 1.3 - 1.7; does not suggest any obvious hepatic insult.
   #) Adrenal Insufficiency
 Unclear history.  Per reports seems was
   recently stable on this dose of dexamethasone but unclear how compliant
   he has been with this.
   - completed 2 days stress dose steroids, begin taper
   # Acute mental status change
 Differential is hypoxia vs TTP vs
   ischemic/embolic event vs effects of sedation
   -Ideally would obtain MRI however not practical given dialysis machine
   -Continue to watch to see if improvement off sedation; if not in PM can
   obtain CT head
   #) MDS : Also diagnosed in [**2194-7-23**] without a great deal of
   documentation (as with other problems).  Need to obtain OSH.
   -support w/ transfusions PRN (Hct<22, Plt<10)
   -Obtain BM Bx results from [**Hospital1 587**], called yesterday, still pending.
   #)FEN -  TF.  Replenish electrolytes (calcium was low this AM).
   #)PPX - PPI; can restart on subq heparin.
   #) ACCESS
 L IJ , HD line, peripherals
   #) CONTACT - patient, son
   # )CODE - DNR
    #) DISPO - Pending clinical improvement.

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, and the note mentions that the patient is still at risk for sepsis due to the presence of a central line and the patient's recent antibiotic use.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding. The patient's platelet count should be monitored closely to prevent bleeding complications.
3. DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation): The patient has a high D-dimer level, which can indicate DIC. DIC can cause bleeding and organ failure.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is anuric, which can increase the risk of acute renal failure. The patient's creatinine level is high, and the patient is at risk for further kidney damage.
5. Hepatic Infarct: The patient has a wedge-shaped area on the liver, which could be a sign of a liver infarct. This can cause liver failure and death.
6. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency, and the note mentions that the patient may not be compliant with medication. This can cause adrenal crisis, which can be life-threatening.
7. C. Difficile Colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, and the note mentions that the patient is still experiencing diarrhea. This can cause electrolyte imbalances and dehydration.
8. MDS (Myelodysplastic Syndrome): The patient has a diagnosis of MDS, which can increase the risk of bleeding and infection.
9. Acute Mental Status Change: The patient has a history of acute mental status change, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including hypoxia, TTP, ischemic/embolic event, or effects of sedation.

The patient's condition is unstable, and the patient is at risk for further complications. The patient's treatment plan should be closely monitored, and the patient's condition should be reassessed regularly to prevent further complications."
