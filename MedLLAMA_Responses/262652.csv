   Assessment and Plan
   VBG added to f/u pH of 7.2, thought to be from opioid-induced
   hypoventilation
   Stress dose steroids are 2-3 times home dose.  D/C IV steroids today.
   15 mg Prednisone ordered
   24 y/o woman with SLE, stage 5 chronic kidney disease, and hypertension
   who presents in transfer from the medical floor with hypotension and
   altered mental status.
   # Hypotension: Improved after arrival to the MICU and after
   administration of naloxone. Could be related to narcosis, though
   concerning in this patient with difficult to control hypertension who
   missed several of her medications today that there is underlying
   infectious process with ? early sepsis. CXR without obvious infiltrate,
   though other potential sources would include peritoneal fluid (PD
   cath), urine, and blood (though patient does not have any indwelling
   lines). Hip, due to small effusion, could be another source though no
   pain with active or passive motion on my exam to suggest septic
   arthritis. Patient's clonidine patch actually intact throughout episode
   (including improvement of BPs to 150s systolic), so will keep on for
   now and continue to monitor.
   - send blood cultures, UA & cultures, PD dialysate culture
   - as BP improved to 150s systolic with only intervention naloxone, will
   continue to monitor, though will consider antibiotics if hypotension
   recurs
   - if hypotension recurs, remove clonidine patch
   - consider hip effusion as potential source if patient decompensates
   - due to chronic steroid use, if hypotension recurs or persists, would
   use stress dose steroids
   # Altered mental status: Prior to transfer, the patient was noted to be
   less arousable. Had received narcotics, though these were last given in
   the morning. By time of transfer back to mental baseline per patient
   and family, though patient does not recall episode (including ABG).
   - avoid sedating medications
   - continue to monitor though appears at current baseline
   # Right leg/hip pain: no evidence of avascular necrosis or fracture on
   MRI though there is a small effusion.
   - continue to monitor
   - avoid narcotics for now, restart slowly when mentally clear in the AM
   # Hyperkalemia: Chronic issue. Patient takes kayexalate intermittently
   per her report (last dose Monday).
   - will give single dose of kayexelate 30 g PO X 1 now
   - no further calcium gluconate as calcium level > 15 (though suspect
   drawn near calcium infusion)
   # CKD V: Chronic issue and not yet on PD as she has not tolerated it
   during this admission.
   - Renal following and aware of ICU transfer
   # Anemia: Hct stable around 20. S/p 1 U PRBCs today with Hct 20.1 to
   21.9. Continue to monitor.
   - guaiac stools
   #. Prior SVC thrombus: INR 3.5 on ICU admission. Hold warfarin tonight
   and recheck INR in AM.
   # Systemic lupus erythematosus: continue home prednisone dose of 5 mg
   PO daily
   # FEN: low sodium, renal diet; treatment of hyperkalemia as above,
   replete other lytes prn
   # Proph: INR therapeutic, no indication for PPI, kayexalate for bowels

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* No edema, DP pulses 2+ bilaterally, warm, and no pain with passive motion of the right hip joint

Laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 4.3-5.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 7.6-8.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 95-116 K/uL
* Creatinine: 8.8-2.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 16-23.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 99-119 mg/dL
* Calcium: 7.2-8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.5-2.5 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 5.8-8.5 mg/dL
* Albumin: 3.9 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.9 mmol/L

The patient's imaging studies include:

* Echo (PA hypertension)
* V/Q scan
* U/S

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypotension: Improved after arrival to the MICU and after administration of naloxone. Considered to be related to opioid-induced hypoventilation, though underlying infectious process with early sepsis is a concern. CXR without obvious infiltrate.
* Altered mental status: Prior to transfer, the patient was noted to be less arousable. Had received narcotics, though these were last given in the morning. By time of transfer back to mental baseline per patient and family, though patient does not recall episode (including ABG).
* Right leg/hip pain: No evidence of avascular necrosis or fracture on MRI though there is a small effusion.
* Hyperkalemia: Chronic issue. Patient takes kayexalate intermittently per her report (last dose Monday).
* CKD V: Chronic issue and not yet on PD as she has not tolerated it during this admission.
* Anemia: Hct stable around 20. S/p 1 U PRBCs today with Hct 20.1 to 21.9. Continue to monitor.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis: Given the patient's history of chronic kidney disease and hypertension, she may be at risk for developing sepsis, particularly with early sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's altered mental status and hypoventilation may increase her risk for respiratory failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and chronic kidney disease may increase her risk for cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
* Infection: The patient's chronic kidney disease and immunosuppressive therapy may increase her risk for infection, particularly with opportunistic pathogens.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and electrolyte imbalance may increase her risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
* Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and electrolyte imbalance may increase her risk for neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke."

   Imaging: V/Q scan, U/S
   TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is severe symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
   normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left
   ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 80%). A mild (18
   mmHg) mid-cavitary gradient is identified. Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   stenosis. The increased transaortic velocity is likely related to high
   cardiac output. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. There is no
   systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) mitral

   aortic regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. Findings
   consistent with hyperrtophic cardiomyopathy.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2140-8-26**], pulmonary
   hypertension has developed (also present on the study from [**2140-5-20**]).
   Pericardial effusion is also new.
   V/Q scan:
   Improved V/Q scan from [**9-/2139**] with no findings to suggest acute

   cephalic veins were performed. There is nonocclusive focal thrombus
   seen in
   the left subclavian vein, where the vein is not fully compressible.
   Flow is
   seen in the region, indicating that the thrombus is nonocclusive.
   Elsewhere,
   normal flow, augmentation, compressibility were appropriate and
   waveforms are
   demonstrated.
   Assessment and Plan
   24 y/o woman with SLE, stage 5 chronic kidney disease, and hypertension
   who presents in transfer from the medical floor with hypotension and
   altered mental status.
   # Labile blood pressure: Hypotension improved after arrival to the MICU
   and after administration of naloxone. Could be related to narcosis,
   though concerning in this patient with difficult to control
   hypertension who missed several of her medications today that there is
   underlying infectious process with ? early sepsis. CXR without obvious
   infiltrate, PD fluid without infection, no pyuria. Hip, due to small
   effusion, could be another source though no pain with active or passive
   motion on my exam to suggest septic arthritis. Patient's clonidine
   patch actually intact throughout episode (including improvement of BPs
   to 150s systolic), so will keep on for now and continue to monitor.
   Doing well on prednisone 15mg (home dose 5mg).
   - rheum saw patient and did not feel there is much concern for septic
   joint
   - f/u blood cultures
   - as BP improved to 150s systolic with only intervention naloxone, will
   continue to monitor, though will consider antibiotics if hypotension
   recurs
   - if hypotension recurs, remove clonidine patch
   - d/c hydralazine
   - consider hip effusion as potential source if patient decompensates
   # Febrile Episode: unclear etiology. On vancomycin, levofloxacin, and
   aztreonam
   - await culture results --- if no growth for 48-72 hours and still no
   clear source, d/c antibiotics
   # Altered mental status: Prior to transfer, the patient was noted to be
   less arousable. Had received narcotics, though these were last given in
   the morning. By time of transfer back to mental baseline per patient
   and family, though patient does not recall episode (including ABG).
   - avoid sedating medications
   - continue to monitor though appears at current baseline
   # Right leg/hip pain: Resolved per patient.  No evidence of avascular
   necrosis or fracture on MRI though there is a small effusion.
   - continue to monitor
   - avoid morphine, use Tylenol and vicodin for pain control
   # Hyperkalemia: Chronic issue. Patient takes kayexalate intermittently
   per her report (last dose Monday).
   - monitor and dose as needed
   # CKD V: Renal following. Did well with PD on [**9-22**]
   - f/u daily renal recs for PD
   # Anemia: Hct stable around 20. S/p 1 U PRBCs today with Hct 20.1 to
   21.9. Continue to monitor.
   - guaiac stools
   #. Prior SVC thrombus: INR 3.5 on ICU admission. Hold warfarin tonight
   and recheck INR in AM.
   # Systemic lupus erythematosus: Home prednisone dose 5mg. Currently on
   15mg in setting of acute illness (day 2)
   # FEN: low sodium, renal diet; treatment of hyperkalemia as above,
   replete other lytes prn
   # Proph: INR therapeutic, no indication for PPI, kayexalate for bowels

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - await culture results --- if no growth for 48-72 hours and still no
   clear source, d/c antibiotics
   # Altered mental status: Prior to transfer, the patient was noted to be
   less arousable. Had received narcotics, though these were last given in
   the morning. By time of transfer back to mental baseline per patient
   and family, though patient does not recall episode (including ABG).
   - avoid sedating medications
   - continue to monitor though appears at current baseline
   # Right leg/hip pain: Resolved per patient.  No evidence of avascular
   necrosis or fracture on MRI though there is a small effusion.
   - continue to monitor
   - avoid morphine, use Tylenol and vicodin for pain control
   # Hyperkalemia: Chronic issue. Patient takes kayexalate intermittently
   per her report (last dose Monday).
   - monitor and dose as needed
   # CKD V: Renal following. Did well with PD on [**9-22**]
   - f/u daily renal recs for PD
   # Anemia: Hct stable around 20. S/p 1 U PRBCs today with Hct 20.1 to
   21.9. Continue to monitor.
   - guaiac stools
   #. Prior SVC thrombus: INR 3.5 on ICU admission. Hold warfarin tonight
   and recheck INR in AM.
   # Systemic lupus erythematosus: Home prednisone dose 5mg. Currently on
   15mg in setting of acute illness (day 2)
   # FEN: low sodium, renal diet; treatment of hyperkalemia as above,
   replete other lytes prn
   # Proph: INR therapeutic, no indication for PPI, kayexalate for bowels

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old woman with stage 5 chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and systemic lupus erythematosus who was transferred to the ICU from the medical floor due to hypotension and altered mental status. She has been receiving antibiotics for an unclear etiology of her febrile episode. Her blood pressure has improved after administration of naloxone, but concerns remain about potential underlying infectious processes. She has also developed a small effusion in her right hip, which may be a potential source of infection. Her medical history is significant for chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's febrile episode and hypotension may be indicative of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Infection: The patient's small effusion in her right hip may be a potential source of infection, which could lead to septic arthritis or sepsis if not treated promptly.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and hyperdynamic systolic function may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
4. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's moderate pulmonary hypertension may increase her risk of pulmonary complications, such as pulmonary edema or respiratory failure.
5. Renal Complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease may increase her risk of renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or worsening of her chronic kidney disease.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and use of medications such as kayexalate may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation or gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and vital signs closely to ensure that her hypotension does not recur.
2. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's treatment regimen if her febrile episode is not responding to current therapy.
3. Monitor the patient's right hip effusion closely for signs of infection or septic arthritis.
4. Consider performing additional imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to evaluate the patient's cardiac and pulmonary status.
5. Continue to manage the patient's chronic kidney disease and hypertension with medications and dietary interventions.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely and consider adding medications to prevent constipation or gastrointestinal bleeding."
