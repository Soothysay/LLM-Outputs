 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Pt was admitted to ICU rather than floor post-op due to hypotension.
   Hypotension was thought to be related to A. fib with RVR with rates
   ranging from 110-120s. Pt received a total of 7L NS in the PACU over 7
   hours but was still noted to have a BP in the mid 70s, asymptomatic.
   Differential includes A. fib with RVR given his prior history, however
   would expect a more impressive rate to give such hypotension. Other
   differentials to consider include possible sepsis that could have
   occured peri-op, he was also noted to have leukocytosis prior to his
   operation. On review of his record he has had septic shock after GU
   procedures as well as a history of VRE, pan sensitive E.Coli. Pt's BP
   also noted to decrease after Diltiazem 120mg was given.   Pt mentating
   well currently. Changed abx of Vanc and Ceftriaxone to Zosyn (for broad
   Gram positive, negative coverage) and Linezolid (VRE coverage). Pt
   received Diltiazem and is on Morphine PCA which could also explain the
   hypotension. Hypotension could also be reaction to anaesthesia
   medications during surgery, would expect hypotension to improve once
   medications start to clear.

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Pt has history of A. fib with RVR post-op following a prior GU surgery
   performed in [**2127**]. On review of anaesthesia records it appears his A.
   fib was in the 100-120 range, he received a total of 9L NS as mentioned
   above as well as 2u PRBC. He received Diltiazem 120mg SR at [**2033**] with
   his rate responding 85-103. Pt currently NPO post-op and unable to
   receive meds. On review it appears pt required Amiodarone 150mg bolus
   and drip.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old male admitted to the ICU post-operatively due to hypotension. He has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and has undergone an ileal conduit urinary diversion. He was given a total of 7L of normal saline in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) but still had a blood pressure in the mid-70s. His blood pressure decreased after receiving Diltiazem 120mg, and he was started on morphine PCA. The patient's differential diagnosis includes atrial fibrillation with RVR, sepsis, and reaction to anesthesia medications. He was also given antibiotics for broad Gram-positive and negative coverage and VRE coverage.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, and his blood culture is pending. His creatinine level is elevated, and he has a history of chronic kidney disease. He is also experiencing hyperchloremic acidosis, likely related to large-volume resuscitation with normal saline.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of VRE colonization and pan-sensitive E. coli, sepsis is a potential complication that needs to be monitored and managed promptly.
2. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR needs to be managed to prevent further complications such as stroke or cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis needs to be monitored and managed to prevent further complications such as sepsis or infection.
4. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and current creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL need to be monitored and managed to prevent further complications such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease progression.
5. Hyperchloremic acidosis: The patient's hyperchloremic acidosis needs to be managed to prevent further complications such as electrolyte imbalances or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. VRE colonization: The patient's VRE colonization needs to be monitored and managed to prevent further complications such as sepsis or infection.

ICU care plan:

1. Continue antibiotics for broad Gram-positive and negative coverage and VRE coverage.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust medication as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR and adjust medication as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's leukocytosis and adjust antibiotic coverage as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medication as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust medication as needed.
7. Continue to trend the patient's creatinine level and urine output.
8. Follow up with the patient's urologist and nephrologist as needed.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust medication as needed.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's nutrition and adjust as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Pt was admitted to ICU rather than floor post-op due to hypotension.
   Hypotension was thought to be related to A. fib with RVR with rates
   ranging from 110-120s. Pt received a total of 7L NS in the PACU over 7
   hours but was still noted to have a BP in the mid 70s, asymptomatic.
   Differential includes A. fib with RVR given his prior history, however
   would expect a more impressive rate to give such hypotension. Other
   differentials to consider include possible sepsis that could have
   occured peri-op, he was also noted to have leukocytosis prior to his
   operation. On review of his record he has had septic shock after GU
   procedures as well as a history of VRE, pan sensitive E.Coli. Pt's BP
   also noted to decrease after Diltiazem 120mg was given.   Pt mentating
   well currently. Changed abx of Vanc and Ceftriaxone to Ceftriaxone
   (given pansensitive in past for everything but VRE) and Linezolid (VRE
   coverage). Pt received Diltiazem and is on Morphine PCA which could
   also explain the hypotension. Hypotension could also be reaction to
   anaesthesia medications during surgery, would expect hypotension to
   improve once medications start to clear.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old post-operative male with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency, and a recent ileal conduit urinary diversion. He was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension, which was initially thought to be related to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. However, the patient's blood pressure did not improve despite receiving 7L of normal saline in the post-anesthesia care unit.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 116 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 81/54 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 94% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is notable for an irregularly irregular heartbeat, good air movement bilaterally, and no evidence of edema. His abdomen is tender to palpation, and he has a right lower quadrant ostomy with a drain in place.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 192 K/uL. His creatinine level is 1.7 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen is 29 mg/dL.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypotension, atrial fibrillation, leukocytosis, and chronic renal insufficiency. He is also at risk for hyperchloremic acidosis due to the large volume of normal saline resuscitation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and history of VRE colonization increase his risk of developing sepsis.
2. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency and history of ATN from hypovolemia put him at risk for further renal damage.
3. Hyperchloremic acidosis: The patient's large volume of normal saline resuscitation increases his risk of developing hyperchloremic acidosis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's atrial fibrillation and respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute increase his risk of developing respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of VRE colonization increase his risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

1. Antibiotics: The patient is receiving Ceftriaxone and Linezolid to cover potential infections.
2. Cardioversion: The patient is receiving Amiodarone to control his atrial fibrillation.
3. Pain management: The patient is receiving Morphine PCA for pain control.
4. Fluid management: The patient is receiving normal saline and LR to manage his fluid status.
5. Renal support: The patient is receiving renal support with dopamine and furosemide to manage his renal insufficiency.

The patient's current disposition is the floor once his Amiodarone load is completed and his rate control is good."

   Heart rate improved (still afib) with initiation of amiodarone and
   diltiazem. BP low-normal, which is the patient's baseline pressure.
   Good urine output since arrival in ICU. Contiues on antibiotics for
   possible VRE sepsis, which he has had before. Transient bacteremia may
   be more likely cause of low BP, which is now back to baseline. Has not
   required any vasopressors. Complete amiodarone load.
   Metabolic, non-gap acidosis probably due to large volumes of normal
   saline fluid resuscitation. If additional fluids required, would use
   lactated Ringers.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition. Here is a summary of the patient's current status:

* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation (AFib) and hypotension, with a blood pressure of 96/53 mmHg. The patient's heart rate has improved with the initiation of amiodarone and diltiazem, but remains in AFib.
* Respiratory: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 98%. The patient's respiratory status appears to be stable.
* Renal: The patient has chronic renal failure, and their creatinine level is within normal range. The patient is producing good urine output.
* Metabolic: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which is likely due to the large volume of normal saline fluid resuscitation.
* Infectious: The patient is receiving antibiotics for possible VRE sepsis, which they have had before. They have a history of transient bacteremia, which may be contributing to their hypotension.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low-normal, and their heart rate is still in AFib. If their blood pressure continues to drop, they may require vasopressors to maintain adequate perfusion.
* Progressive renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen if they continue to receive large volumes of fluids.
* Increased risk of infection: The patient's history of VRE sepsis and transient bacteremia may increase their risk of developing further infections.
* Metabolic decompensation: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if they continue to receive large volumes of normal saline fluids.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's AFib may worsen if their heart rate continues to be irregular, and they may be at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias or even cardiac arrest.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   .
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Pt has history of A. fib with RVR post-op following a prior GU surgery
   performed in [**2127**]. On review of anaesthesia records it appears his A.
   fib was in the 100-120 range, he received a total of 9L NS as mentioned
   above as well as 2u PRBC. He received Diltiazem 120mg SR at [**2033**] with
   his rate responding 85-103. Pt currently NPO post-op and unable to
   receive meds. On review it appears pt required Amiodarone 150mg bolus
   and drip. Pt with rate in 120s on amio gtt, stable BPs. 1 dose of IV
   dilt did not improve rate significantly and it dropped BP. Volume
   overload may be contributing to difficulty with rate control. EKG this
   AM continues to show AF with RVR.
   - amiodarone gtt complete, did not start PO dosing still unclear if
   outpatient longterm amiodarone is best choice
   - trial IV dilt boluses, consider PO dosing if effective vs. dilt gtt
   if having BP issues
   - consider cardiology consult if refractory after dilt
   - restart warfarin
   - TBB goal -500 to 1L today (patient autodiuresing, can add Lasix prn)
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Pt received a total of 7L NS in the PACU over 7 hours but was still
   noted to have a BP in the mid 70s, asymptomatic. Thought to be [**2-17**] AF
   with RVR. On review of his record he has had septic shock after GU
   procedures as well as a history of VRE, pan sensitive E.Coli. Pt's BP
   also noted to decrease after Diltiazem 120mg was given. Changed abx of
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone to Ceftriaxone (given pansensitive in past for
   everything but VRE) and Linezolid (VRE coverage). Pt has baseline low
   BP in 100s. Does not appear to be infected.
   - f/u urine, bld culture
   - D/C abx
   - trend leukocytosis and fever curve
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   s/p Ileal Conduit urinary diversion: Pt underwent  ileal conduit
   urinary diversion with removal of neobladder. Urology currently
   following pt, who is NPO per their recommendations.
   - f/u Urology recs
   - will keep NPO for now
   - Morphine PCA for pain control
   - IS, OOB TID
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
   Renal Insufficiency: Pt currently sees a Nephrologist in [**Location (un) 755**] for
   his insufficiency. Prior to admission baseline Creatinine has ranged
   from 1.9-2.0. Prior Creatinine level of [**4-19**] was thought to be due to
   ATN from hypovolemia. Renal insufficiency is thought to be [**2-17**]
   obstruction from transitional bladder cell cancer with obstruction.
   - trend Creatinine, improving today
   - follow urine output
   .
   ##. Hyperchloremic Acidosis: Likely related to large volume
   resuscitation from NS.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   fib was in the 100-120 range, he received a total of 9L NS as mentioned
   above as well as 2u PRBC. He received Diltiazem 120mg SR at [**2033**] with
   his rate responding 85-103. Pt currently NPO post-op and unable to
   receive meds. On review it appears pt required Amiodarone 150mg bolus
   and drip. Pt with rate in 120s on amio gtt, stable BPs. 1 dose of IV
   dilt did not improve rate significantly and it dropped BP. Volume
   overload may be contributing to difficulty with rate control. EKG this
   AM continues to show AF with RVR.
   - amiodarone gtt complete, did not start PO dosing still unclear if
   outpatient longterm amiodarone is best choice
   - trial IV dilt boluses, consider PO dosing if effective vs. dilt gtt
   if having BP issues
   - consider cardiology consult if refractory after dilt
   - restart warfarin
   - TBB goal -500 to 1L today (patient autodiuresing, can add Lasix prn)
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Pt received a total of 7L NS in the PACU over 7 hours but was still
   noted to have a BP in the mid 70s, asymptomatic. Thought to be [**2-17**] AF
   with RVR. On review of his record he has had septic shock after GU
   procedures as well as a history of VRE, pan sensitive E.Coli. Pt's BP
   also noted to decrease after Diltiazem 120mg was given. Changed abx of
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone to Ceftriaxone (given pansensitive in past for
   everything but VRE) and Linezolid (VRE coverage). Pt has baseline low
   BP in 100s. Does not appear to be infected.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is a Caucasian male with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and chronic renal failure (CRF).
* He underwent ileal conduit urinary diversion surgery and is currently NPO per urology recommendations.
* He has a history of septic shock and VRE infection.
* He is currently receiving amiodarone for rate control and has a borderline tachycardia.
* His blood pressure is stable, but his creatinine level is elevated.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Complications:**
	* Atrial fibrillation (AF) may lead to embolic events, such as stroke or systemic embolism.
	* Tachycardia may exacerbate cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
2. **Renal Complications:**
	* Chronic renal failure (CRF) may worsen if not managed properly, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and anemia.
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) may occur due to volume overload, sepsis, or medications.
3. **Infection Complications:**
	* Sepsis may occur due to bacterial infections, such as VRE or pan-sensitive E. coli.
	* Infections may worsen if not properly treated, leading to septic shock or organ failure.
4. **Gastrointestinal Complications:**
	* Hyperchloremic acidosis may occur due to large volume resuscitation with normal saline.
	* Stress ulceration may occur due to the patient's medical condition and medications.
5. **Thrombotic Complications:**
	* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) may occur due to immobility and underlying medical conditions.
	* Pulmonary embolism (PE) may occur if DVT is not properly treated.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust medications as necessary.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management and medications accordingly.
3. Continue to treat infections promptly and effectively to prevent sepsis and organ failure.
4. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal function and adjust medications as necessary to prevent stress ulceration.
5. Monitor the patient for thrombotic complications and adjust prophylaxis as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 7L positive post-operative male with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, and VRE colonization in his GU system. He underwent an ileal conduit urinary diversion and is currently NPO. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 124 bpm and blood pressure of 116/71 mmHg. He has a temperature of 36.8°C and oxygen saturation of 95%. His respiratory support is minimal, with no oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation.

The patient received a total of 7L of normal saline in the PACU over 7 hours, but his blood pressure remained in the mid 70s, asymptomatic. He was given IV diltiazem 10mg, which did not improve his blood pressure significantly and dropped it slightly. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL.

The patient has a history of septic shock after GU procedures and has received antibiotics for pan-sensitive E. coli and VRE. He is currently receiving ceftriaxone and linezolid, and his urine and blood cultures are pending. His leukocytosis is being trended, and his fever curve is being monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and he may require further treatment to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being treated with amiodarone, and his rate is being monitored.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen if he does not receive adequate fluid management and electrolyte replacement.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of infection, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause.
5. Hyperchloremic Acidosis: The patient's large volume resuscitation with normal saline may have caused hyperchloremic acidosis, which has been resolved.
6. VRE Colonization: The patient's VRE colonization in his GU system may lead to further infections if not properly managed.
7. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition. Here is a summary of the patient's current status:

* The patient is in atrial fibrillation (AFib) with a heart rate of 115-125 beats per minute (bpm) despite being loaded with amiodarone.
* The patient has persistent tachycardia, which may indicate a high risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
* The patient's blood pressure is stable, but there was a brief episode of hypotension yesterday.
* The patient's creatinine level is slightly decreased, suggesting potential improvement in renal function.
* The patient has chronic renal failure (CRF) and is at risk of worsening kidney function.
* The patient has a history of cancer, which may be contributing to their overall condition.
* The patient has leukocytosis, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation.
* The patient is afebrile, which is a positive sign.
* The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 95%.
* The patient's abdominal examination reveals soft and non-tender abdomen, but with diminished abdominal sounds near the surgical site.
* The patient's extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
* The patient's skin is warm and without rash or jaundice.
* The patient's neurologic examination reveals purposeful movement, but tone assessment is not available.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest, due to persistent tachycardia and AFib.
* Worsening kidney function, leading to acute kidney injury (AKI) or further decline in renal function.
* Infection or sepsis, which can exacerbate the patient's underlying medical conditions.
* Respiratory failure, which can occur if the patient's respiratory status worsens.
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation, due to the patient's abdominal examination findings.
* Neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures, due to the patient's underlying medical conditions.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to continue monitoring their vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal care."

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Pt has history of A. fib with RVR post-op following a prior GU surgery
   performed in [**2127**]. On review of anaesthesia records it appears his A.
   fib was in the 100-120 range, he received a total of 9L NS as mentioned
   above as well as 2u PRBC. He received Diltiazem 120mg SR at [**2033**] with
   his rate responding 85-103. Initially NPO post-op and unable to receive
   meds. On review it appears pt required Amiodarone 150mg bolus and drip.
   Pt with rate in 120s on amio gtt, stable BPs.  Volume overload may be
   contributing to difficulty with rate control, with increased
   sympathetic tone post-op contributing.   Started dilt gtt yesterday
   with good response, optimal control.

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Pt received a total of 7L NS in the PACU over 7 hours but was still
   noted to have a BP in the mid 70s, asymptomatic. Thought to be [**2-17**] AF
   with RVR. On review of his record he has had septic shock after GU
   procedures as well as a history of VRE, pan sensitive E.Coli. Pt's BP
   also noted to decrease after Diltiazem 120mg was given. Changed abx of
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone to Ceftriaxone (given pansensitive in past for
   everything but VRE) and Linezolid (VRE coverage). Pt has baseline low

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and chronic renal failure (CRF). He underwent an ileal conduit urinary diversion and is currently NPO per Urology recommendations. The patient was started on diltiazem for rate control, and his heart rate was controlled with IV boluses. He has been autodiurezing and has a positive fluid balance. The patient has a history of septic shock and VRE, and his antibiotics were discontinued due to negative cultures. He is currently receiving warfarin and linezolid for VRE coverage.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of AF and is currently on diltiazem for rate control. The risk of AF recurrence is high, and the patient may require further treatment to maintain rate control.
2. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a history of CRF, which may worsen if not managed properly. The patient's creatinine levels should be monitored regularly to prevent further decline.
3. Hyperchloremic Acidosis: The patient has a high risk of developing hyperchloremic acidosis due to his large volume resuscitation with NS. This should be monitored and treated promptly if necessary.
4. VRE: The patient has a history of VRE and is currently receiving linezolid for coverage. The risk of VRE recurrence is high, and the patient may require further treatment to prevent recurrence.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored due to his history of septic shock and VRE. The patient may require further treatment to prevent respiratory complications.
6. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient is NPO per Urology recommendations, which may lead to nutritional deficiencies. The patient's nutritional status should be closely monitored to prevent deficiencies.
7. Fluid Overload: The patient has a positive fluid balance, which may lead to fluid overload. The patient's fluid status should be closely monitored to prevent fluid overload."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a complex case with multiple comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, and a history of malignant neoplasm. The patient was recently treated with antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Linezolid, and Ceftriaxone. The patient's condition has been stable, with a controlled heart rate and blood pressure. However, the patient has not been passing flatus and has reported nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 79 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 118/69 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 92%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and the patient is receiving diltiazem to control the heart rate.

The patient's laboratory results show mild leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 11.6-13.6 x 10^9/L. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.5-1.7 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if the underlying cause is not addressed. The patient's heart rate and rhythm should be closely monitored to prevent complications.
2. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen if the underlying cause is not addressed. The patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored to prevent complications.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's mild leukocytosis may be a sign of an underlying infection. The patient's white blood cell count should be closely monitored to prevent complications.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's lack of bowel movement and reported nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may be a sign of gastrointestinal complications. The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms should be closely monitored to prevent complications.
5. Diltiazem toxicity: The patient is receiving diltiazem to control the heart rate. The patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored to prevent diltiazem toxicity.
6. Blood product transfusion reactions: The patient has received multiple blood product transfusions. The patient's blood products should be carefully screened to prevent transfusion reactions.
7. Infection: The patient's lack of bowel movement and reported nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may be a sign of an underlying infection. The patient's infection should be closely monitored to prevent complications."

   Pt has history of A. fib with RVR post-op following a prior GU surgery
   performed in [**2127**]. On review of anaesthesia records it appears his A.
   fib was in the 100-120 range, he received a total of 9L NS as mentioned
   above as well as 2u PRBC. He received Diltiazem 120mg SR at [**2033**] with
   his rate responding 85-103. Pt currently NPO post-op and unable to
   receive meds. On review it appears pt required Amiodarone 150mg bolus
   and drip. Pt with rate in 120s on amio gtt, stable BPs. 1 dose of IV
   dilt did not improve rate significantly and it dropped BP. Volume
   overload may be contributing to difficulty with rate control. EKG this
   AM continues to show AF with RVR.
   - amiodarone gtt complete, did not start PO dosing still unclear if
   outpatient longterm amiodarone is best choice
   - trial IV dilt boluses, consider PO dosing if effective vs. dilt gtt
   if having BP issues
   - consider cardiology consult if refractory after dilt
   - restart warfarin
   - TBB goal -500 to 1L today (patient autodiuresing, can add Lasix prn)
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Pt received a total of 7L NS in the PACU over 7 hours but was still
   noted to have a BP in the mid 70s, asymptomatic. Thought to be [**2-17**] AF
   with RVR. On review of his record he has had septic shock after GU
   procedures as well as a history of VRE, pan sensitive E.Coli. Pt's BP
   also noted to decrease after Diltiazem 120mg was given. Changed abx of
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone to Ceftriaxone (given pansensitive in past for
   everything but VRE) and Linezolid (VRE coverage). Pt has baseline low
   BP in 100s. Does not appear to be infected.

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and chronic renal failure. He underwent an ileal conduit urinary diversion and is currently NPO. The patient's current condition includes narrow complex tachycardia, hypertension, and hypotension. He is receiving diltiazem IV and has had several IV boluses to control his heart rate. The patient is autodiuresing and has a fluid balance of -1185 mL over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of AF and current condition may lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, and thromboembolism.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be related to his chronic renal failure, hypovolemia, or medication side effects. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of his hypotension.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen due to his current condition, leading to further compromise of his renal function.
4. Hyperchloremic Acidosis: The patient's large volume resuscitation with normal saline may have caused hyperchloremic acidosis, which can lead to complications such as hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory depression.
5. Infection: The patient's history of septic shock and VRE colonization increases his risk of developing an infection, which can lead to further complications.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and arrhythmias.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status may worsen due to his chronic renal failure, leading to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's heart rate and rhythm closely and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
2. Further evaluate the patient's hypotension and determine the cause of his low blood pressure.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust his fluid management accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his medication regimen as needed to prevent hyperchloremic acidosis.
5. Monitor the patient's infection risk and take steps to prevent infections, such as maintaining good hand hygiene and using appropriate antibiotics.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust his medication regimen as needed to prevent cardiac complications.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust his oxygen therapy as needed to prevent respiratory complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 69-inch tall individual with atrial fibrillation (AF) and a history of acute pancreatitis with respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, and ileus. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated with various medications, including diltiazem, linezolid, ceftriaxone, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate. The patient has not had a bowel movement or flatus in 24 hours and has mild nausea.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with a SpO2 of 96% and an ABG of //24/. This may indicate that the patient is at risk for respiratory failure, which could worsen if not addressed promptly.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which may exacerbate the current situation. This could lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances.
3. Ileus: The patient's ileus is a significant concern, as it may lead to further complications, such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or abscess formation.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may increase the risk of embolic events, such as stroke or pulmonary embolism.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may indicate that the patient is at risk for dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process, which could worsen if not addressed promptly.
7. Stress Ulcer: The patient's ileus and chronic renal failure may increase the risk of stress ulceration, which could lead to bleeding and other complications.

Based on this information, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory results closely to ensure that the patient's condition does not deteriorate further."

   .
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Pt has history of A. fib with RVR post-op following a prior GU surgery
   performed in [**2127**]. On review of anaesthesia records it appears his A.
   fib was in the 100-120 range, he received a total of 9L NS as mentioned
   above as well as 2u PRBC. He received Diltiazem 120mg SR at [**2033**] with
   his rate responding 85-103. Initially NPO post-op and unable to receive
   meds. On review it appears pt required Amiodarone 150mg bolus and drip.
   Pt with rate in 120s on amio gtt, stable BPs.  Volume overload may be
   contributing to difficulty with rate control, with increased
   sympathetic tone post-op contributing.   Started dilt gtt yesterday
   with good response, optimal control.
   - per Cardiology, amio poor choice given h/o recurrent a. fib
   - cont dilt gtt with plan to transition to dilt 90 mg PO QID when
   cleared by Urology
   - appreciate Cardiology recs
   - restarted warfarin
   - cont to allow pt to autodiurese and improve atrial stretch
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Pt received a total of 7L NS in the PACU over 7 hours but was still
   noted to have a BP in the mid 70s, asymptomatic. Thought to be [**2-17**] AF
   with RVR. On review of his record he has had septic shock after GU
   procedures as well as a history of VRE, pan sensitive E.Coli. Pt's BP
   also noted to decrease after Diltiazem 120mg was given. Changed abx of
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone to Ceftriaxone (given pansensitive in past for
   everything but VRE) and Linezolid (VRE coverage). Pt has baseline low
   BP in 100s. Does not appear to be infected.   Cultures negative.
   Discontinued all antibiotics.  Hypotension resolved with improved rate
   control.
   .
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   s/p Ileal Conduit urinary diversion: Pt underwent  ileal conduit
   urinary diversion with removal of neobladder. Urology currently
   following pt, who is NPO per their recommendations.
   - f/u Urology recs
   - PO meds, clears when passing flatus
   - Morphine IV PRN for pain control
   - IS, OOB, ambulate
   .
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
   Renal Insufficiency: Pt currently sees a Nephrologist in [**Location (un) 755**] for
   his insufficiency. Prior to admission baseline Creatinine has ranged
   from 1.9-2.0. Prior Creatinine level of [**4-19**] was thought to be due to
   ATN from hypovolemia. Renal insufficiency is thought to be [**2-17**]
   obstruction from transitional bladder cell cancer with obstruction.
   - will check urine creatinine from JP drain
   .
   ##. Hyperchloremic Acidosis: Likely related to large volume
   resuscitation from NS.
   - resolved

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Pt has history of A. fib with RVR post-op following a prior GU surgery
   performed in [**2127**]. On review of anaesthesia records it appears his A.
   fib was in the 100-120 range, he received a total of 9L NS as mentioned
   above as well as 2u PRBC. He received Diltiazem 120mg SR at [**2033**] with
   his rate responding 85-103. Initially NPO post-op and unable to receive
   meds. On review it appears pt required Amiodarone 150mg bolus and drip.
   Pt with rate in 120s on amio gtt, stable BPs.  Volume overload may be
   contributing to difficulty with rate control, with increased
   sympathetic tone post-op contributing.   Started dilt gtt yesterday
   with good response, optimal control.
   - per Cardiology, amio poor choice given h/o recurrent a. fib
   - cont dilt gtt with plan to transition to dilt 90 mg PO QID when
   cleared by Urology
   - appreciate Cardiology recs
   - restarted warfarin
   - cont to allow pt to autodiurese and improve atrial stretch
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Pt received a total of 7L NS in the PACU over 7 hours but was still
   noted to have a BP in the mid 70s, asymptomatic. Thought to be [**2-17**] AF
   with RVR. On review of his record he has had septic shock after GU
   procedures as well as a history of VRE, pan sensitive E.Coli. Pt's BP
   also noted to decrease after Diltiazem 120mg was given. Changed abx of
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone to Ceftriaxone (given pansensitive in past for
   everything but VRE) and Linezolid (VRE coverage). Pt has baseline low
   BP in 100s. Does not appear to be infected.   Cultures negative.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-inch tall male with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) post-op following a gastrointestinal (GI) surgery. He has been admitted to the ICU for management of his AF and hypotension. He has been receiving diltiazem and morphine for rate control and pain management. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 143/39 mmHg. He has been experiencing no chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath.

The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency and has been seeing a nephrologist for his condition. He has also had a history of septic shock after GI procedures and has been treated for VRE and pan-sensitive E. coli.

The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and decreased platelet count. His creatinine level is 1.3 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 24 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a mild hypokalemia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of AF with RVR and his current symptoms of tachycardia and irregular heart rhythm make him at risk for further complications, such as stroke or heart failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's history of septic shock and his current symptoms of hypotension make him at risk for further complications, such as organ failure or death.
3. Renal failure: The patient's history of chronic renal insufficiency and his current symptoms of decreased urine output make him at risk for further complications, such as acute kidney injury or end-stage renal disease.
4. Infection: The patient's history of septic shock and his current symptoms of fever and chills make him at risk for further complications, such as sepsis or septic shock.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and his current symptoms of shortness of breath make him at risk for further complications, such as respiratory failure or pneumonia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to detect any changes or complications.
2. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with diltiazem and monitor his heart rate and rhythm.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hypotension with fluids and vasopressors as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and electrolyte levels closely to detect any changes or complications.
5. Consider transferring the patient to a step-down unit or a medical ward for further management and monitoring."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   .
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Pt has history of A. fib with RVR post-op following a prior GU surgery
   performed in [**2127**]. On review of anaesthesia records it appears his A.
   fib was in the 100-120 range, he received a total of 9L NS as mentioned
   above as well as 2u PRBC. He received Diltiazem 120mg SR at [**2033**] with
   his rate responding 85-103. Initially NPO post-op and unable to receive
   meds. On review it appeared pt required Amiodarone 150mg bolus and
   drip. Pt with rate in 120s on amio gtt, stable BPs.  Volume overload
   may be contributing to difficulty with rate control, with increased
   sympathetic tone post-op contributing.   Started dilt gtt yesterday
   with good response, optimal control.  Now discontinued dilt gtt,
   converted to and increased dilt to 120 mg PO QID
   - per Cardiology, amio poor choice given h/o recurrent a. fib
   - dilt 120 mg PO QID
   - appreciate Cardiology recs
   - cont warfarin
   - cont to allow pt to autodiurese and improve atrial stretch
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Pt received a total of 7L NS in the PACU over 7 hours but was still
   noted to have a BP in the mid 70s, asymptomatic. Thought to be [**2-17**] AF
   with RVR. On review of his record he has had septic shock after GU
   procedures as well as a history of VRE, pan sensitive E.Coli. Pt's BP
   also noted to decrease after Diltiazem 120mg was given. Changed abx of
   Vanc and Ceftriaxone to Ceftriaxone (given pansensitive in past for
   everything but VRE) and Linezolid (VRE coverage). Pt has baseline low
   BP in 100s. Does not appear to be infected.   Cultures negative.
   Discontinued all antibiotics.  Hypotension resolved with improved rate
   control.

   his insufficiency. Prior to admission baseline Creatinine has ranged
   from 1.9-2.0. Prior Creatinine level of [**4-19**] was thought to be due to
   ATN from hypovolemia. Renal insufficiency is thought to be [**2-17**]
   obstruction from transitional bladder cell cancer with obstruction.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and renal insufficiency. He underwent an ileal conduit urinary diversion and removal of neobladder. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 91 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 143/39 mmHg. He has a history of septic shock after GU procedures and has been treated with antibiotics, including Vanc and Ceftriaxone. The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is currently receiving warfarin for DVT prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of AF and current atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) may lead to complications such as heart failure, stroke, and embolism.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal insufficiency and current elevated creatinine level may lead to complications such as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hyperchloremic Acidosis: The patient's large volume resuscitation with normal saline may have contributed to his hyperchloremic acidosis, which has been resolved.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's limited PO intake and output may have contributed to his hypernatremia, which is expected to improve with clears.
5. VRE: The patient's history of VRE and current antibiotic treatment may lead to complications such as VRE colonization and infection.
6. Pan-sensitive E. coli: The patient's history of pan-sensitive E. coli and current antibiotic treatment may lead to complications such as E. coli infection and sepsis.
7. Hypotension: The patient's baseline low blood pressure and history of septic shock may lead to complications such as hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and cardiac rhythm.
2. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with diltiazem and warfarin.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust antibiotic treatment as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's VRE and pan-sensitive E. coli.
6. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's hypotension and potential septic shock.
7. Continue to follow the patient's urology and nephrology recommendations."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 40-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, and recent ileal conduit urinary diversion. He was started on diltiazem 120mg, but due to bradycardia, the dose was reduced to 90mg PO QID. The patient has a history of septic shock and VRE, and was empirically treated with Ceftriaxone and Linezolid. He has not passed flatus post-op and is on sips of clears only.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* Heart rate: 69 bpm (normal range 48-127 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 117/69 mmHg (normal range 81-135/45-99 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 12 inspirations per minute (normal range 8-28 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is receiving fluid therapy, and his fluid balance is negative 905 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.6-9.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 192-243 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.3-1.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 90-126 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Potassium 3.5 mEq/L, sodium 142 mEq/L, chloride 26 mEq/L, calcium 7.8 mg/dL, magnesium 2.0 mg/dL, phosphate 2.5 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which may lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, and thromboembolism.
2. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which may worsen during his hospital stay, leading to acute kidney injury and the need for dialysis.
3. Ileus: The patient has not passed flatus post-op, which may lead to complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, and sepsis.
4. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension, which may recur during his hospital stay, leading to complications such as shock, organ failure, and death.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of septic shock and VRE, which may lead to complications such as sepsis, organ failure, and death.
6. Bleeding: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may lead to complications such as muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   Pt has history of A. fib with RVR post-op following a prior GU surgery
   performed in [**2127**]. Patient was initially controlled on  amiodarone
   150mg bolus and drip, as he had during prior course. Pt was 7L positive
   after OR, and volume overload may have contributed to difficulty with
   rate control, with increased sympathetic tone post-op.   Was on dilt
   gtt and now is converted to dilt to 90 mg PO [**Year (4 digits) 1014**]. Got one dose 120 mg
   dilt yesterday and became bradycardic to 40s, asymptomatic.
   - dilt 90 mg PO [**Name (NI) 1014**]
   - pt autodiuresing, goal negative 500-1000cc
   - INR supratherapeutic today, hold coumadin
   .
   ##. HCT DROP: Concerning in setting of elevated INR. AB exam unchanged
   and no GI bleeding.
   - monitor [**Hospital1 7**] Hcts
   .
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Pt received a total of 7L NS in the PACU over 7 hours but was still
   noted to have a BP in the mid 70s, asymptomatic. Thought to be [**2-17**] AF
   with RVR. On review of his record he has had septic shock after GU
   procedures as well as a history of VRE, pan sensitive E.Coli. Pt
   received empiric Ceftriaxone (given pansensitive in past for everything
   but VRE) and Linezolid (VRE coverage) peri-op. Cx remained negative and
   discontinued all antibiotics.  Hypotension resolved with improved rate
   control.
   .
 CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER
   s/p Ileal Conduit urinary diversion: Pt underwent  ileal conduit
   urinary diversion with removal of neobladder. Urology currently
   following pt, who is on sips per their recommendations.
   - f/u Urology recs
   - PO meds, sips, encourage ambulation
   - MSIR for pain control
   - IS, OOB, ambulate

 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
   Renal Insufficiency: Pt currently sees a Nephrologist in [**Location (un) 755**] for
   his insufficiency. Prior to admission baseline Creatinine has ranged
   from 1.9-2.0. Prior Creatinine level of [**4-19**] was thought to be due to
   ATN from hypovolemia. Renal insufficiency is thought to be [**2-17**]
   obstruction from transitional bladder cell cancer with obstruction.
   .
   ##. ILEUS: Patient has not passed flatus post-op. Per urology, there
   were many adhesions and parts of bowel had to be dissected free from
   peritoneum, so not surprising to have ileus. He should remain on only
   sips of clears.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 40-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic renal failure, and a recent ileal conduit urinary diversion following a GU surgery. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and bradycardia after an increased dose of diltiazem (120mg) was held, and his afternoon dose was resumed at 90mg overnight.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 69bpm, and blood pressure of 117/69mmHg. His respiratory rate is 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air.

The patient has a history of AF with RVR post-op, and his current ECG shows irregularly irregular heart rhythm. His physical examination is unremarkable, with no acute distress, and his neurological examination is normal.

Laboratory results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated INR. His creatinine level is 1.3mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 26mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes a history of septic shock after GU procedures, as well as a history of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) and pan-sensitive Escherichia coli (E. coli). He has undergone an ileal conduit urinary diversion and is currently being followed by urology.

The patient's current medications include diltiazem 90mg PO, pantoprazole 40mg IV, and morphine sulfate 2mg IV. He is also receiving warfarin for DVT prophylaxis and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of atrial fibrillation: The patient's current ECG shows irregularly irregular heart rhythm, which may worsen if not controlled.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and his BUN level is high, which may indicate worsening renal failure.
3. Bleeding: The patient's INR is supratherapeutic, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Ileus: The patient has not passed flatus post-op, which may indicate the development of ileus.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of septic shock and VRE, which may increase the risk of infection.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of AF and RVR post-op may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

Based on the patient's current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination to detect any potential complications early and intervene promptly."
