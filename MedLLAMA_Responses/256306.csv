You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of cirrhosis of the liver, chronic renal failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. They have experienced an episode of hypotension while sleeping, which resolved with bolus fluids. An ultrasound revealed multiple stones in the gallbladder, an enlarged spleen, and moderate ascites. Stool studies have been sent. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1Â°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 65/34 mmHg. They are receiving IV fluids and have a central venous catheter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis progression: The patient's sepsis without organ dysfunction may progress to septic shock, which can lead to multi-organ failure.
2. Renal failure exacerbation: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen due to inadequate fluid management, sepsis, or other factors.
3. Hepatic decompensation: The patient's cirrhosis of the liver may decompensate, leading to worsening liver function, ascites, and encephalopathy.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal tract is at risk for bleeding due to portal hypertension, ascites, and potential sepsis.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to sepsis, ascites, or other factors, leading to the need for mechanical ventilation.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's liver disease may lead to coagulopathy, increasing the risk of bleeding.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's chronic kidney disease and liver disease may lead to electrolyte imbalances, which can affect cardiac function and other organ systems.
8. Infection control: The patient's ICU stay increases the risk of hospital-acquired infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)."

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Patient more normotensive today.  Diarrhea losses probably
   larger than estimated and patient has chronic volume losses.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Continue flagyl/CTX for now (day #2)
   - Could check cortisol, TSH (not yet done)
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derrangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Lactate remains elevated but is trending
   down (now 3.8). Unifying diagnoses could include systemic amyloidosis
   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a history of ESRD on HD, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs. He was admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of weakness and confusion. The patient has a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days, and his partner reported a lack of appetite for the past few days. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a leukocytosis and elevated lactate, which raises concern for sepsis. He has a history of diarrhea, which is thought to be chronic but may have worsened recently, contributing to weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte abnormalities.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Sepsis:** The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of sepsis. The patient's temperature is normal, but his WBC count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection.
2. **Hepatic Encephalopathy:** The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and he has a history of cirrhosis, which may lead to hepatic encephalopathy.
3. **Renal Failure:** The patient has ESRD on HD, and his creatinine levels are elevated, which may indicate worsening renal function.
4. **Infection:** The patient's history of PEs and ascites may increase his risk of developing an infection.
5. **Malnutrition:** The patient's albumin levels are low, which may indicate malnutrition, which can contribute to weakness and other complications.
6. **Electrolyte Imbalance:** The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may lead to muscle weakness, arrhythmias, and other complications.
7. **Thrombocytopenia:** The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase his risk of bleeding.
8. **Diarrhea:** The patient's diarrhea is thought to be chronic but may have worsened recently, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, and other complications.
9. **Hypotension:** The patient's blood pressure is unstable, which may lead to organ dysfunction and other complications.
10. **Cognitive Impairment:** The patient's confusion and weakness may be related to his underlying medical conditions, such as liver and kidney failure, and may worsen if not addressed promptly.

**Plan:**

The patient's plan includes fluid boluses based on clinical exam and maintenance fluids to match losses, continuation of antibiotics, and further evaluation of the patient's diarrhea and potential infections. The patient's platelet count will be trended, and he will be repleted with electrolytes as needed. The patient's nutritional status will be further evaluated, and a nutrition consult will be obtained. The patient's code status will be discussed with him, and a full code will be implemented. The patient's disposition will be determined based on his clinical status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   was mentating well, given recent HD received gentle 250 cc bolus.

   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has
   had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute.

Summary:

The patient, a 74-year-old man with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites, was admitted to the ICU with complaints of weakness and confusion. He has had two episodes of hypotension overnight, with a lowest blood pressure of 51/32 mmHg. His laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. He has also had voluminous diarrhea and a history of chronic diarrhea. His troponin levels have been elevated, but the significance is unclear due to his ESRD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and leukocytosis raise concern for sepsis, particularly given his history of peritoneal dialysis and ascites.
2. Infection: The patient's diarrhea and elevated white count may indicate an underlying infection, which could be contributing to his weakness and hypotension.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Although the patient's ammonia levels are low, his liver function tests are abnormal, and he has a history of cirrhosis, which may contribute to his encephalopathy.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD and history of dialysis may be contributing to his weakness and electrolyte abnormalities.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be due to splenic sequestration or another underlying cause.
6. Diarrhea: The patient's chronic diarrhea may be contributing to his electrolyte abnormalities, weakness, and hypotension.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in his electrolyte levels, which may be contributing to his weakness and hypotension.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels may indicate cardiac damage, although the significance is unclear due to his ESRD.
9. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and his current respiratory support may increase his risk of pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Administer antibiotics and antifungals as necessary to treat potential infections.
3. Consider diagnostic paracentesis to evaluate the patient's ascites.
4. Trend the patient's lactate levels and electrolyte abnormalities.
5. Continue to provide supportive care, including fluid replacement and electrolyte repletion.
6. Consider a nutrition consult to optimize the patient's nutrition and hydration.
7. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusions if necessary.
8. Consider a GI consult to evaluate the patient's diarrhea and potential underlying causes.
9. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider further testing if necessary."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] re: utility of fat pad biopsy for amyloidosis.
   Briefly, he feels that amyloid is not likely secondary to ERSD, but
   that pt could have systemic amyloid of other etiology. Does not feel bx
   is urgent. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] does advise consulting GI re: mgmt of diarrhea as
   he feels the diarrhea is contributing to current sx and compromising
   overall care (pt unable to make it through an HD session without pause
   to use bathroom). Recommends considering contacting Dr. [**Name (NI) 2912**] (pt's
   hepatologist) as he may also have input.
   - Left message with dental service requesting advice on loose partial
   denture (no response yet)
   -Patient complaining of left shoulder pain today, reportedly after fall
   several days ago prior to admission.  Plain films obtained that showed
   distal clavicular fracture with superior displacement, subluxation of

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Spoke with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] re: utility of fat pad biopsy for amyloidosis.
   Briefly, he feels that amyloid is not likely secondary to ERSD, but
   that pt could have systemic amyloid of other etiology. Does not feel bx
   is urgent. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] does advise consulting GI re: mgmt of diarrhea as
   he feels the diarrhea is contributing to current sx and compromising
   overall care (pt unable to make it through an HD session without pause
   to use bathroom). Recommends considering contacting Dr. [**Name (NI) 2912**] (pt's

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Patient more normotensive today.  Diarrhea losses probably
   larger than estimated and patient has chronic volume losses.  Per Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are consistent with patient
   baseline and not cause for special concern or pressors.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Stop flagyl/CTX
   - f/u  cortisol, TSH
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Lactate remains elevated but is trending
   down (now 3.8). Unifying diagnoses could include systemic amyloidosis
   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has
   had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Consider diagnostic paracentesis given ascites on US if abdominal pain
   or persistent sx
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   -Trend lactate
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition consult
   - Consider fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   1.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - resend other stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   - If stool studies negative, stop antibiotics.
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 51 which is lower than it
   has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may have a
   component of splenic sequestration, given known history of portal
   hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Message left with dental consult.
   #ESRD. Plan for HD today.
   # FEN: prn IVF, replete electrolytes aggressively,  Renal Diet

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history, including ESRD on hemodialysis (HD), cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, as well as pulmonary embolism (PE). He was admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of weakness and confusion.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5Â°C (97.7Â°F), heart rate of 89 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 71/49 mmHg. His respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 15 inspirations per minute (ins/min). His oxygen saturation is not mentioned in the note.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels (3.8 mmol/L) and leukocytosis (9.0 x 10^9/L), which raise concern for sepsis. His troponin levels are elevated (0.24 ng/mL), but the cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB) are within normal limits. His liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated ALT and AST levels, suggesting liver dysfunction.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a distal clavicular fracture with superior displacement and subluxation of the humeral head, which was diagnosed on plain films. He also has a loose partial denture, which may be contributing to his mouth pain.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Fluid boluses based on clinical exam and maintenance fluids to match losses.
2. Bolus normal saline for blood pressures <70 mmHg.
3. Renal team will monitor fluid status and blood pressure carefully with HD sessions.
4. Stop metronidazole and ceftriaxone.
5. Follow-up blood cultures and stool studies.
6. Consider diagnostic paracentesis for ascites.
7. Trend lactate levels.
8. Electrolyte repletion as needed.
9. Appreciate renal recommendations.
10. Follow-up nutrition consult.
11. Consider fat pad biopsy to evaluate for amyloidosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and leukocytosis raise concern for sepsis.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and elevated lactate levels suggest liver dysfunction, which may be contributing to his confusion and weakness.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's chronic diarrhea and ascites may lead to electrolyte imbalances, which can further complicate his condition.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels suggest infection, which may be contributing to his weakness and confusion.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and history of ESRD may increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his complex medical conditions to prevent potential complications and optimize his care."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and the physician is considering the possibility of systemic amyloidosis as a potential underlying cause. The patient has been experiencing diarrhea, which is compromising their overall care and ability to tolerate hemodialysis sessions.

The patient has also suffered a left shoulder injury, including a distal clavicular fracture with superior displacement and subluxation of the humeral head. An orthopedic consult has been requested, and the patient is currently using a sling for comfort.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, and blood pressure of 71/49 mmHg. They are receiving IV fluids and have a fluid balance of 2,417 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of ongoing kidney damage, with a creatinine level of 5.2 mg/dL. They also have elevated liver enzymes, including ALT and AST, and an abnormal troponin-T level.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septicemia due to the patient's immunocompromised state and ongoing kidney damage.
2. Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying lung disease and potential development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, due to the patient's pre-existing cardiac disease and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's diarrhea and potential gastrointestinal ulcers.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's immobility and underlying medical conditions.
6. Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy or acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the patient's ongoing inflammatory response.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Patient more normotensive today.  Diarrhea losses probably
   larger than estimated and patient has chronic volume losses.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Continue flagyl/CTX for now (day #3)
   - f/u  cortisol, TSH
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Lactate remains elevated but is trending
   down (now 3.8). Unifying diagnoses could include systemic amyloidosis
   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has
   had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Consider diagnostic paracentesis given ascites on US if abdominal pain
   or persistent sx
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   -Trend lactate
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   -Continue Abx for now
   - F/U Nutrition consult
   - Consider fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   1.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - resend other stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   - If stool studies negative, stop antibiotics.
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 51 which is lower than it
   has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may have a
   component of splenic sequestration, given known history of portal
   hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Message left with dental consult.
   # FEN: prn IVF, replete electrolytes aggressively,  Renal Diet
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   # Disposition: Call out to floor if not extremely hypotensive.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Patient more normotensive today.  Diarrhea losses probably
   larger than estimated and patient has chronic volume losses.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Continue flagyl/CTX for now (day #3)
   - f/u  cortisol, TSH
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Lactate remains elevated but is trending
   down (now 3.8). Unifying diagnoses could include systemic amyloidosis
   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has
   had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Consider diagnostic paracentesis given ascites on US if abdominal pain
   or persistent sx
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   -Trend lactate
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   -Continue Abx for now
   - F/U Nutrition consult
   - Consider fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   1.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - resend other stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   - If stool studies negative, stop antibiotics.
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.

   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 51 which is lower than it
   has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may have a

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of ESRD on hemodialysis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs. He was admitted to the ICU with complaints of weakness and confusion. His vital signs are stable, but he has a leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and hypotension. He is also experiencing diarrhea, which is likely contributing to his weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte abnormalities. His troponin levels are elevated, but his CK levels are flat, suggesting no acute/evolving process. He has thrombocytopenia, which may be related to splenic sequestration. He also has a distal clavicular fracture with superior displacement and subluxation of the humeral head, which is being managed with a sling.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels raise concern for sepsis, particularly given his history of PEs and ascites.
2. Infection: The patient's diarrhea and elevated lactate levels suggest the possibility of an infectious process, which could be contributing to his weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte abnormalities.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of cirrhosis and ascites makes it possible that he is experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, which could be contributing to his confusion and weakness.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's history of ESRD and current hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities raise concern for acute kidney injury or worsening of his underlying chronic kidney disease.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's diarrhea and vomiting are likely contributing to his electrolyte abnormalities, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications if not managed promptly.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be related to splenic sequestration, but it also raises concern for bleeding complications, particularly given his history of PEs and ascites.
7. Fracture Complications: The patient's distal clavicular fracture with superior displacement and subluxation of the humeral head may lead to complications such as nonunion, malunion, or nerve damage if not managed properly.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to identify any potential complications and adjust management accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis.  Elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis but has normalized. Patient more hypotensive after HD and unable
   to be called out, but continues to mentate well.  Responeded to 250 cc
   bolus..  Diarrhea losses probably larger than estimated and patient has
   chronic volume losses.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are
   consistent with patient
s baseline and not cause for special concern or
   pressors. Cortisol at 3:00 AM = 22.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Off Abx
   - stopping midodrine today as no change in abx
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Unifying diagnoses could include systemic
   amyloidosis (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is
   [**Name2 (NI) 14361**] positive, but patient has historically refused testing).
   Patient has had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may
   contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   2. Still having multiple BM per day.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult for [**Last Name (un) **] with bxs once infectious workup negative
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   - restart loperamide today
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   # Clavicle fracture: Sling for comfort per ortho recs. Activity as
   tolerated. Pain control appropriate at this time
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 47 from 51 which is lower
   than it has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may
   have a component of splenic sequestration, given known history of
   portal hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Keep dentures out when possible per dental recs

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs. He was admitted to the ICU from the ED with complaints of weakness and confusion. He has been experiencing hypotension, diarrhea, and elevated troponin levels. His troponins have been flat, suggesting no acute/evolving process. He has a history of clavicle fracture and thrombocytopenia. He is being treated with fluid boluses, maintenance fluids, and electrolyte repletion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and leukocytosis raise concerns for sepsis. A comprehensive infectious workup is necessary to identify the source of infection.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Although the patient's ammonia level is low, and there is no asterixis on exam, hepatic encephalopathy cannot be ruled out entirely. The patient's history of liver failure and ascites increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's diarrhea and chronic volume losses may lead to electrolyte imbalances, which can exacerbate his weakness and confusion.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which may be due to splenic sequestration. Regular monitoring of platelet counts is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
5. Infection: The patient's history of PEs and portal hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) increases the risk of infection. A comprehensive infectious workup is necessary to identify the source of infection.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's albumin level is significantly lower than normal, which may contribute to his weakness and confusion. A nutrition consult is necessary to optimize his nutritional status.
7. Amyloidosis: The patient's history of ESRD and portal hypertension increases the risk of systemic amyloidosis. A fat pad biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
8. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's diarrhea and history of ileal resection increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Regular monitoring of stool studies and abdominal exams is necessary to detect any bleeding complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, electrolyte levels, and platelet count.
2. Complete a comprehensive infectious workup to identify the source of infection.
3. Optimize the patient's nutritional status with a nutrition consult.
4. Consider a fat pad biopsy to evaluate for systemic amyloidosis.
5. Monitor the patient's stool studies and abdominal exams regularly to detect any bleeding complications.
6. Consider a GI consult for further evaluation and management of the patient's diarrhea.
7. Restart loperamide and consider octreotide or tincture of opium if stool studies are negative.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's troponin levels and EKGs to detect any changes suggestive of evolving infarct."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis.  Elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis but has normalized. Patient more hypotensive after HD and unable
   to be called out, but continues to mentate well.  Responeded to 250 cc
   bolus..  Diarrhea losses probably larger than estimated and patient has
   chronic volume losses.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are
   consistent with patient
s baseline and not cause for special concern or
   pressors. Cortisol at 3:00 AM = 22.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Off Abx
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Unifying diagnoses could include systemic
   amyloidosis (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is
   [**Name2 (NI) 14361**] positive, but patient has historically refused testing).
   Patient has had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may
   contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   2. Still having multiple BM per day.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   or restart loperamide
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   # Clavicle fracture: Sling for comfort per ortho recs. Activity as
   tolerated. Pain control appropriate at this time
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 47 from 51 which is lower
   than it has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may
   have a component of splenic sequestration, given known history of
   portal hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Keep dentures out when possible per dental recs
   - Orabase PRN for mouth pain
   - Consider Peridex rinse if lesions develop (antimicrobial) per dental
   recs
   #ESRD. Plan for HD Tuesday.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and leukocytosis raise concern for sepsis, although it has normalized. The patient's history of chronic volume losses, diarrhea, and possible peritoneal, blood, pulmonary, or biliary source infection increases the risk of sepsis.
2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension, despite fluid boluses, may indicate a underlying condition such as sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, or volume depletion.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's voluminous diarrhea, which is chronic but possibly worsening, can lead to electrolyte abnormalities, dehydration, and malnutrition, exacerbating weakness and hypotension.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's declining platelet count may indicate a component of splenic sequestration due to portal hypertension sequelae and splenomegaly on US.
5. ESRD: The patient's chronic kidney disease and ESRD increase the risk of electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload, and malnutrition, which can worsen the patient's overall condition.
6. Liver failure: The patient's cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis may indicate liver failure, which can cause metabolic derangements, encephalopathy, and electrolyte abnormalities.
7. PEs: The patient's history of PEs increases the risk of recurrent PEs, which can lead to respiratory and cardiac complications.
8. Systemic amyloidosis: The patient's history of PEs and the renal team's concern for systemic amyloidosis may indicate a underlying condition that can cause multi-organ dysfunction.
9. HIV: The patient's partner's positive HIV status and the patient's historical refusal of HIV testing raise concern for potential HIV infection, which can cause immunosuppression and increase the risk of opportunistic infections.

The patient's plan of care includes fluid boluses based on clinical exam and maintenance fluids to match losses, bolus NS for BPs <70, and careful monitoring of fluid status and BP with HD sessions. The patient will also require further evaluation and management of diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and ESRD."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour event in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is dental recs, and they were called out to the floor but rejected due to concerns over systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 60s-70s range. The patient was tachycardic to 110s-120s post-hemodialysis (HD) and was given a 250cc bolus of IV fluid, which brought their heart rate down.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.6Â°C (97.9Â°F)
* Heart rate: 95 (84-123) beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 72/45 mmHg (51-196/151 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 17 (12-23) inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.0-11.0 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 37.7-46.2%
* Platelet count: 47-64 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.7-5.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.21-0.24 ng/mL
* Glucose: 88-152 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, lactate acid, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

* Septic shock due to the patient's tachycardia and hypotension
* Acute kidney injury (AKI) or worsening of existing kidney disease due to the patient's elevated creatinine levels
* Cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's tachycardia and troponin-T elevation
* Infection or sepsis due to the patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate acid levels
* Nutritional deficiencies or malnutrition due to the patient's lack of oral intake and potential gastrointestinal (GI) issues
* Venous thromboembolism (VTE) or deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to the patient's immobility and potential risk factors

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour event in the ICU, with a history of dental procedures, including the removal of partial dentures, and antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and metronidazole. The patient was tachycardic post-HD and received a 250cc bolus of IVF to stabilize their heart rate. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 72/45 mmHg. The patient is receiving respiratory support, but not on oxygen therapy. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with no signs of respiratory distress or cardiovascular instability.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's dental procedures and antibiotic therapy increase the risk of infection, particularly in the mouth and respiratory tract.
2. Sepsis: The patient's tachycardia and low blood pressure post-HD may indicate sepsis, which could be exacerbated by the dental procedures and antibiotic therapy.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's tachycardia and low blood pressure may indicate cardiac instability, which could be exacerbated by the dental procedures and antibiotic therapy.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory support and low oxygen saturation may indicate respiratory instability, which could be exacerbated by the dental procedures and antibiotic therapy.
5. Nutritional Complications: The patient's inability to tolerate oral feedings and need for IV nutrition may lead to malnutrition and related complications.
6. Wound Complications: The patient's dental procedures and antibiotic therapy may increase the risk of wound complications, such as infection and delayed healing.

Based on this information, it is recommended that the patient's medical team closely monitor their vital signs, respiratory status, and nutritional intake, and consider adjusting their antibiotic therapy and nutritional support as necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Patient more normotensive today.  Diarrhea losses probably
   larger than estimated and patient has chronic volume losses.  Per Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are consistent with patient
   baseline and not cause for special concern or pressors. Cortisol at
   3:00 AM = 22.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Off Abx
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Lactate remains elevated but is trending
   down (now 3.8). Unifying diagnoses could include systemic amyloidosis
   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has
   had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Consider diagnostic paracentesis given ascites on US if abdominal pain
   or persistent sx
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   -Trend lactate
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   2. Still having multiple BM per day.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   - If stool studies negative, stop antibiotics.
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   or restart loperamide
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 51 which is lower than it
   has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may have a
   component of splenic sequestration, given known history of portal
   hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Keep dentures out when possible per dental recs
   - Orabase PRN for mouth pain
   - Consider Peridex rinse if lesions develop (antimicrobial) per dental
   recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2106-5-8**]:
   - Dental recs: Take out partial dentures permanently until mouth heals,
   or use only with meals if needed. Continue Orabase paste for mouth
   pain. Consider Peridex (sp?) mouth rinse if lesions develop
   (antimicrobial).
   - Called out to floor, got a bed, but rejected by floor team based on
   perceived nursing concern over SBPs in 60s-70s (patient was low to this
   range post-HD). So back in unit.
   - Tachycardic to 110s-120s post-HD, came down with 250 cc bolus of IVF

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cryptogenic cirrhosis, ascites, and peripheral edema. He was admitted to the ICU with complaints of weakness and confusion.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6Â°C (97.9Â°F), heart rate of 95 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 72/45 mmHg. He is tachycardic and has a low blood pressure, which may be related to his underlying medical conditions.

The patient's laboratory results show a leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and low albumin levels, which may indicate sepsis or infection. His troponin levels are elevated, but the trend is flat, which may suggest a new baseline in the setting of ESRD. His platelet count is low, which may be related to splenic sequestration or portal hypertension sequelae.

The patient has a history of diarrhea, which may be contributing to his weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte abnormalities. He has a chronic volume loss due to his ascites and chronic diarrhea, which may require ongoing fluid management.

The patient's medical plan includes ongoing fluid boluses based on clinical exam and maintenance fluids to match losses, as well as bolus normal saline for blood pressures < 70 mmHg. He will also require ongoing monitoring of his fluid status and blood pressure with HD sessions.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis or infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels may indicate sepsis or infection, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be related to his underlying medical conditions or may be a sign of sepsis or infection.
3. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient's low albumin levels and chronic volume loss may lead to electrolyte abnormalities, which could exacerbate his underlying medical conditions.
4. Diarrhea: The patient's chronic diarrhea may continue to contribute to his weakness, hypotension, and electrolyte abnormalities.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of portal hypertension sequelae.
6. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's elevated lactate levels and low albumin levels may indicate hepatic encephalopathy, which could lead to further deterioration in his neurological status.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying medical conditions, including his chronic diarrhea and ascites, may increase the risk of respiratory failure.

In summary, the patient requires ongoing close monitoring and management of his underlying medical conditions, as well as aggressive fluid management and electrolyte repletion to prevent complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis and elevated lactate which raise concern for
   sepsis. Patient more normotensive today.  Diarrhea losses probably
   larger than estimated and patient has chronic volume losses.  Per Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are consistent with patient
   baseline and not cause for special concern or pressors. Cortisol at
   3:00 AM = 22.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Off Abx
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Lactate remains elevated but is trending
   down (now 3.8). Unifying diagnoses could include systemic amyloidosis
   (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is [**Name2 (NI) 14361**]
   positive, but patient has historically refused testing). Patient has
   had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Consider diagnostic paracentesis given ascites on US if abdominal pain
   or persistent sx
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   -Trend lactate
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   2. Still having multiple BM per day.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult
   - If stool studies negative, stop antibiotics.
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   or restart loperamide
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   # Clavicle fracture: Sling for comfort per ortho recs. Activity as
   tolerated.
   - F/U final read of plain films
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 51 which is lower than it
   has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may have a
   component of splenic sequestration, given known history of portal
   hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Keep dentures out when possible per dental recs
   - Orabase PRN for mouth pain
   - Consider Peridex rinse if lesions develop (antimicrobial) per dental
   recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, and pulmonary embolism (PE) who was admitted to the ICU with complaints of weakness and confusion. He has been experiencing diarrhea, and his blood cultures are pending. His troponin levels have been elevated, but his CK levels are flat, suggesting no acute or evolving process. He has a clavicle fracture and thrombocytopenia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the 70s, and his respiratory status is stable on room air.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels raise concern for sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 70s, which may be a concern, especially if it is not controlled. Hypotension can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's diarrhea and vomiting may lead to electrolyte imbalances, which can cause muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications.
4. Infection: The patient's diarrhea and blood cultures are pending, and the patient may be at risk for infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if he has any invasive procedures or trauma.
6. Liver Failure: The patient's history of cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites may indicate liver failure, which can lead to encephalopathy, bleeding, and other complications.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's history of ESRD and his current kidney function may indicate renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and other complications.
8. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's history of PE may indicate a high risk for recurrent embolism, which can lead to respiratory failure and other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, closely.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his fluid and electrolyte replacement as needed.
3. Consider starting antibiotics if the patient's blood cultures are positive.
4. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusing platelets if it drops below 50,000.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider starting lactulose if his liver function is compromised.
6. Consider starting dialysis if the patient's kidney function is compromised.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if he becomes unstable.
8. Consider starting anticoagulation therapy to prevent recurrent pulmonary embolism."

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis.  Elevated lactate which raised concern for
   sepsis but has normalized. Patient more hypotensive after HD and unable
   to be called out, but continues to mentate well.  Responded to 250 cc
   bolus..  Diarrhea losses probably larger than estimated and patient has
   chronic volume losses.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are
   consistent with patient
s baseline and not cause for special concern or
   pressors. Cortisol at 3:00 AM = 22.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Off Abx without change
   - stopped midodrine yesterday as no change in abx
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Unifying diagnoses could include systemic
   amyloidosis (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is
   [**Name2 (NI) 14361**] positive, but patient has historically refused testing).
   Patient has had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may
   contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   2. Still having multiple BM per day.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult for [**Last Name (un) **] with bxs once infectious workup negative
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   - restart loperamide today
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   # Clavicle fracture: Sling for comfort per ortho recs. Activity as
   tolerated. Pain control appropriate at this time
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 47 from 51 which is lower
   than it has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may
   have a component of splenic sequestration, given known history of
   portal hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Keep dentures out when possible per dental recs
   - Orabase PRN for mouth pain
   - Consider Peridex rinse if lesions develop (antimicrobial) per dental
   recs
   #ESRD. Plan for HD Tuesday, follow up renal recs.
   # FEN: prn IVF, replete electrolytes aggressively,  Renal Diet
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   # Disposition: Likely stay in ICU for now given low BPs, consider call
   out as his BPs are stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old gentleman with a history of ESRD on HD, cryptogenic cirrhosis, and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who is admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of weakness and confusion. He has a leukocytosis, elevated lactate, and diarrhea, and is experiencing hypotension. His troponins are elevated, but the levels are flat, and his CKs are stable, suggesting no acute or evolving process. He has a clavicle fracture and is experiencing mouth pain, which is likely due to denture malalignment.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated lactate levels raise concern for sepsis, particularly given his history of PEs and ascites.
2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure and ascites increase the risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which could exacerbate his weakness and confusion.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's diarrhea and vomiting may lead to electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypochloremia, which could worsen his weakness and hypotension.
4. Infection: The patient's history of PEs and ascites increases the risk of infection, particularly peritoneal, blood, pulmonary, or biliary infections.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition, as evidenced by his low albumin levels, may contribute to his weakness and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Amyloidosis: The patient's history of ESRD and PEs raises concern for systemic amyloidosis, which could be contributing to his weakness and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Volume Depletion: The patient's diarrhea and vomiting may lead to volume depletion, which could worsen his hypotension and electrolyte imbalances.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, particularly his blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Continue to administer fluids and electrolytes as needed to maintain normal serum levels.
3. Consider ordering additional laboratory tests, such as a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and liver function tests, to further evaluate the patient's condition.
4. Consider consulting with a gastroenterologist to evaluate the patient's diarrhea and potential causes.
5. Consider consulting with a nephrologist to evaluate the patient's ESRD and potential causes of his weakness and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Consider ordering a fat pad biopsy to evaluate for amyloidosis.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust his treatment plan as needed to ensure his comfort and safety."

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis.  Elevated lactate which raised concern for
   sepsis but has normalized. Patient more hypotensive after HD and unable
   to be called out, but continues to mentate well.  Responded to 250 cc
   bolus..  Diarrhea losses probably larger than estimated and patient has
   chronic volume losses.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are
   consistent with patient
s baseline and not cause for special concern or
   pressors. Cortisol at 3:00 AM = 22.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Off Abx without change
   - stopped midodrine yesterday as no change in abx
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Unifying diagnoses could include systemic
   amyloidosis (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is
   [**Name2 (NI) 14361**] positive, but patient has historically refused testing).
   Patient has had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may
   contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   2. Still having multiple BM per day.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult for [**Last Name (un) **] with bxs once infectious workup negative
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   - restart loperamide today
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   # Clavicle fracture: Sling for comfort per ortho recs. Activity as
   tolerated. Pain control appropriate at this time
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 47 from 51 which is lower
   than it has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may
   have a component of splenic sequestration, given known history of
   portal hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Keep dentures out when possible per dental recs
   - Orabase PRN for mouth pain
   - Consider Peridex rinse if lesions develop (antimicrobial) per dental

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. of ESRD on HD (last dialysis [**5-6**]),
   cryptogenic cirrhosis and ascites requiring paracentesis, and PEs who
   is admitted from the ED with chief complaint of weakness and
   confusion.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Pt is mentating well and does not produce urine. Per
   outpatient records, baseline BP is in 70's systolic. Pt is afebrile but
   does have a leukocytosis.  Elevated lactate which raised concern for
   sepsis but has normalized. Patient more hypotensive after HD and unable
   to be called out, but continues to mentate well.  Responded to 250 cc
   bolus..  Diarrhea losses probably larger than estimated and patient has
   chronic volume losses.  Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3482**] of nephrology, SBPs in 70s are
   consistent with patient
s baseline and not cause for special concern or
   pressors. Cortisol at 3:00 AM = 22.
   - Fluid boluses based upon clinical exam and maintenance fluids to
   match losses.
   - Bolus NS for BPs<70; renal team will monitor fluid status/BP
   carefully with HD sessions
   - F/U BCx - NGTD
   - Off Abx without change
   - stopped midodrine yesterday as no change in abx
   .
   # WEAKNESS/CONFUSION: Patient was brought into the ED by his partner
   who related a history of weakness and confusion for the past 3 days.
   Patient states that he has had a lack of appetite for the past few
   days. Possibilites for weakness and confusion in this patient include
   metabolic derangements (likely from liver failure and hepatic
   encephalopathy or renal failure, though less likely as dialysis was
   yesterday), infection (high white count, increased lactate) from
   peritoneal, blood, pulmonary or biliary source. Albumin is
   significantly lower at 2.4 than it was in [**Last Name (LF) 25**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] malnutrition may
   be contributing to weakness. Unifying diagnoses could include systemic
   amyloidosis (concern expressed by renal team) vs. HIV (partner is
   [**Name2 (NI) 14361**] positive, but patient has historically refused testing).
   Patient has had frequent electrolyte abnormalities, which may
   contribute.
   -F/U blood cultures  (NGTD)
   -Ammonia level low (25), and no asterixis on exam so hepatic
   encephalopthay seem unlikely.
   - Electrolytes [**Hospital1 7**] with repletion PRN
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - F/U Nutrition recs
   - Fat pad bx to evaluate for amyloidosis on hold for now
   .
   # DIARRHEA: Patient reports voluminous diarrhea, and has a history of
   having diarrhea with up to 5 liters daily. Previously the patient's
   diarrhea was thought to be the result of ileal resection. This has been
   a chronic issue but perhaps worse recently, and likely contributes to
   weakness, hypotension and electrolyte abnormalities. C. diff negative x
   2. Still having multiple BM per day.
   - Attempt to quantify volume of diarrhea
   - F/U stool studies (pending)
   - Consider GI consult for [**Last Name (un) **] with bxs once infectious workup negative
   - If stool studies negative, consider octreotide or tincture of opium
   - restart loperamide today
   # ELEVATED TROPONIN: Patient's troponins have been 0.21-0.25 (flat)
   which may be new baseline in setting of ESRD. Flat CKs suggest no
   acute/evolving process. Difficult to interpret baseline EKG, but no
   overt ST changes concerning for evolving infarct.
   # Clavicle fracture: Sling for comfort per ortho recs. Activity as
   tolerated. Pain control appropriate at this time
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Pt's plt count today is 47 from 51 which is lower
   than it has been in the past (usually plts are around 90-100). Pt may
   have a component of splenic sequestration, given known history of
   portal hypertension sequelae (varices, ascites) and splenomegaly on US.
   - Trend plt count (down slightly today)
   .
   # Mouth Pain
 patient with upper gum pain which for him occurs with
   some regularity probably likely due to denture malalignment.
   - Keep dentures out when possible per dental recs
   - Orabase PRN for mouth pain
   - Consider Peridex rinse if lesions develop (antimicrobial) per dental
   recs
   #ESRD. Plan for HD Tuesday, follow up renal recs.
   # FEN: prn IVF, replete electrolytes aggressively,  Renal Diet
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   # Disposition: Likely stay in ICU for now given low BPs, consider call
   out as his BPs are stable.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which can lead to organ damage, especially in the kidneys. The patient's baseline blood pressure is in the 70s, which may be a contributing factor.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and leukocytosis raise concern for sepsis. The patient's diarrhea and abdominal distension may be indicative of an underlying infection.
3. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which can contribute to weakness, confusion, and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and the patient is on hemodialysis. The patient's troponin levels are also elevated, which may indicate kidney damage.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's albumin levels are low, which may indicate malnutrition. This can contribute to weakness, fatigue, and poor wound healing.
7. Infection: The patient's diarrhea and abdominal distension may be indicative of an underlying infection. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection.
8. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's ammonia levels are low, which may indicate hepatic encephalopathy. However, the patient's examination does not suggest hepatic encephalopathy.
9. Amyloidosis: The patient's renal team is concerned about the possibility of amyloidosis, which can cause kidney damage and other systemic symptoms.
10. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, which may indicate cardiac damage. The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure.

To address these potential complications, the patient's medical team should:

1. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and provide fluid boluses as needed.
2. Perform a thorough infectious workup, including blood cultures and stool studies, to identify the underlying cause of the patient's diarrhea and abdominal distension.
3. Replete the patient's electrolytes aggressively to prevent further complications.
4. Consider a GI consult to evaluate the patient's diarrhea and abdominal distension.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
6. Provide nutritional support to the patient, including total parenteral nutrition if necessary.
7. Consider a liver function test to evaluate the patient's liver function and rule out hepatic encephalopathy.
8. Consider a GI consult to evaluate the patient's risk of amyloidosis.
9. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and consider cardiac enzymes and imaging studies if necessary.
10. Provide regular updates to the patient and their family regarding the patient's condition and treatment plan."
