   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several days
   out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -hold BB given hemodynamics
   -per surgery, will obtain CT chest w/o contrast to eval aortic ca+,
   carotid U/S, and U/A/Ucx
   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] re plan for CABG
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction. Given his very high SVR and severe MR,
   afterload reduction with IABP and nipride drip will likely be more
   effective, but will consider direct inotropy with dobutamine if cardiac
   index does not respond. He is also in heart failure with elevated
   filling pressures and will likely benefit from preload reduction with
   diuresis.
   -nipride drip, gently titrating to increase CI while keeping map>60,
   UOP and mentation.
   -gentle diuresis with lasix, monitoring CVP
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -TEE today
   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] re likely MVR/AVR
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia
   -no bb for now given cardiogenic shock
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs trending down this AM.
   -follow LFTs
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow cre.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.
   -holding home antihypertensives

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old Italian-speaking male who presents several days out from likely ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and has undergone cardiac catheterization showing 3-vessel disease with chronic right coronary artery (RCA) occlusion and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showing left ventricular dysfunction, 4+ mitral regurgitation, 3+ tricuspid regurgitation, and significant aortic stenosis. The patient has been placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.9°C (100.3°F)
* Heart rate: 98 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 115/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Central venous pressure (CVP): 15 mmHg
* Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP): 52/26 mmHg
* Cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI): 6.9 L/min and 4 L/min/m2, respectively

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb): 11.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 256 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.2 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 25 mEq/L
* Potassium (K+): 4.3 mEq/L
* Sodium (Na+): 136 mEq/L
* Glucose: 117 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Aspirin 325 mg
* Heparin drip
* Atorvastatin 80 mg
* No clopidogrel (Plavix) given due to planned surgery
* Hold beta-blocker (BB) given hemodynamics

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and sinus rhythm may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
2. Heart failure: The patient's left ventricular dysfunction and mitral regurgitation may worsen, leading to heart failure and pulmonary edema.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to renal failure and the need for dialysis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pneumonia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
5. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and other infections may worsen, leading to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's chronic liver disease and portal hypertension may worsen, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding and the need for transfusions.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) may worsen, leading to neurological complications such as paralysis, weakness, or cognitive impairment.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continue to titrate nipride drip to increase cardiac index while keeping mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60 mmHg, urine output, and mentation.
* Gentle diuresis with lasix, monitoring CVP.
* Follow I/Os, UOP, and mentation.
* Perform transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) today.
* Follow hemodynamics with Swan-Ganz catheter.
* Monitor for cardiac arrhythmias and adjust medications as needed.
* Monitor for signs of heart failure and adjust medications as needed.
* Monitor for signs of renal failure and adjust medications as needed.
* Monitor for signs of respiratory failure and adjust medications as needed.
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust antibiotics as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several days
   out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin once LFTs improved.
   -check methemoglobin after 2 days of nipride
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -start low dose BB and observe response
   -per surgery, will obtain CT chest w/o contrast to eval aortic ca+,
   carotid U/S, and U/A/Ucx
   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] re plan for CABG
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction. Given his very high SVR and severe MR,
   afterload reduction with IABP and nipride drip will likely be more
   effective, but will consider direct inotropy with dobutamine if cardiac
   index does not respond. He is also in heart failure with elevated
   filling pressures and will likely benefit from preload reduction with
   diuresis.
   -nipride drip, gently titrating to increase CI while keeping map>60,
   UOP and mentation.
   -gentle diuresis with lasix, monitoring CVP
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation

   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia

   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of

   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs trending down this AM.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several days
   out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin once LFTs improved.
   -check methemoglobin after 2 days of nipride
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -start low dose BB and observe response
   -per surgery, will obtain CT chest w/o contrast to eval aortic ca+,
   carotid U/S, and U/A/Ucx
   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] re plan for CABG
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction. Given his very high SVR and severe MR,
   afterload reduction with IABP and nipride drip will likely be more
   effective, but will consider direct inotropy with dobutamine if cardiac
   index does not respond. He is also in heart failure with elevated
   filling pressures and will likely benefit from preload reduction with
   diuresis.
   -nipride drip, gently titrating to increase CI while keeping map>60,
   UOP and mentation.
   -gentle diuresis with lasix, monitoring CVP
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -TEE today
   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] re likely MVR/AVR
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia
   -very low dose BB
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs trending down this AM.
   -follow LFTs
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several days
   out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin once LFTs improved.
   -check methemoglobin after 2 days of nipride
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -start low dose BB and observe response
   -per surgery, will obtain CT chest w/o contrast to eval aortic ca+,
   carotid U/S, and U/A/Ucx
   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] re plan for CABG
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction. Given his very high SVR and severe MR,
   afterload reduction with IABP and nipride drip will likely be more
   effective, but will consider direct inotropy with dobutamine if cardiac
   index does not respond. He is also in heart failure with elevated
   filling pressures and will likely benefit from preload reduction with
   diuresis.
   -nipride drip, gently titrating to increase CI while keeping map>60,
   UOP and mentation.
   -gentle diuresis with lasix, monitoring CVP
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -TEE today
   -f/u with CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] re likely MVR/AVR
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia
   -very low dose BB
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs trending down this AM.
   -follow LFTs
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow cre.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.
   -holding home antihypertensives

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old Italian-speaking male with a history of hypertension, who presented several days out from likely ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and has been diagnosed with 3-vessel disease (3VD) with chronic right coronary artery (RCA) occlusion and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. He has undergone cardiac catheterization and has been placed on an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 37.8°C, heart rate 98 bpm, blood pressure 120/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 95%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) 15 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) 48/28 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) 4.3 L/min, and cardiac index (CI) 2.5 L/min/m2.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count (WBC) 11.6 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin (Hb) 10.6 g/dL, platelet count (PLT) 188 x 10^9/L, and creatinine (Cr) 1.2 mg/dL.
* Respiratory support: Oxygen delivery device is a nasal cannula, and the patient is receiving 2 L/min of oxygen.
* Medications: Metoprolol, fentanyl, midazolam, and heparin sodium are being administered.
* Plan: The patient is scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with possible additional procedures, such as aortic valve replacement (AVR), mitral valve replacement (MVR), and/or tricuspid valve repair (TVR). He is being closely monitored for cardiac index, CVP, and urine output.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac tamponade: Due to the patient's 3VD and chronic RCA occlusion, there is a risk of cardiac tamponade, which can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL, which may indicate acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease. Further monitoring is necessary to determine the cause and progression of renal failure.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 95%. There is a risk of respiratory failure, particularly if his cardiac output decreases or if he develops pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
4. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin sodium, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as hematemesis, melena, or epistaxis.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly in the setting of his cardiac catheterization and IABP placement. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, tachycardia, and leukocytosis, is necessary.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.6 g/dL, which may indicate anemia. Further monitoring is necessary to determine the cause and progression of anemia.
7. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, which may indicate resolving shock liver. However, further monitoring is necessary to determine the cause and progression of transaminitis.
8. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 100s, which may indicate hypertension. Close monitoring is necessary to determine the cause and progression of hypertension.

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk of developing various medical complications, including cardiac tamponade, renal failure, respiratory failure, hemorrhagic complications, infection, anemia, transaminitis, and hypertension. Close monitoring and prompt treatment of any complications that arise are necessary to improve the patient's outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.  Addition of metoprolol dropped HR to 80s,
   which caused drop in CI and drop in mixed venous sat.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin 80 mg daily today.
   -morning methemaglobin 0, will recheck tomorrow AM.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   - cont BB
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip increased to 1.3mcg/kg/min, gently titrating to increase
   CI while keeping map>60, UOP and mentation.
   -some crackles on lung exam, morning CXR grossly unchanged.  Diuresis
   appears to be helping. 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] Lasix, goal neg 2 L
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation
   -cont  BB with goal HR 90-100 (appeared to decompensate when HR in
   80
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs continue to trend down.
   -follow LFTs
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.  Addition of metoprolol dropped HR to 80s,
   which caused drop in CI and drop in mixed venous sat.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin 80 mg daily today.
   -morning methemaglobin 0, will recheck tomorrow AM.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   - cont BB

   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip increased to 1.3mcg/kg/min, gently titrating to increase
   CI while keeping map>60, UOP and mentation.
   -some crackles on lung exam, morning CXR grossly unchanged.  Diuresis
   appears to be helping. 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] Lasix, goal neg 2 L
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation
   -cont  BB with goal HR 90-100 (appeared to decompensate when HR in
   80
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs continue to trend down.
   -follow LFTs
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented several days after a likely STEMI and was found to have 3VD with chronic RCA occlusion and LV dysfunction. He underwent catheterization and was placed on IABP for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction. The patient's condition has been complicated by cardiac index (CI) issues, with a drop in CI and mixed venous saturation when his heart rate was decreased. He is currently receiving metoprolol, nipride, and diuresis to manage his condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery, and his ABG results show a pH of 7.41, PCO2 of 47 mmHg, and PO2 of 82 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated troponin-T level, indicating myocardial damage. His kidney function is stable, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. His liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, indicating resolving shock liver.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's condition is complicated by cardiac index issues, which may lead to further cardiac complications, such as decreased cardiac output and increased risk of arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery, which may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation. Prolonged use of nasal cannula oxygen may lead to respiratory complications, such as nasal congestion and sinusitis.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's kidney function is stable, but the use of diuretics and IABP may lead to further kidney damage or acute kidney injury.
4. Liver Complications: The patient's LFTs are trending down, indicating resolving shock liver. However, further liver damage or acute liver failure may occur if the patient's condition continues to deteriorate.
5. Hematological Complications: The patient's platelet count is normal, but the use of IABP may lead to hemolysis and decreased platelet count.
6. Infection Complications: The patient is at risk for infection due to his immunocompromised state and the use of invasive devices, such as IABP and PA catheter.
7. Nutritional Complications: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and further nutritional deficiencies may occur if his condition continues to deteriorate.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several days
   out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.  Addition of metoprolol dropped HR to 80s,
   which caused drop in CI and drop in mixed venous sat.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin once LFTs improved.
   -morning methemaglobin 0, will recheck tomorrow AM.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -BB held because of worsening hemodynamics.
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.  Will discuss
   possibility of surgery tomorrow instead as patient
s status tenuous.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip increased to 1.3mcg/kg/min, gently titrating to increase
   CI while keeping map>60, UOP and mentation.
   -some crackles on lung exam, morning CXR grossly unchanged.  Diuresis
   appears to be helping.
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation
   -hold off on BB for now.
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs continue to trend down.
   -follow LFTs
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow cre.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.
   -holding home antihypertensives

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health status and potential medical complications:

**Current Status:**

* The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, who presented with likely STEMI and was found to have 3VD with chronic RCA occlusion and LV dysfunction.
* He has been s/p IABP placement and is planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
* His current vital signs are:
	+ Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
	+ Heart rate: 98 bpm (90-110)
	+ Blood pressure: 120/70 mmHg (96/52-137/74 mmHg)
	+ Respiratory rate: 26 breaths/min (12-29)
	+ SpO2: 95%
* His laboratory results show:
	+ Hemoglobin: 10.6 g/dL
	+ White blood cell count: 11.6 K/uL
	+ Platelet count: 188 K/uL
	+ Troponin-T: 4.12 ng/mL
	+ Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
	+ Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* He is receiving the following medications:
	+ Metoprolol: 12.5 mg every 12 hours
	+ Fentanyl: 1.3 mcg/kg/min
	+ Midazolam (Versed): 1.3 mcg/kg/min
	+ Furosemide (Lasix): 20 mg IV every 12 hours
	+ Heparin sodium: 1,150 units/hour
	+ Nitroprusside: 1.3 mcg/kg/min
	+ Nipride: 1.3 mcg/kg/min

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Complications:**
	* Myocardial infarction (MI) due to the patient's history of STEMI and ongoing cardiac dysfunction.
	* Cardiogenic shock due to the patient's low cardiac index and high systemic vascular resistance.
	* Arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, due to the patient's tachycardia and cardiac dysfunction.
2. **Renal Complications:**
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to the patient's history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and cardiogenic shock.
	* Chronic kidney disease progression due to the patient's underlying kidney disease and potential nephrotoxicity from medications.
3. **Respiratory Complications:**
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the patient's history of cardiogenic shock and potential lung edema.
	* Pneumonia due to the patient's history of IABP placement and potential bacterial colonization of the device.
4. **Infectious Complications:**
	* Sepsis due to the patient's history of IABP placement and potential bacterial colonization of the device.
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's history of mechanical ventilation.
5. **Gastrointestinal Complications:**
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's history of cardiogenic shock and potential gastrointestinal mucosal injury.
	* Stress ulceration due to the patient's history of cardiogenic shock and potential gastrointestinal mucosal injury.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and hemodynamics closely.
2. Consider increasing the dose of metoprolol to improve cardiac function.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and adjust medications as necessary to prevent AKI.
4. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's regimen to prevent sepsis and VAP.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal function closely and consider adding acid suppression therapy to prevent stress ulceration.
6. Consider consulting with a cardiologist and intensivist to optimize the patient's care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several days
   out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.  Addition of metoprolol dropped HR to 80s,
   which caused drop in CI and drop in mixed venous sat.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin once LFTs improved.
   -morning methemaglobin 0, will recheck tomorrow AM.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -BB held because of worsening hemodynamics.
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.  Will discuss
   possibility of surgery tomorrow instead as patient
s status tenuous.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip increased to 1.3mcg/kg/min, gently titrating to increase
   CI while keeping map>60, UOP and mentation.
   -some crackles on lung exam, morning CXR grossly unchanged.  Diuresis
   appears to be helping.
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation
   -hold off on BB for now.
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - send hemolysis labs
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs continue to trend down.
   -follow LFTs
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow cre.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.
   -holding home antihypertensives

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who presents with a history of hypertension and likely ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). He has been in the ICU for several days and has undergone cardiac catheterization, which showed 3-vessel disease with chronic RCA occlusion and left ventricular dysfunction. He has also undergone transesophageal echocardiography and ultrasound of the carotid arteries.

The patient is currently receiving treatment for cardiogenic shock, including inotropes, afterload reduction, and diuresis. He is also receiving anticoagulation therapy and has had an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placed. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 98 bpm and a blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg.

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, and his creatinine level is stable. He also has a history of anemia, which is likely related to hemolysis in the setting of IABP. His liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, indicating possible resolving shock liver.

The patient is scheduled for cardiac surgery, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), mitral valve repair or replacement (MVR), and aortic valve replacement (AVR). His condition is considered tenuous, and his cardiologist is considering the possibility of surgery tomorrow instead of Monday.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiogenic shock and LV dysfunction make him at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and cardiac tamponade.
2. Renal complications: The patient's chronic kidney disease and possible acute kidney injury (AKI) increase his risk for further renal complications, such as AKI, chronic kidney disease progression, and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hematological complications: The patient's anemia and possible hemolysis in the setting of IABP increase his risk for further hematological complications, such as bleeding, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's cardiogenic shock and possible pulmonary edema increase his risk for further respiratory complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, and pneumonia.
5. Infectious complications: The patient's IABP and possible central venous catheter increase his risk for further infectious complications, such as bloodstream infections, sepsis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Neurological complications: The patient's cardiogenic shock and possible hypotension increase his risk for further neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, and encephalopathy.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.  Addition of metoprolol dropped HR to 80s,
   which caused drop in CI and drop in mixed venous sat.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, start atorvastatin 80 mg daily today.
   -morning methemaglobin 0, will recheck tomorrow AM.
   -no plavix given likely surgery

   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip increased to 1.3mcg/kg/min, gently titrating to increase
   CI while keeping map>60, UOP and mentation.
   -some crackles on lung exam, morning CXR grossly unchanged.  Diuresis
   appears to be helping. 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] Lasix, goal neg 2 L

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, who presented with likely ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) several days prior to admission. He has been treated with IABP placement, metoprolol, and nicardipine to manage his cardiac condition. His current vital signs include a heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 120/70 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His cardiac index is low, and he is being managed with diuresis, IABP, and nicardipine to reduce afterload and increase cardiac output. He is also being monitored for potential complications such as anemia, transaminitis, and renal failure.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Continued low cardiac index may indicate ongoing myocardial dysfunction, which could worsen if not addressed.
	* The patient's tachycardia may be necessary for compensation, but it may also increase the risk of arrhythmias and cardiac instability.
	* The patient's cardiac function may be further compromised by chronic RCA occlusion and LV dysfunction.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* The patient's oxygen saturation is stable, but he has been complaining of sleeping poorly and residual chest discomfort, which may indicate ongoing respiratory issues.
	* The patient's lung exam shows some crackles, which may indicate pulmonary edema or atelectasis.
3. Renal complications:
	* The patient's creatinine level is stable, but his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is high, which may indicate ongoing kidney dysfunction.
	* The patient's urine output is being monitored, but his fluid balance is still positive, which may indicate ongoing fluid overload.
4. Neurological complications:
	* The patient is alert and oriented, but his mental status may be compromised by his underlying cardiac condition and potential electrolyte imbalances.
	* The patient's neurological status should be closely monitored for signs of worsening cardiac function or potential complications such as stroke or seizures.
5. Hematological complications:
	* The patient's hemoglobin level is dropping, which may indicate ongoing hemolysis in the setting of IABP placement.
	* The patient's platelet count should be closely monitored for signs of thrombocytopenia.
6. Infectious complications:
	* The patient is at risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to his prolonged mechanical ventilation.
	* The patient should be monitored for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, or changes in mental status.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min.
   -new systolic murmur likely due to improvement in MR, signaling that
   diuresis is helping.
   -aggressive diuresis yesterday appears to have improved CI.  Continues
   to have crackles on lung exam, goal today gentle diuresis with standing
   2x40mg IV Lasix
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation,
   though he is able to handle HR in high 80s.
   -cont  BB with goal HR 80-100.
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - Elevated LDH and normal TBili, Hct has been steady for 48 hours, does
   not appear to have ongoing hemolysis.
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs nearly normalized.
   -follow LFTs every few days.
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow cre.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male who presents with a history of hypertension and likely STEMI, s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR, and significant AS. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for cardiac management and is planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.7°C, Tcurrent 37.2°C, HR 88 bpm, BP 98/60 mmHg, RR 19 inspirations per minute, SpO2 95%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 12 mmHg, PAP (43/23) mmHg, CO/CI (4.7 L/min)/ (2.7 L/min/m2), Mixed Venous O2% Sat 59-63.
* Fluid balance: Total In 2,660 mL, PO 1,020 mL, TF 1,640 mL, IVF 1,640 mL, Blood products 5,000 mL, Urine 5,000 mL, NG 1,020 mL, Stool 1,020 mL, Drains 1,020 mL, Balance -2,340 mL.
* Respiratory support: O2 delivery device nasal cannula, SpO2 95%, ABG //32/.
* Physical examination: General appearance no acute distress, eyes/conjunctiva PERRL, cardiovascular (S1: normal), (S2: normal), III/VI systolic murmur, peripheral vascular (right radial pulse: present), (left radial pulse: present), (right DP pulse: diminished), (left DP pulse: diminished), respiratory/chest bilateral crackles at bases, abdominal soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present, extremities warm and well-perfused, IABP access site clean, dry, and intact, neurologic alert and oriented x3.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 11.6, Hct 36.2, Plt 98,000.
* Electrolytes: Na 136, K 3.8, Cl 97, Ca++ 8.5, Mg++ 1.9, PO4 3.2.
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 22 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) 1.2 mg/dL, troponin-T 4.12 ng/mL.
* Lactic acid 1.0 mmol/L, albumin 3.4 g/dL, LDH 525 IU/L.

The patient's medications are as follows:

* ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily, nipride gtt 1.3 mcg/kg/min, Lasix 40 mg IV x2.
* Prophylaxis: DVT on heparin, stress ulcer on H2 blocker.

The patient's plan is as follows:

* Continue diuresis with goal of -2 L.
* Monitor I/Os, UOP, and mentation.
* Monitor hemodynamics with Swan.
* Continue BB with goal HR 80-100.
* Monitor on tele.
* Follow LFTs every few days.
* Continue to follow cre.
* Continue to hold home antihypertensives.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: further deterioration of LV function, worsening of MR, TR, and AS, and development of cardiac arrhythmias.
* Respiratory complications: further deterioration of pulmonary edema, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and need for mechanical ventilation.
* Renal complications: worsening of acute kidney injury, development of chronic kidney disease, and need for dialysis.
* Hematological complications: worsening of anemia, development of bleeding diathesis, and need for blood transfusions.
* Infections: development of sepsis, septic shock, and need for antibiotic therapy.
* Gastrointestinal complications: development of gastrointestinal bleeding, bowel obstruction, and need for surgical intervention.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min.
   -new systolic murmur likely due to improvement in MR, signaling that
   diuresis is helping.
   -aggressive diuresis yesterday appears to have improved CI.  Continues
   to have crackles on lung exam, goal today gentle diuresis with standing
   2x40mg IV Lasix.
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation,
   though he is able to handle HR in high 80s.
   -cont  BB with goal HR 80-100.
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - Elevated LDH and normal TBili, Hct has been steady for 48 hours, does
   not appear to have ongoing hemolysis.
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs nearly normalized.
   -follow LFTs every few days.
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow cre.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.
   -holding home antihypertensives

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presents with suspected STEMI, 3VD, and chronic RCA occlusion. He has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone catheterization, IABP placement, and planning for possible CABG, MVR, AVR, and TVR. The patient's condition has been complicated by pulmonary edema, which has worsened since the previous day, and he has been treated with Lasix and diuresis. His cardiac index is low, and he has a systolic murmur, which is likely due to improvement in MR. His anemia is likely related to hemolysis in the setting of IABP, and his transaminitis is likely resolving shock liver in the setting of cardiogenic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema has worsened since the previous day, and he is at risk for further deterioration if not properly managed.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac index is low, and he has a systolic murmur, which may indicate ongoing cardiac failure.
3. Hemolysis: The patient's anemia is likely related to hemolysis in the setting of IABP, and he is at risk for further hemolysis if not properly monitored.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is stable, but he is at risk for further deterioration if not properly managed.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his prolonged stay in the ICU and his compromised immune system.
6. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to his anticoagulation therapy and his IABP placement.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and low cardiac index may put him at risk for respiratory failure.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's systolic murmur and low cardiac index may indicate ongoing cardiovascular instability, which may require further management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to closely monitor the patient's pulmonary edema and adjust his diuretic therapy as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac index and adjust his inotropic therapy as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's anemia and hemolysis, and adjust his IABP therapy as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his fluid management as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and adjust his antibiotic therapy as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient for signs of bleeding and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his oxygen therapy as necessary.
8. Continue to closely monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust his therapy as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min.
   -new systolic murmur likely due to improvement in MR, signaling that
   diuresis is helping.
   -aggressive diuresis yesterday appears to have improved CI.  Continues
   to have crackles on lung exam, goal today gentle diuresis with standing
   2x40mg IV Lasix
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation,
   though he is able to handle HR in high 80s.
   -cont  BB with goal HR 80-100.
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32, likely related to hemolysis in setting of
   IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - Elevated LDH and normal TBili, Hct has been steady for 48 hours, does
   not appear to have ongoing hemolysis.
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs nearly normalized.
   -follow LFTs every few days.
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cre from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow cre.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension, who presented with a likely STEMI several days ago. He underwent catheterization showing 3VD with chronic RCA occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR, and significant AS. He has been treated with IABP placement, ASA, heparin, and atorvastatin. His current condition is complicated by pulmonary edema, which has worsened since the previous day, and he is being treated with diuresis and IABP. He has also developed a systolic murmur, which is likely due to improvement in MR.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema has worsened since the previous day, and he is at risk of further deterioration. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and fluid balance is essential.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status is complex, with 3VD, chronic RCA occlusion, and significant AS. He is at risk of further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable, but he is at risk of further deterioration due to his underlying cardiac and renal disease.
4. Hemolytic Anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped from 36 to 32, likely due to hemolysis in the setting of IABP. Close monitoring of his platelet count and hemoglobin levels is essential.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's LFTs have nearly normalized, but he is at risk of further liver damage due to his underlying cardiogenic shock.
6. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to his prolonged hospitalization and underlying medical conditions.
7. DVT: The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to his immobility and underlying cardiac disease. Close monitoring of his DVT prophylaxis is essential.
8. VAP: The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to his prolonged mechanical ventilation and underlying respiratory disease. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and VAP prophylaxis is essential.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension who presented with suspected STEMI and was found to have 3VD with chronic RCA occlusion and LV dysfunction. He has undergone IABP placement and is being planned for CABG, MVR, AVR, and TVR surgery on Monday morning. His current condition is characterized by pulmonary edema, which has worsened since yesterday, and he is receiving diuretic therapy to reduce afterload and improve cardiac index. He has also been started on atorvastatin and is being monitored for anemia, transaminitis, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema has worsened since yesterday, which may lead to respiratory distress and decreased oxygen saturation.
2. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's IABP placement may cause cardiac tamponade, which can lead to cardiac arrest and decreased cardiac output.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen due to the use of diuretic therapy, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and decreased cardiac output.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to the use of IABP, which can cause hemolysis and decreased cardiac output.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may worsen due to the use of diuretic therapy, which can lead to liver damage and decreased cardiac output.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen due to the use of diuretic therapy, which can lead to increased cardiac output and decreased blood pressure.
7. Infection: The patient's IABP placement may increase the risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and decreased cardiac output.
8. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant therapy may increase the risk of bleeding, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and increased mortality.

These potential complications highlight the importance of close monitoring and management of the patient's condition to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min. Serum thiocyanate level ordered
 sent to outside lab [**2184-7-31**]
   -new systolic murmur likely due to improvement in MR, signaling that
   diuresis is helping.

   to have crackles on lung exam, goal today gentle diuresis with standing
   2x40mg IV Lasix
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation,
   though he is able to handle HR in high 80s.
   -cont  BB with goal HR 80-100.
   -monitor on tele
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 3200> 33.3, likely related to hemolysis in
   setting of IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - Elevated LDH and normal TBili, Hct has been steady for 48 hours, does
   not appear to have ongoing hemolysis.
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs nearly normalized.
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cr from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old Italian-speaking male with a history of hypertension who presents several days after likely STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) with chronic RCA (right coronary artery) occlusion and TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) showing LV (left ventricular) dysfunction, 4+MR (mitral regurgitation), 3+TR (tricuspid regurgitation), and significant AS (aortic stenosis). He has been placed on IABP (intra-aortic balloon pump) for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure of 115/58 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His respiratory rate is 27 breaths per minute, and his temperature is 37.2°C (99°F).

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 12.2 K/μL, hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 186 K/μL. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 30 mEq/L, and his creatinine is 1.2 mg/dL. His troponin-T is 4.12 ng/mL, and his cardiac enzymes are elevated.

The patient's physical examination reveals a systolic murmur at the apex, mild bilateral crackles at the bases of the lungs, and diminished peripheral pulses. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, and his extremities are warm and well-perfused.

The patient's cardiac index is low, and his cardiac output is decreased. He is tachycardic, with a heart rate in the high 80s. His blood pressure is in the 100s, and his cardiac index is increased with afterload reduction.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of STEMI and LV dysfunction, he is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation.
2. Heart failure: The patient's LV dysfunction and chronic RCA occlusion put him at risk for heart failure, which can worsen his symptoms and increase his mortality.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and elevated creatinine levels put him at risk for acute kidney injury, which can worsen his renal function and increase his mortality.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory disease and elevated blood pressure put him at risk for respiratory failure, which can worsen his symptoms and increase his mortality.
5. Sepsis: The patient's history of STEMI and LV dysfunction put him at risk for sepsis, which can worsen his symptoms and increase his mortality.

In conclusion, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension and STEMI who presents with LV dysfunction, chronic RCA occlusion, and significant AS. He has been placed on IABP for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction. His vital signs are stable, but he is at risk for various medical complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, renal failure, respiratory failure, and sepsis."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min. Serum thiocyanate level ordered
 sent to outside lab [**2184-7-31**]
   -new systolic murmur likely due to improvement in MR, signaling that
   diuresis is helping.
   -aggressive diuresis yesterday appears to have improved CI.  Continues
   to have crackles on lung exam, goal today gentle diuresis with standing
   2x40mg IV Lasix
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation. Goal negative 1 L today.
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation,
   though he is able to handle HR in high 80s.
   -cont  BB with goal HR 80-100.
   -monitor on tele
   Leukocytosis:
   -WBC slightly increased today but no other signs of infection. Will add
   on differential to AM labs.
   -Nothing to suggest IABP infection, hemodynamics remain stable
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32> 33.3, likely related to hemolysis in setting
   of IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - Elevated LDH and normal TBili, Hct has been steady for 48 hours, does
   not appear to have ongoing hemolysis.
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs nearly normalized.
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cr from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow creatinine.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.
   -holding home antihypertensives

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old Italian-speaking male who presents several days out from likely STEMI (ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction). He has undergone catheterization showing 3VD (three-vessel disease) with chronic RCA (right coronary artery) occlusion and TTE (transesophageal echocardiogram) showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR (severe mitral regurgitation), 3+TR (severe tricuspid regurgitation), and significant AS (aortic stenosis). He has been placed on IABP (intra-aortic balloon pump) for increased coronary perfusion and afterload reduction.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 115/58 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 27 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula. His physical examination reveals a mild bilateral crackle at the bases of the lungs and a systolic murmur at the apex.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.6, hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 186,000/μL. His creatinine is 1.2 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen is 30 mg/dL. His troponin-T is 4.12 ng/mL, and his CK-MB is 9 ng/mL.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, and he has been taking ASA (aspirin) 325 mg daily, heparin gtt (continuous infusion), and atorvastatin 80 mg daily. He is planned for CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting) and possibly AVR (aortic valve replacement), MVR (mitral valve replacement), and TVR (tricuspid valve replacement) on Monday morning.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has significant cardiac disease, including 3VD, chronic RCA occlusion, and LV dysfunction. He is at risk for cardiac complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, and cardiogenic shock.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient has mild bilateral crackles at the bases of the lungs, which may indicate pulmonary edema or congestion. He is at risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications: The patient has acute kidney injury, and his creatinine is 1.2 mg/dL. He is at risk for further renal deterioration and may require dialysis.
4. Infection: The patient has been placed on IABP, which carries a risk of infection. He is also at risk for other infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis.
5. Hematological complications: The patient has leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia, which may indicate infection or bleeding. He is at risk for further hematological complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and bleeding.
6. Neurological complications: The patient has been sedated and is at risk for neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, and brain death.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has been on cardiac diet and may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

In summary, the patient is a high-risk individual who requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min. Serum thiocyanate level ordered
 sent to outside lab [**2184-7-31**]
   -new systolic murmur likely due to improvement in MR, signaling that
   diuresis is helping.
   -aggressive diuresis yesterday appears to have improved CI.  Continues
   to have crackles on lung exam, goal today gentle diuresis with standing
   2x40mg IV Lasix
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation. Goal negative 1 L today.
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation,
   though he is able to handle HR in high 80s.
   -cont  BB with goal HR 80-100.
   -monitor on tele
   Leukocytosis:
   -WBC slightly increased today but no other signs of infection. Will add
   on differential to AM labs.
   -Nothing to suggest IABP infection, hemodynamics remain stable
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32> 33.3, likely related to hemolysis in setting
   of IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - Elevated LDH and normal TBili, Hct has been steady for 48 hours, does
   not appear to have ongoing hemolysis.
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs nearly normalized.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 65 yo Italian-speaking male with HTN who presents several
   days out from likely STEMI now s/p cath showing 3VD with chronic RCA
   occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR and significant
   AS, s/p IABP placement and planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.
   CORONARIES: Severe LM/3VD s/p probable inferior STEMI, planning for
   likely CABG. IABP placed for increased coronary perfusion and afterload
   reduction; will likely leave IABP for several days to facilitate
   recovery of the myocardium.
   -ASA 325, heparin gtt, atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
   -no plavix given likely surgery
   -CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] planning CABG/MVR/AVR for Monday morning.
   PUMP: 4+MR, 3+TR, mild/mod AS. He is tachycardic with SBPs in 100s but
   with low cardiac index. Cardiac index could be increased by either
   inotropy or afterload reduction.  Currently focusing on afterload
   reduction with diuresis, IABP and nipride gtt.
   -nipride drip steady at 1.3mcg/kg/min. Serum thiocyanate level ordered
 sent to outside lab [**2184-7-31**]
   -new systolic murmur likely due to improvement in MR, signaling that
   diuresis is helping.
   -aggressive diuresis yesterday appears to have improved CI.  Continues
   to have crackles on lung exam, goal today gentle diuresis with standing
   2x40mg IV Lasix
   -follow I/Os, UOP and mentation. Goal negative 1 L today.
   -follow hemodynamics with Swan
   RHYTHM: Sinus tachycardia appears to be necessary for compensation,
   though he is able to handle HR in high 80s.
   -cont  BB with goal HR 80-100.
   -monitor on tele
   Leukocytosis:
   -WBC slightly increased today but no other signs of infection. Will add
   on differential to AM labs.
   -Nothing to suggest IABP infection, hemodynamics remain stable
   Anemia: Hct drop 36 -> 32> 33.3, likely related to hemolysis in setting
   of IABP. Continue to trend, and follow platelet count.
   - Elevated LDH and normal TBili, Hct has been steady for 48 hours, does
   not appear to have ongoing hemolysis.
   Transaminitis: Likely resolving shock liver in setting of cardiogenic
   shock given LFTs nearly normalized.
   Renal failure: Acute vs Chronic. Last known cr from [**2181**] was 0.9.
   therefore, likely chronic. Cre stable from yesterday.
   - Continue to follow creatinine.
   HTN: SBPs in 100s since arrival to floor.
   -holding home antihypertensives
   ICU Care
   FEN: Cardiac diet
   Replete IVF/lytes PRN

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

Patient Summary:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with likely STEMI several days ago and has undergone cardiac catheterization showing 3VD with chronic RCA occlusion and TTE showing LV dysfunction, 4+MR, 3+TR, and significant AS. He has been treated with IABP placement and is planning for probable CABG +/- AVR/MVR/TVR.

Current Condition:

The patient is hemodynamically stable with maps and pads unchanged, and his IABP is functioning well. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 115/58 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He has mild bilateral crackles at the bases of his lungs and a diminished radial pulse on both sides. His laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, anemia, and transaminitis, which are likely related to his underlying cardiac condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is complex, and he is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's lung exam shows mild bilateral crackles, which may indicate early signs of pulmonary edema or respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is stable, but he has chronic kidney disease, which may worsen with further cardiac complications or fluid overload.
4. Neurological complications: The patient is at risk for neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures, due to his cardiac condition and potential for further cardiac complications.
5. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, which may indicate infection. However, his temperature is normal, and there are no other signs of infection.
6. Hemolysis: The patient's platelet count is normal, but his hemoglobin level has decreased, which may indicate hemolysis due to his IABP.
7. Shock liver: The patient's liver function tests are nearly normalized, but he has a history of shock liver, which may worsen with further cardiac complications.

Plan:

The patient's plan is to continue diuresis while awaiting surgery tomorrow. His IABP and nipride drip will be continued, and he will receive gentle diuresis with standing 2x40mg IV Lasix. His hemodynamics will be closely monitored, and his white blood cell count will be followed to rule out infection."
