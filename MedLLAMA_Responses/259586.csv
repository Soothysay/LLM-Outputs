   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo F w/ severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary
   edema.
   #.  Hypoxia:
   94% on 15L NRB, but not tachypnic, speaking in full sentences. CXR/lung
   exam consistent with pulmonary edema. Cr has been rising with mild
   diuresis c/w diastolic dysfunction seen on recent ECHO. Pt. has been
   very fluid positive for length of stay. Would also consider PE given
   rapid onset of hypoxia if does not improve w/ diuresis but has not been
   hypotense or more tachycardic.
   - Lasix drip titrate to >100cc/hr
   - consider repeat ECHO if difficulty diuresing
   - strict I/O
   - daily weights
   - Now OK to intubate if necessary
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Baseline Cr 1-1.3, Most likely [**1-4**] diuresis in the setting of diastolic
   dysfunction. Urine sediment bland, no muddy brown casts.
   - Will continue to diurese given pulmonary edema and large O2
   requirement.
   - Renal U/S to r/o obstruction
   - renally dose all meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   #.  Malnutrition:
   Has been unable to swallow [**1-4**] dysmotility, possibly secondary to
   previous radiation. Contributing to her hypoxia.
   - will d/w primary onc team whether to put in doboff after her
   oxygenation is more stable as not a candidate for G-tube currently.
   - Question PICC and initiation of TPN if patient not going to be a
   candidate for dobhoff due to her poor respiratory status
   - Nutrition consult for tube feeding or TPN recs pending route of
   nutrition
   #. Anemia:
   Appears to be anemia of chronic disease from iron studies on [**2168-10-19**]
   with increased ferritin, essentially preserved iron to TIBC ratio. HCT
   stable since [**2168-10-16**].
   - Trend HCT
   #. Thrombocytopenia:
   HIT antibody negative, likely related to poor nutritional status.
   - Trend thromboyctopenia
   #. BCL:
   Has been in remission but LDH rising.
   - f/u onc recs
   #.  Hypothyroid:
   - Continue levothyroxine IV
   #Cutaneous cadidiasis:
   Intertriginal erythema
   - Continue miconazole powder
   #  Hypertension:
   Controlled at this time, though was a bit borderline with systolics in
   the 100s and would benefit from drifting up a bit while diuresing.
   - Hold diltiazem while actively diuresing
   #.  Atrial fibrillation
   - Diltiazem for rate control as blood pressure allows

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary edema. The patient has been experiencing hypoxia, and her Cr has been rising with mild diuresis, indicating diastolic dysfunction. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via a medium-concentration mask, with an SpO2 of 100%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals a pleasant and well-appearing individual with diffuse 4+ pitting edema, peripheral pulses palpable, and no rashes or lesions. The patient's neurological examination shows A&Ox3, but distractable. 

The patient's lab results indicate a WBC count of 11.8, Hct of 28.4, and a Cr of 1.7 mg/dL. The patient's glucose level is 143 mg/dL, and her Ca++ and Mg++ levels are within normal range. 

The patient's medical conditions include hypoxia, malnutrition, anemia, thrombocytopenia, BCL, hypothyroidism, cutaneous candidiasis, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. 

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Pulmonary edema exacerbation: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and her pulmonary edema is not fully reversed. Further diuresis may be necessary to improve her oxygenation.
2. Renal dysfunction: The patient's Cr level is rising, indicating potential worsening of her renal insufficiency. Close monitoring of her renal function and fluid balance is essential.
3. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition is severe, and her hypoxia may be exacerbated by her inability to swallow. Further evaluation and treatment of her malnutrition are necessary.
4. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may be related to her malnutrition and chronic disease. Close monitoring of her hemoglobin and platelet count is essential.
5. BCL: The patient's BCL is in remission, but her LDH level is rising. Further evaluation and treatment of her BCL are necessary.
6. Cutaneous candidiasis: The patient's intertriginal erythema may be a sign of cutaneous candidiasis. Further evaluation and treatment of this condition are necessary.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is well-controlled, but close monitoring of her thyroid function is essential.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is controlled, but close monitoring of her blood pressure is essential to prevent further exacerbation of her condition.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and potential complications. Close monitoring of her respiratory, renal, and nutritional status is essential to prevent further exacerbation of her condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo F w/ severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary
   edema.
   #.  Hypoxia:
   The patient is currently 100% on medium concentration mask, but not
   tachypnic, speaking in full sentences. Differential is broad and
   includes pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction and low
   oncoltic pressures secondary to malnutrition.  Alternatively,
   infectious causes such as influenza or PNA could be considered.
   Finally, pulmonary embolism could present with hypoxia, although
   radiographic presence of bilateral infiltrates on CXR, with chest pain,
   hypotension or tachycardia make it less likely.   CXR/lung exam is
   consistent with pulmonary edema, however IJ is not distended.   Cr has
   been rising with mild diuresis c/w diastolic dysfunction seen on recent
   ECHO. Pt. has been very fluid positive for length of stay. Given a
   combination of nausea in a patient with known distolic dysfunction,
   will rule out for MI.
   - Continue aggressive duresis with Lasix and monitor response
   -Will start empiric coverage for HCAP, PCP if no improvement in
   oxygenation following aggressive duresis over the next several hours
   -Influenza swab, Tamiflu, Droplet precautions
   -F/u urine Legionella Ag
   -Obtain induced sputum Cx if possible

   dysfunction. Urine sediment bland, no muddy brown casts.   Urine lytes
   c/w prerenal cause, poor forward flow vs. hypovolemia.  Renal U/S shows
   no e/o obstruction.
   - Will continue to diurese at this point and monitor for response.  If
   no clinical improvement, may need to re-address.
   -Trend Cr, UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   #.  Malnutrition:
   Has been unable to swallow [**1-4**] dysmotility, possibly secondary to
   previous radiation. Contributing to her hypoxia.
   - NPO for now in the setting of respiratory distress.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PICC and initiation of TPN if patient not going to be a
   candidate for dobhoff due to her poor respiratory status
   #. Anemia:
   Appears to be anemia of chronic disease from iron studies on [**2168-10-19**]
   with increased ferritin, essentially preserved iron to TIBC ratio.
   Given macrocytic, may be a contribution from hypothyrodism.   HCT

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -Renal U/S was performed and preliminary read indicates no
   hydronephrosis. Doppler evaluation extremely limited given patient
   inability to breath hold. Resistive indices around 0.8 in both kidneys,
   which is slightly elevated, but given limited exam, may be unreliable.
   -The patient was not able to receive Zaroxylin as as she was noted to
   be coughing on a swab, very high risk of aspiration.  She continued on
   Lasix infusion at the rate of 20, but became hypotensive and rate had
   to be lowered to 10.
   This AM, the patient is unable to state whether her breathing has
   improved.  She reports pain in her back and R side [**7-11**] in intensity.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 82-year-old female who is currently in the ICU with severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary edema. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/44 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via a medium concentration mask and has a SpO2 of 100%.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral crackles to the apices, and the patient has diffuse 4+ pitting edema on the left side. The patient's skin is intact, with no rashes or lesions. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and rising creatinine levels.

The patient's medical history includes a history of radiation therapy, which may have contributed to her dysmotility and malnutrition. The patient is also taking medications for hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's diagnosis is broad, including pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction and low oncotic pressures secondary to malnutrition. The patient is also at risk for infectious causes such as influenza or PNA, and pulmonary embolism.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue aggressive diuresis with Lasix and monitor response.
2. Start empiric coverage for HCAP, PCP if no improvement in oxygenation following aggressive diuresis over the next several hours.
3. Influenza swab, Tamiflu, and droplet precautions.
4. Obtain induced sputum Cx if possible.
5. Repeat TTE.
6. EKG, cycle CEs.
7. Strict I/O.
8. Daily weights.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is at risk for hypoxia due to her pulmonary edema and malnutrition.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to her immunocompromised state and respiratory distress.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk for pulmonary embolism due to her immobility and respiratory distress.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient is at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis due to her diabetes and malnutrition.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient is at risk for hypothyroidism due to her hypothyroidism and malnutrition.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient is at risk for thrombocytopenia due to her thrombocytopenia and malnutrition.
7. Anemia: The patient is at risk for anemia due to her anemia and malnutrition.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill 82-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.9°C (96.6°F)
* Heart rate: 101 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 100/44 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient has a history of respiratory failure, and the differential diagnosis includes:

* Congestive heart failure (CHF)
* Infection (influenza, bacterial pneumonia, and PCP)
* Acute renal failure
* Malnutrition
* Hypernatremia
* Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs)
* Thrombocytopenia

The patient is receiving various medications, including:

* Lasix (furosemide) for diuresis
* Heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Famotidine (Pepcid) for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Zofran (ondansetron) for nausea and vomiting
* Hydrocortisone cream for skin care

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Respiratory: bilateral crackles in the lungs
* Cardiovascular: normal heart sounds
* Abdominal: soft and non-tender
* Extremities: right and left lower extremity edema
* Skin: warm
* Neurologic: responds to verbal stimuli, has purposeful movement, and normal tone

The patient's laboratory results are:

* Hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 11.8 K/uL
* Platelet count: 97 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 143 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.8 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show bilateral symmetric infiltrates on the chest radiograph (CXR), which are worse than prior studies.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: worsening of respiratory distress, need for mechanical ventilation
* Infection: progression of pneumonia, development of sepsis
* Acute renal failure: worsening of kidney function, need for dialysis
* Malnutrition: worsening of nutritional status, increased risk of complications
* Hypernatremia: worsening of electrolyte imbalance, potential for seizures or cardiac arrhythmias
* Abnormal LFTs: progression of liver dysfunction, potential for liver failure
* Thrombocytopenia: worsening of bleeding risk, potential for hemorrhage

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Respiratory support: oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation if needed
* Cardiovascular support: diuresis with Lasix, monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate
* Infection prevention: droplet precautions, antibiotic therapy for suspected infections
* Renal support: monitoring of kidney function, potential for dialysis
* Nutritional support: enteric feeding or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) if needed
* Hypernatremia management: repletion of free water if necessary
* Abnormal LFTs management: monitoring of liver function, potential for liver transplantation if necessary
* Thrombocytopenia management: monitoring of platelet count, potential for platelet transfusions if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo F w/ severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary
   edema, now intubated and sedated.
   #.  Respiratory Failure/Hypoxia:
   Had episode of desat on NRB, not responsive to Lasix and was
   intubated.  Continues to have a broad differential diagnosis.  Has
   negative swab for influenza, and chest xray and physical exam most
   consistent with pulmonary edema, possible secondary to diastolic
   dysfunction.  She has low oncotic pressures secondary to malnutrition.
   Also started empiric pneumonia and PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 10187**] yesterday in setting of
   lack of clinical improvement.  Likely has worsening volume overload and
   acute renal failure making diuresis difficult.  Differential diagnosis
   at this point includes infectious pneumonia, bacterial or viral, PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 10190**] heart failure, third spacing due to malnutrition into lungs,
   diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.  Also consider Wegener
s or Goodpasture
   in setting of concurrent renal failure.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - Stopped metolazone in the morning as cannot take PO
   - was on lasix gtt @ 20mg/hr and had very low urine output by 2pm,
   ended up completing stopping Lasix gtt
   - started on Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for HAP and Bactrim IV for PCP tx
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] RT got swab for viral antigen screen/cultures
   - Gave 1L D5W for hypernatremia
   - Flu swab negative, legionella antigen pending, dc'ed respiratory
   precautions and Tamiflu
   - Renal team saw patient, recommended continued diuresis
   - Didn't get [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] hopefully get tomorrow
   - Had increasing respiratory distress after lasix gtt stopped and
   getting fluids, got ABG (7.33/36/184/20/-6) and CXR looked relatively
   stable with an increase in interstitial.  She clinically improved
   without intervention.
   - Placed on face mask at 15L due to pO2 of 184, tolerated well for a
   few hours, then placed back on NRB.
   - Desatted on NRB with increasing respiratory distress, gas showed

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary edema. She was intubated and sedated after experiencing desaturation on non-rebreather mask.

The patient has a broad differential diagnosis, including infectious pneumonia, bacterial or viral, PCP, heart failure, third spacing due to malnutrition into lungs, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, Wegener's granulomatosis, and Goodpasture's syndrome.

The patient is currently on empiric coverage for HCAP and PCP with Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro and IV Bactrim. She has a negative swab for influenza, and her chest x-ray and physical exam are consistent with pulmonary edema, possibly secondary to diastolic dysfunction.

The patient has a history of malnutrition, which may be contributing to her hypoxia. She has also been unable to swallow due to dysmotility, possibly secondary to previous radiation.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia of chronic disease, thrombocytopenia, and elevated cardiac enzymes. She has a history of hypothyroidism and is currently taking levothyroxine IV.

The patient's medications include fentanyl, midazolam, famotidine, heparin, morphine, and lasix. She has a PICC line and is receiving IV fluids.

The patient's plan includes continuing current vent settings, continuing empiric coverage for HCAP and PCP, bronchoscopy with BAL today, checking BNP and ANCA, and having a cardiac echo today. She will also have a strict fluid balance and daily weights.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure/hypoxia
* Infectious pneumonia
* Bacterial or viral pneumonia
* PCP
* Heart failure
* Third spacing due to malnutrition into lungs
* Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage
* Wegener's granulomatosis
* Goodpasture's syndrome
* Anemia
* Thrombocytopenia
* Hypothyroidism
* Malnutrition
* Hypertension
* Atrial fibrillation
* Renal failure
* Acute tubular necrosis
* Adrenal insufficiency

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU pending a decrease in oxygen requirement."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo F w/ severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary
   edema, now intubated and sedated.
   #.  Respiratory Failure/Hypoxia:
   Had episode of desat on NRB, not responsive to Lasix and was
   intubated.  Continues to have a broad differential diagnosis.  Has
   negative swab for influenza, and chest xray and physical exam most
   consistent with pulmonary edema, possible secondary to diastolic
   dysfunction.  She has low oncotic pressures secondary to malnutrition.
   Also started empiric pneumonia and PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 10187**] yesterday in setting of
   lack of clinical improvement.  Likely has worsening volume overload and
   acute renal failure making diuresis difficult.
   - Continue vent settings
   - Continue empiric coverage for HCAP, PCP with [**Name9 (PRE) 2601**]/Cefepime/Cipro and
   IV Bactrim
   - Have dc
ed droplet precautions
   - Urine legionella Ag negative
   - FU respiratory culture
   - [**Name9 (PRE) **] today
   - Cardiac enzymes higher than previous but stable and likely elevated
   troponins due to renal failure
   - strict I/O
   - daily weights
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Baseline Cr 1-1.3, Most likely [**1-4**] diuresis in the setting of diastolic
   dysfunction. Urine sediment bland, no muddy brown casts.   Urine lytes
   c/w prerenal cause, poor forward flow vs. hypovolemia.  Renal U/S shows
   no e/o obstruction.
   - Will continue to diurese at this point and monitor for response.  If
   no clinical improvement, may need to re-address.
   -Trend Cr, UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   #.  Malnutrition:
   Has been unable to swallow [**1-4**] dysmotility, possibly secondary to
   previous radiation. Contributing to her hypoxia.
   - NPO for now in the setting of respiratory distress.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PICC and initiation of TPN if patient not going to be a
   candidate for dobhoff due to her poor respiratory status
   #. Anemia:
   Appears to be anemia of chronic disease from iron studies on [**2168-10-19**]
   with increased ferritin, essentially preserved iron to TIBC ratio.
   Given macrocytic, may be a contribution from hypothyrodism.   HCT
   stable since [**2168-10-16**].
   - Trend HCT
   #. Thrombocytopenia:
   HIT antibody negative, possibly related to poor nutritional status.
   - Trend thromboyctopenia
   #. BCL:
   Has been in remission but LDH rising.
   - f/u onc recs
   #.  Hypothyroid:
   - Continue levothyroxine IV
   #Cutaneous cadidiasis:
   Intertriginal erythema
   - Continue miconazole powder
   #  Hypertension:
   - Hold diltiazem while actively diuresing
   #.  Atrial fibrillation
   -Hold all rate control meds for now while diuresing

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo F w/ severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary
   edema, now intubated and sedated.
   #.  Respiratory Failure/Hypoxia:
   Had episode of desat on NRB, not responsive to Lasix and was
   intubated.  Continues to have a broad differential diagnosis.  Has
   negative swab for influenza, and chest xray and physical exam most
   consistent with pulmonary edema, possible secondary to diastolic
   dysfunction.  She has low oncotic pressures secondary to malnutrition.
   Also started empiric pneumonia and PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 10187**] yesterday in setting of
   lack of clinical improvement.  Likely has worsening volume overload and
   acute renal failure making diuresis difficult.
   - Continue vent settings
   - Continue empiric coverage for HCAP, PCP with [**Name9 (PRE) 2601**]/Cefepime/Cipro and
   IV Bactrim
   - Have dc
ed droplet precautions
   - Urine legionella Ag negative
   - FU respiratory culture
   - [**Name9 (PRE) **] today
   - Cardiac enzymes higher than previous but stable and likely elevated
   troponins due to renal failure
   - strict I/O
   - daily weights
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Baseline Cr 1-1.3, Most likely [**1-4**] diuresis in the setting of diastolic
   dysfunction. Urine sediment bland, no muddy brown casts.   Urine lytes
   c/w prerenal cause, poor forward flow vs. hypovolemia.  Renal U/S shows
   no e/o obstruction.
   - Will continue to diurese at this point and monitor for response.  If
   no clinical improvement, may need to re-address.
   -Trend Cr, UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   #.  Malnutrition:
   Has been unable to swallow [**1-4**] dysmotility, possibly secondary to
   previous radiation. Contributing to her hypoxia.
   - NPO for now in the setting of respiratory distress.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PICC and initiation of TPN if patient not going to be a
   candidate for dobhoff due to her poor respiratory status
   #. Anemia:
   Appears to be anemia of chronic disease from iron studies on [**2168-10-19**]
   with increased ferritin, essentially preserved iron to TIBC ratio.
   Given macrocytic, may be a contribution from hypothyrodism.   HCT
   stable since [**2168-10-16**].
   - Trend HCT
   #. Thrombocytopenia:
   HIT antibody negative, possibly related to poor nutritional status.
   - Trend thromboyctopenia
   #. BCL:
   Has been in remission but LDH rising.
   - f/u onc recs
   #.  Hypothyroid:
   - Continue levothyroxine IV
   #Cutaneous cadidiasis:
   Intertriginal erythema
   - Continue miconazole powder
   #  Hypertension:
   - Hold diltiazem while actively diuresing
   #.  Atrial fibrillation
   -Hold all rate control meds for now while diuresing

   Disposition: ICU pending decrease in O2 requirement<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient has a history of severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary edema.

The patient's recent events include:

* Stopping metolazone in the morning due to inability to take PO
* Low urine output and stopping Lasix gtt
* Starting Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro for HAP and Bactrim IV for PCP tx
* Gave 1L D5W for hypernatremia
* Flu swab negative, legionella antigen pending, discontinued respiratory precautions and Tamiflu
* Increasing respiratory distress after stopping Lasix gtt, got ABG (7.33/36/184/20/-6) and CXR looked relatively stable with an increase in interstitial
* Placed on face mask at 15L due to pO2 of 184, tolerated well for a few hours, then placed back on NRB
* Desatted on NRB with increasing respiratory distress, gas showed 7.32/39/60/21, tried 80mg IV Lasix, couldn't get O2 sats >88-89%, ended up intubating

The patient's current status includes:

* Intubated and sedated
* On invasive ventilation
* Worsening respiratory failure/hypoxia
* Negative swab for influenza, chest xray and physical exam most consistent with pulmonary edema, possible secondary to diastolic dysfunction
* Low oncotic pressures secondary to malnutrition
* Empiric coverage for HCAP, PCP with Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro and IV Bactrim
* Dropped droplet precautions
* Urine legionella Ag negative
* FU respiratory culture
* Cardiac enzymes higher than previous but stable and likely elevated troponins due to renal failure
* Strict I/O
* Daily weights

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia
* PCP
* Respiratory failure
* Hypoxia
* Pulmonary edema
* Diastolic dysfunction
* Renal failure
* Malnutrition
* Anemia
* Thrombocytopenia
* BCL
* Hypothyroidism
* Cutaneous candidiasis
* Hypertension
* Atrial fibrillation

Based on the patient's current status and recent events, it is recommended to:

* Continue vent settings
* Continue empiric coverage for HCAP, PCP with Vanc/Cefepime/Cipro and IV Bactrim
* Dropped droplet precautions
* FU respiratory culture
* Trend Cr, UOP
* Renally dose all meds
* Avoid nephrotoxins
* Trend HCT
* Trend thromboyctopenia
* FU onc recs
* Continue levothyroxine IV
* Continue miconazole powder
* Hold diltiazem while actively diuresing
