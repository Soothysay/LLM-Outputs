You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple comorbidities. The patient has a history of heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 104/57 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 60s, which dropped to low 50s during cleaning and was corrected with the reconnection of dopamine. The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,050 mL and a total output of 610 mL, with a negative balance of 440 mL.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99%, and the arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.42, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 39 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 310 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL, platelet count of 142 K/uL, and creatinine of 3.2 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T level is 0.11 ng/mL, and the cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, and Troponin-T) are elevated.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and cardiac enzymes suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of heart failure and complete heart block (CHB) increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation increase the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia and hypercapnia.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests the possibility of renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances.
5. Infection: The patient's indwelling catheters and tubes increase the risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.

The patient's treatment plan includes continued mechanical ventilation, dopamine infusion, and fluid management. The patient's laboratory results will be closely monitored to assess for signs of sepsis, cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory failure, renal failure, and infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 86y/o M with a PMH of biventricular CHF with EF 15%, s/p
   CABG [**2167**] presenting with complete heart block.
   .
   #. Complete Heart Block -  The patient has a history of brady/tachy
   physiology per outpatient cardiologist most recently in slow atrial
   flutter at 3:1 AV block. He has previously declined pacer placement.
   Now presenting with CHB, most likely representing progression of his
   underlying conduction disease. Pt was found to be hyperkalemic on
   presentation (8 hemolyzed) 6.0 on repeat here. Required urgent
   transvenous pacer and intubation for bradycardia and hypotension
   - Transvenous pacer in place - will confirm placement with CXR,
   currently pacing at 60 bpm
   - Plan for permanent pacemaker today per EP
   - Monitor K - recheck and given additional kayexelate if needed. K 6.0
   in ED, received 30g kayexelate.
   - Continue supportive management with intubation, BP support
   .
   #. Severe Biventricular Heart Failure - per report EF 15-20% with
   moderate MR and AS. Per outpatient cardiologist reports the patient has
   had progressive volume overload with ascities, pleural effusion and
   distended neck veins despite increase in lasix
   - repeat [**Name (NI) **]
   - Pt with evidence of volume overload on exam with pleural effusions,
   LE edema and elevated JVP
   - Will stabalize hemodynamic with pacer and then restart diuresis (60mg
   lasix + metolazone QOD outpatient regimen) given volume overload will
   need IV diuresis
   - Holding coreg, for now given bradycardia, restart post pacemaker
   placement
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - K 6.0 on arrival, likely in setting of worsening
   renal failure and hypotension, kayexelate 30gm given in ED
   - will repeat now and give additional kayexelate in needed
   .
   #. Pleural Effusion - no clear evidence of PNA on CXR, likely pulmonary
   edema related to severe CHF, no elevated WBC or fever, recently treated
   for PNA with levaquin/azithro
   - Will diurese when hemodynamically stable
   - Follow CXR for improvement of effusion, evidence of PNA
   .
   #. CAD - s/p CABG (4Vd in [**2167**]) - continue aspirin 81mg daily, continue
   lipitor 10mg daily
   - trend biomarkers
   .
   #. CKD - Cr 3.2 on admission, history of CKD with Cr ranging from 2.5-3
   - continue to trend
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #. HTN - holding coreg given hypotension/bradycardia
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of biventricular heart failure, complete heart block, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted with severe heart failure, hyperkalemia, and pleural effusion. The patient required urgent transvenous pacing and intubation due to bradycardia and hypotension. He is currently being managed with supportive care, including intubation, BP support, and diuresis. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine, potassium, and troponin-T levels, indicating worsening renal failure and cardiac injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Heart Failure: The patient's severe heart failure may continue to deteriorate, leading to further volume overload, pulmonary edema, and respiratory failure.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) increase the risk of acute kidney injury or further deterioration of kidney function.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels may continue to fluctuate, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias, bradycardia, or asystole.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's pleural effusion may be a sign of underlying pneumonia, which could worsen his respiratory status and increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lack of clear evidence of pneumonia on CXR increase the risk of sepsis, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and complete heart block increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe heart failure and pleural effusion may lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation and increasing the risk of ventilator-associated complications.

Based on these potential complications, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status, and to adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 86y/o M with a PMH of biventricular CHF with EF 15%, s/p
   CABG [**2167**] presenting with complete heart block.
   .
   #. Complete Heart Block -  The patient has a history of brady/tachy
   physiology per outpatient cardiologist most recently in slow atrial
   flutter at 3:1 AV block. He has previously declined pacer placement.
   Now presenting with CHB, most likely representing progression of his
   underlying conduction disease. Pt was found to be hyperkalemic on
   presentation (8 hemolyzed) 6.0 on repeat here. Required urgent
   transvenous pacer and intubation for bradycardia and hypotension
   - Transvenous pacer in place - will confirm placement with CXR,
   currently pacing at 60 bpm
   - Plan for permanent pacemaker today per EP
   - Monitor K - recheck and given additional kayexelate if needed. K 6.0
   in ED, received 30g kayexelate.
   - Continue supportive management with intubation, BP support
   .
   #. Severe Biventricular Heart Failure - per report EF 15-20% with
   moderate MR and AS. Per outpatient cardiologist reports the patient has
   had progressive volume overload with ascities, pleural effusion and
   distended neck veins despite increase in lasix
   - repeat [**Name (NI) **]
   - Pt with evidence of volume overload on exam with pleural effusions,
   LE edema and elevated JVP
   - Will stabalize hemodynamic with pacer and then restart diuresis (60mg
   lasix + metolazone QOD outpatient regimen) given volume overload will
   need IV diuresis
   - Holding coreg, for now given bradycardia, restart post pacemaker
   placement
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - K 6.0 on arrival, likely in setting of worsening
   renal failure and hypotension, kayexelate 30gm given in ED
   - will repeat now and give additional kayexelate in needed
   .
   #. Pleural Effusion - no clear evidence of PNA on CXR, likely pulmonary
   edema related to severe CHF, no elevated WBC or fever, recently treated
   for PNA with levaquin/azithro
   - Will diurese when hemodynamically stable
   - Follow CXR for improvement of effusion, evidence of PNA
   .
   #. CAD - s/p CABG (4Vd in [**2167**]) - continue aspirin 81mg daily, continue
   lipitor 10mg daily
   - trend biomarkers
   .
   #. CKD - Cr 3.2 on admission, history of CKD with Cr ranging from 2.5-3
   - continue to trend
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #. HTN - holding coreg given hypotension/bradycardia
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia - continue statin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of biventricular heart failure, complete heart block, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with hyperkalemia, hypotension, and bradycardia, requiring urgent transvenous pacing and intubation. He has a history of severe biventricular heart failure with moderate mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis, and has been experiencing progressive volume overload with ascites, pleural effusion, and distended neck veins.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Bradycardia and hypotension due to complete heart block and worsening heart failure
	* Potential for cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest
2. Renal Complications:
	* Worsening renal failure due to hypotension, bradycardia, and hyperkalemia
	* Potential for acute kidney injury or acute on chronic kidney disease
3. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pneumonia or respiratory failure due to pleural effusion and pulmonary edema
	* Potential for respiratory arrest or failure
4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Bowel obstruction or perforation due to severe heart failure and bowel edema
	* Potential for gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation
5. Hematological Complications:
	* Anemia due to chronic kidney disease and bleeding
	* Potential for bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy
6. Infection Complications:
	* Sepsis or septic shock due to pneumonia, pleural effusion, or other infections
	* Potential for multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his cardiac, renal, respiratory, and gastrointestinal status. He should be continued on supportive management with intubation, BP support, and diuresis. The plan for permanent pacemaker placement should be followed, and the patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and diuretics should be adjusted as needed. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and oxygen therapy should be continued as needed. The patient's gastrointestinal status should be closely monitored, and bowel regimens should be adjusted as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 86y/o M with a PMH of biventricular CHF with EF 15%, s/p
   CABG [**2167**] presenting with complete heart block.
   .
   #. Complete Heart Block -  The patient has a history of brady/tachy
   physiology per outpatient cardiologist most recently in slow atrial
   flutter at 3:1 AV block. He has previously declined pacer placement.
   Now presenting with CHB, most likely representing progression of his
   underlying conduction disease.
   - Permanent pacer placed yesterday
   - Continues to require low dose dopamine for BP support
   - Continue supportive management with intubation, BP support
   .
   #. Severe Biventricular Heart Failure - per report EF 15-20% with
   moderate MR and AS. Per outpatient cardiologist reports the patient has
   had progressive volume overload with ascities, pleural effusion and
   distended neck veins despite increase in lasix
   - repeat TTE today
   - Pt with evidence of volume overload on exam with pleural effusions,
   LE edema and elevated JVP
   - Will stabalize hemodynamic with pacer and then restart diuresis (60mg
   lasix + metolazone QOD outpatient regimen) given volume overload will
   need IV diuresis
   - Holding coreg, for now given bradycardia/hypotension, restart post
   pacemaker placement
   .
   #. Pleural Effusion - no clear evidence of PNA on CXR, likely pulmonary
   edema related to severe CHF, no elevated WBC or fever, recently treated
   for PNA with levaquin/azithro
   - Will diurese when hemodynamically stable
   - Follow CXR for improvement of effusion, evidence of PNA
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia - resolved
   .
   #. CAD - s/p CABG (4Vd in [**2167**]) - continue aspirin 81mg daily, continue
   lipitor 10mg daily
   - trend biomarkers
   .
   #. CKD - Cr 3.2 on admission, history of CKD with Cr ranging from 2.5-3
   - continue to trend
   - renally dose meds
   .
   #. HTN - holding coreg given hypotension/bradycardia
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia - continue statin
   .
   #. FEN - NPO for now
   .
   #. Access: L art line, PIV X3

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of biventricular heart failure, complete heart block, and severe coronary artery disease. He was admitted to the ICU with a heart rate of 80 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 104/57 mmHg. He has been intubated and sedated, and is receiving dopamine to support his blood pressure. His creatinine level is elevated at 3.2 mg/dL, and he has a history of chronic kidney disease.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Complete Heart Block: The patient has a history of brady/tachy physiology and has been diagnosed with complete heart block. A permanent pacemaker was placed yesterday.
2. Severe Biventricular Heart Failure: The patient has a history of severe heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15-20%. He has moderate mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis, and has developed pleural effusions, leg edema, and elevated jugular venous pressure.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion on the right side, which is likely related to his severe heart failure.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level was elevated at admission, but has since resolved.
5. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease with a creatinine level of 3.2 mg/dL.
6. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is on a statin medication to manage his hyperlipidemia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's complete heart block and severe heart failure increase his risk of cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pleural effusion and leg edema increase his risk of respiratory failure, particularly if his respiratory status worsens.
3. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and elevated creatinine level increase his risk of acute kidney injury or worsening of his chronic kidney disease.
4. Infection: The patient's pleural effusion and leg edema increase his risk of infection, particularly if he develops pneumonia or sepsis.
5. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications and his history of coronary artery disease increase his risk of bleeding complications.
6. Stroke or transient ischemic attack: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and heart failure increase his risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack.

Plan:

1. Continue supportive management with intubation, blood pressure support, and diuresis as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
3. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his oxygen therapy as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his diuretic regimen as needed.
5. Consider placing a central venous catheter if the patient is unable to wean off dopamine.
6. Continue to trend the patient's biomarkers and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
7. Consider referring the patient to a nephrologist for further management of his chronic kidney disease."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 86y/o M with a PMH of biventricular CHF with EF 15%, s/p
   CABG [**2167**] presenting with complete heart block.
   .
   #. Complete Heart Block -  The patient has a history of brady/tachy
   physiology per outpatient cardiologist most recently in slow atrial
   flutter at 3:1 AV block. He has previously declined pacer placement.
   Now presenting with CHB, most likely representing progression of his
   underlying conduction disease.
   - Permanent pacer placed yesterday
   - Continues to require low dose dopamine for BP support
   - Continue supportive management with intubation, BP support
   .
   #. Severe Biventricular Heart Failure - per report EF 15-20% with
   moderate MR and AS. Per outpatient cardiologist reports the patient has
   had progressive volume overload with ascities, pleural effusion and
   distended neck veins despite increase in lasix
   - repeat [**Year (4 digits) **] today
   - Pt with evidence of volume overload on exam with pleural effusions,
   LE edema and elevated JVP
   - Will stabalize hemodynamic with pacer and then restart diuresis (60mg
   lasix + metolazone QOD outpatient regimen) given volume overload will
   need IV diuresis
   - Holding coreg, for now given bradycardia/hypotension, restart post
   pacemaker placement
   .
   #. Pleural Effusion - no clear evidence of PNA on CXR, likely pulmonary
   edema related to severe CHF, no elevated WBC or fever, recently treated
   for PNA with levaquin/azithro
   - Will diurese when hemodynamically stable
   - Follow CXR for improvement of effusion, evidence of PNA

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - MAPs dropped to low 50s during cleaning, pt was having large watery
   bowel movement. Dopa found to be disconnected. MAPs improved to above
   60s after Dopa resumed.
   - PPM placed, pt had brief episode of hypotension to 70s systolic when
   dopa interrupted, improved back to 110s systolic on Dopa 5
   - Held off on diuresis given continued pressor requirement
   - Cr elevated this admission to 3.2, baseline 2.2 previously ([**2167**]).
   Urine lytes pending
   - Pt failed two attempts to switch to PSV due to hypotension, with MAPS
   dropping over minutes, once from 67->60, and again 73->63. Improved
   with increased Dopa. Does ok from respiratory standpoint with switch.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of biventricular heart failure, complete heart block, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted with severe biventricular heart failure, pleural effusion, and hyperkalemia. He underwent permanent pacer placement and continues to require low-dose dopamine for blood pressure support. He is currently intubated and sedated.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with multiple episodes of hypotension and decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) requiring increased dopamine infusion. He has also experienced brief episodes of hypotension when dopamine was interrupted. His respiratory status has been stable, with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 107.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine (3.2 mg/dL) and potassium (4.9 mEq/L), indicating chronic kidney disease. His troponin-T level is elevated at 0.11 ng/mL, indicating cardiac injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's frequent episodes of hypotension and decreased MAP may indicate a need for further evaluation and management to prevent further episodes.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's severe biventricular heart failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further volume overload and respiratory distress.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient's elevated creatinine and potassium levels indicate chronic kidney disease, which may require further evaluation and management to prevent further decline in renal function.
4. Cardiac Injury: The patient's elevated troponin-T level indicates cardiac injury, which may require further evaluation and management to prevent further cardiac damage.
5. Respiratory Distress: The patient's pleural effusion and respiratory status may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory distress and further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and MAP closely to prevent further episodes of hypotension.
2. Adjust the patient's dopamine infusion as needed to maintain a stable blood pressure.
3. Continue to manage the patient's heart failure with diuretics and other medications as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely to prevent further decline in renal function.
5. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's cardiac injury to prevent further cardiac damage.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely to prevent further respiratory distress."

   #. Complete Heart Block -  The patient has a history of brady/tachy
   physiology per outpatient cardiologist most recently in slow atrial
   flutter at 3:1 AV block. He has previously declined pacer placement.
   Now presenting with CHB, most likely representing progression of his
   underlying conduction disease.  Patient is s/p permanent pacemaker now
   off all pressor support.  PPM set at a rate of 60 currently.
   - Day [**12-27**] clindamycin

   #. Acute on chronic Severe Biventricular Systolic Heart Failure - per
   report EF 15-20% with moderate MR and AS. Per outpatient cardiologist
   reports the patient has had progressive volume overload with ascities,
   pleural effusion and distended neck veins despite increase in lasix.
   Echo repeated on admission demonstrates asymmetric septal hypertrophy
   with mild resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Severe
   regional systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and
   inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of the septum. Marked right
   ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Patient still with evidence of volume overload on exam with pleural
   effusions, elevated JVP.
   - now that extubated will try for gentle diuresis with goal -500 cc per
   day however will be careful given severe dysfunction of right ventricle
   making patient very preload dependent.  Given 20mg IV lasix this AM.

   - Will need to restart diuresis (60mg lasix + metolazone QOD outpatient
   regimen) on discharge
   .
   #. Pleural Effusion - no clear evidence of PNA on CXR, likely pulmonary
   edema related to severe CHF, no elevated WBC or fever, recently treated
   for PNA with levaquin/azithromycin.  As patient now extubated will
   check PA/Lateral to assess.
   -          f/u chest x-ray

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of biventricular heart failure, complete heart block, and coronary artery disease. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and was recently placed with a permanent pacemaker due to complete heart block. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and was recently extubated. He is currently being treated for acute on chronic severe biventricular systolic heart failure, pleural effusion, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and recent respiratory failure puts him at risk for recurrent respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's yellow sputum mixed with blood and recent antibiotic use may indicate a potential infection, which could lead to sepsis.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of complete heart block and recent pacemaker placement puts him at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
4. Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and recent elevation in creatinine levels may indicate worsening renal function, which could lead to acute kidney injury.
5. Volume overload: The patient's history of heart failure and recent pleural effusion puts him at risk for volume overload, which could lead to worsening heart failure and respiratory failure.
6. Infection: The patient's recent antibiotic use and current sputum culture may indicate a potential infection, which could lead to sepsis or other complications.
7. Dementia: The patient's history of dementia may affect his ability to respond to medical interventions and increase the risk of complications.
8. Hematuria: The patient's hematuria and pain at the Foley site may indicate a potential urinary tract infection or other complications.
9. Hypertension: The patient's recent hypertension may indicate worsening cardiac function and increase the risk of cardiac complications.
10. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's history of hyperlipidemia may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various medical complications due to his underlying medical conditions and recent hospital course. Close monitoring and management of these conditions are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 86y/o M with a PMH of biventricular CHF with EF 15%, s/p
   CABG [**2167**] presenting with complete heart block.
   .
   #. Complete Heart Block -  The patient has a history of brady/tachy
   physiology per outpatient cardiologist most recently in slow atrial
   flutter at 3:1 AV block. He has previously declined pacer placement.
   Now presenting with CHB, most likely representing progression of his
   underlying conduction disease.  Patient is s/p permanent pacemaker now
   off all pressor support.  PPM set at a rate of 60 currently.
   - Day [**12-27**] clindamycin
   .
   # Respiratory failure now resolved
 patient was intubated in the
   setting of complete heart block episode.  Major initial barrio to
   extubation was patient
s mental status.  ? PNA given increased sputum
   production.
   - Sputum culture today.
   - f/u PA/Lat CXR
   .
   #. Acute on chronic Severe Biventricular Systolic Heart Failure - per
   report EF 15-20% with moderate MR and AS. Per outpatient cardiologist
   reports the patient has had progressive volume overload with ascities,
   pleural effusion and distended neck veins despite increase in lasix.
   Echo repeated on admission demonstrates asymmetric septal hypertrophy
   with mild resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Severe
   regional systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and
   inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of the septum. Marked right
   ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Patient still with evidence of volume overload on exam with pleural
   effusions, elevated JVP.
   - now that extubated will try for gentle diuresis with goal -500 cc per
   day however will be careful given severe dysfunction of right ventricle
   making patient very preload dependent.  Given 20mg IV lasix this AM.
   Follow Is/Os.
   - Will need to restart diuresis (60mg lasix + metolazone QOD outpatient
   regimen) on discharge
   .
   #. Pleural Effusion - no clear evidence of PNA on CXR, likely pulmonary
   edema related to severe CHF, no elevated WBC or fever, recently treated
   for PNA with levaquin/azithromycin.  As patient now extubated will
   check PA/Lateral to assess.
   -          f/u chest x-ray
   -          gentle diuesis as above
   .
   #. CAD - s/p CABG (4Vd in [**2167**]) - continue aspirin 81mg daily, continue
   lipitor 10mg daily. Troponins on admission mildly elevated but flat in
   the setting of renal failure.
   .
   #. CKD - Cr 3.2 on admission, history of CKD with Cr ranging from
   2.5-3. Cr improved today to 2.7.
   - continue to trend
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Dementia- patient with underlying dementia as per his son.
   -          avoid benzodiazepines
   -          avoid anti-cholinergic medications
   -          Did well with Haldol 0.5mg yesterday.  Continue PRN.
   .
   # Hematuria: Pt with pain at site.  Foley irrigates ok.
   - Monitor foley output.  Bladder scan.
   .
   #. HTN
 patient now with hypertension to 140s after being extubated
   - restart coreg today at half outpatient dose.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia - continue statin

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of biventricular congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, who presented with complete heart block (CHB) and was subsequently placed on a permanent pacemaker. The patient was initially intubated due to respiratory failure but was successfully extubated.

The patient's cardiovascular system is severely compromised, with marked right ventricular dilation and dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and evidence of volume overload on examination. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is currently on hemodialysis.

The patient's respiratory system is also compromised, with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was treated with mechanical ventilation and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) but was successfully extubated.

The patient's neurological system is compromised due to his underlying dementia and the use of sedatives and anxiolytics.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), indicating kidney dysfunction. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are normal, but his electrolyte levels are slightly elevated.

The patient's medical history includes a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The patient's medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, and metoprolol, which are all contraindicated in patients with CKD.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of CHB and is currently on a permanent pacemaker, which may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD and ARDS, which may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Kidney dysfunction: The patient has a history of CKD and is currently on hemodialysis, which may increase the risk of kidney dysfunction.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is currently on antibiotics, which may increase the risk of infection.
5. Bleeding: The patient is on anticoagulation therapy, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of dementia and is currently on sedatives and anxiolytics, which may increase the risk of neurological complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Management of cardiac arrhythmias with anti-arrhythmic medications.
3. Management of respiratory failure with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and oxygen therapy.
4. Management of kidney dysfunction with hemodialysis and electrolyte replacement.
5. Management of infection with antibiotics and supportive care.
6. Management of bleeding with anticoagulation therapy and blood transfusions.
7. Management of neurological complications with sedatives and anxiolytics and neurological consultation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a post-pacemaker placement patient with complete heart block, now being monitored in the ICU. The patient was previously on sedation, but was weaned off and extubated successfully. The patient has a history of heart failure, acute on chronic, with systolic and diastolic dysfunction. They also have respiratory failure, acute, not ARDS. The patient's skin integrity is impaired, and they have a history of hypotension, not shock.

The patient's current vital signs are: Tmax 37.4°C, Tcurrent 36.6°C, HR 60 bpm, BP 142/63 mmHg, RR 25 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 100%. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen and CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's physical examination is notable for symmetric chest expansion, rhonchorous breath sounds, and absent peripheral pulses.

Laboratory results show:

* WBC 8.2
* Hct 37.0%
* Plt 142
* Cr 3.2 mg/dL
* TropT 0.11 ng/mL
* TCO2 26 mmHg
* Glucose 137 mg/dL
* Other labs show normal PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, and LDH.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of complete heart block and pacemaker placement, there is a risk of pacemaker malfunction or cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure and use of CPAP/PSV ventilation increase the risk of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Skin complications: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of skin breakdown, pressure ulcers, or infection.
4. Renal complications: The patient's history of heart failure and acute kidney injury (AKI) increases the risk of worsening renal function or acute kidney injury.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and history of cardiac arrest increase the risk of neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, or brain death.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and address these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 86y/o M with a PMH of biventricular CHF with EF 15%, s/p
   CABG [**2167**] presenting with complete heart block.
   .
   #. Complete Heart Block -  The patient has a history of brady/tachy
   physiology per outpatient cardiologist most recently in slow atrial
   flutter at 3:1 AV block. He has previously declined pacer placement.
   Now presenting with CHB, most likely representing progression of his
   underlying conduction disease.  Patient is s/p permanent pacemaker now
   off all pressor support.
   .
   # Respiratory failure now resolved
 patient was intubated in the
   setting of complete heart block episode.  Major initial barrio to
   extubation was patient
s mental status.
   .
   #. Acute on chronic Severe Biventricular Systolic Heart Failure - per
   report EF 15-20% with moderate MR and AS. Per outpatient cardiologist
   reports the patient has had progressive volume overload with ascities,
   pleural effusion and distended neck veins despite increase in lasix.
   Echo repeated on admission demonstrates asymmetric septal hypertrophy
   with mild resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Severe
   regional systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and
   inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of the septum. Marked right
   ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Patient still with evidence of volume overload on exam with pleural
   effusions, elevated JVP.
   - now that extubated will try for gentle diuresis with goal -500 cc per
   day however will be careful given severe dysfunction of right ventricle
   making patient very preload dependent
   - Will need to restart diuresis (60mg lasix + metolazone QOD outpatient
   regimen) on discharge
   - restart coreg today
   .
   #. Pleural Effusion - no clear evidence of PNA on CXR, likely pulmonary
   edema related to severe CHF, no elevated WBC or fever, recently treated
   for PNA with levaquin/azithromycin.  As patient now extubated will
   check PA/Lateral to assess.
   -          f/u chest x-ray
   -          gentle diuesis as above
   .
   #. CAD - s/p CABG (4Vd in [**2167**]) - continue aspirin 81mg daily, continue
   lipitor 10mg daily. Troponins on admission mildly elevated but flat in
   the setting of renal failure.
   .
   #. CKD - Cr 3.2 on admission, history of CKD with Cr ranging from
   2.5-3. Cr improved today to 2.7.
   - continue to trend
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Dementia- patient with underlying dementia as per his son.
   -          avoid benzodiazepines
   -          avoid anti-cholinergic medications
   .
   #. HTN
 patient now with hypertension to 140s after being extubated

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of biventricular congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 15%, who presented with complete heart block (CHB). The patient has undergone a permanent pacemaker placement and is currently off all pressor support.

The patient's respiratory failure has been resolved, and he has been extubated. However, he remains at risk for respiratory complications due to his underlying severe biventricular systolic heart failure. The patient has evidence of volume overload on examination with pleural effusions and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP).

The patient's laboratory results show mild elevations in troponin and creatine kinase (CK), which may be related to his underlying cardiac disease. His kidney function has improved, and he is currently being treated with diuretics and other medications.

The patient's medical history includes dementia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer due to his underlying medical conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying severe biventricular systolic heart failure and pleural effusions may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of complete heart block and underlying cardiac disease may lead to cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Renal failure: The patient's underlying CKD and potential for volume overload may lead to renal failure.
4. Infection: The patient's underlying medical conditions and recent antibiotic use may increase his risk for infection.
5. DVT: The patient's underlying medical conditions and immobility may increase his risk for DVT.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient's underlying medical conditions and potential for volume overload may lead to stress ulcer.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is recommended that he be closely monitored for any signs of respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, renal failure, infection, DVT, and stress ulcer. The patient's medications should be closely monitored and adjusted as needed to prevent these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 86y/o M with a PMH of biventricular CHF with EF 15%, s/p
   CABG [**2167**] presenting with complete heart block. He is not s/p PMP doing
   well from a cardiac standpoint with ongoing delirium s/p intubation.
   .
   #. Complete Heart Block -  The patient has a history of brady/tachy
   physiology per outpatient cardiologist most recently in slow atrial
   flutter at 3:1 AV block. He has previously declined pacer placement.
   Now presenting with CHB, most likely representing progression of his
   underlying conduction disease.  Patient is s/p permanent pacemaker now
   off all pressor support.  PPM set at a rate of 60 currently.
   - Day [**1-24**] clindamycin
   .
   # Respiratory failure now resolved
 patient was intubated in the
   setting of complete heart block episode.  Major initial barrio to
   extubation was patient
s mental status.  ? PNA given increased sputum
   production.
   - Resp status stable
   - Pt with ongoing sputum production.
   - Sputum culture today.
   .
   #. Acute on chronic Severe Biventricular Systolic Heart Failure - per
   report EF 15-20% with moderate MR and AS. Per outpatient cardiologist
   reports the patient has had progressive volume overload with ascities,
   pleural effusion and distended neck veins despite increase in lasix.
   Echo repeated on admission demonstrates asymmetric septal hypertrophy
   with mild resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. Severe
   regional systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the inferior and
   inferolateral walls and hypokinesis of the septum. Marked right
   ventricular dilation and dysfunction. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Patient still with evidence of volume overload on exam with pleural
   effusions, elevated JVP.
   - now that extubated will try for gentle diuresis given severe
   dysfunction of right ventricle making patient very preload dependent.
   Was even for the day yesterday
   - Received 20mg IV yesterday with >1L UOP. Received second dose this AM
   - Will need to restart diuresis (60mg lasix + metolazone QOD outpatient
   regimen) on discharge
   .
   #. Pleural Effusion - no clear evidence of PNA on CXR, likely pulmonary
   edema related to severe CHF, no elevated WBC or fever, recently treated
   for PNA with levaquin/azithromycin.  As patient now extubated will
   check PA/Lateral to assess.
   -          CXR seems stable
   -          gentle diuesis as above
   .
   #. CAD - s/p CABG (4Vd in [**2167**]) - continue aspirin 81mg daily, continue
   lipitor 10mg daily. Troponins on admission mildly elevated but flat in
   the setting of renal failure.
   .
   #. CKD - Cr 3.2 on admission, history of CKD with Cr ranging from
   2.5-3. Cr improved today to 2.7.
   - continue to trend
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Dementia- patient with underlying dementia as per his son.
   -          avoid benzodiazepines
   -          avoid anti-cholinergic medications
   -          Did well with Haldol 0.5mg yesterday.  Continue PRN.
   .
   # Hematuria: Pt with pain at site.  Foley irrigates ok.
   - Monitor foley output.
   - Bladder scan showed only 30mL residual
   - Started tamsulosin 0.4mg PO HS for BPH
   .
   #. HTN
 patient now with hypertension to 140s after being extubated
   - restarted coreg today at half outpatient dose.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia - continue statin
   .
   #. FEN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of biventricular congestive heart failure (CHF) and complete heart block (CHB). He was admitted with acute on chronic severe biventricular systolic heart failure, respiratory failure, and pleural effusion.

The patient's mental status has improved, and he is now conversant and alert. He was extubated yesterday and is tolerating PO medications well. He continues to complain about his Foley catheter and has ongoing pruritis.

The patient has developed hives on his back, which is unclear in cause but may be related to contact dermatitis. Antihistamines are being held off due to anticholinergic effects.

The patient is receiving carvedilol 6.25mg PO BID and has had a stable hemoglobin count. His potassium levels were repleted in the PM.

The patient has a history of CAD, CKD, dementia, hematuria, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and FEN. He is currently receiving aspirin 81mg daily, lipitor 10mg daily, and tamsulosin 0.4mg PO HS for BPH.

The patient's labs show a white blood cell count of 8.2, hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, and potassium of 4.1 mEq/L. His troponin-T is 0.11, and his lactic acid is 1.1 mmol/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Complete Heart Block: The patient has a history of brady/tachy physiology and is now presenting with CHB. He is s/p permanent pacemaker and is off all pressor support.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to complete heart block episode. He is now extubated and has ongoing sputum production.
3. Acute on chronic Severe Biventricular Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has a history of severe CHF with EF 15-20%. He has had progressive volume overload and is currently receiving diuretic therapy.
4. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion likely related to severe CHF. He will be monitored for further development.
5. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD and is receiving aspirin and lipitor therapy.
6. CKD: The patient has a history of CKD and is receiving renally dosed medications.
7. Dementia: The patient has underlying dementia and is being managed with Haldol therapy.
8. Hematuria: The patient has hematuria and is being monitored for further development.
9. HTN: The patient has hypertension and is being managed with coreg therapy.
10. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia and is receiving statin therapy.
11. FEN: The patient has FEN and is being managed with speech and swallow therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications such as further deterioration of heart function, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest
* Respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, or respiratory arrest
* Renal complications such as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease progression, or electrolyte imbalances
* Hematuria complications such as further bleeding, infection, or chronic kidney disease progression
* Dementia complications such as further cognitive decline, behavioral disturbances, or falls
* HTN complications such as further hypertension, cardiovascular disease progression, or stroke
* Hyperlipidemia complications such as further lipid elevation, cardiovascular disease progression, or pancreatitis
* FEN complications such as further speech and swallow difficulties, aspiration, or malnutrition.

The patient's condition will need to be closely monitored to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 86y/o M with a PMH of biventricular CHF with EF 15%, s/p
   CABG [**2167**] presenting with complete heart block. He is not s/p PMP doing
   well from a cardiac standpoint with ongoing delirium s/p intubation.
   .
   #. Complete Heart Block -  The patient has a history of brady/tachy
   physiology per outpatient cardiologist most recently in slow atrial
   flutter at 3:1 AV block. He has previously declined pacer placement.
   Now presenting with CHB, most likely representing progression of his
   underlying conduction disease.  Patient is s/p permanent pacemaker now
   off all pressor support.  PPM set at a rate of 60 currently.
   - Day [**1-24**] clindamycin
   .
   # Respiratory failure now resolved
 patient was intubated in the
   setting of complete heart block episode.  Major initial barrio to
   extubation was patient
s mental status.  ? PNA given increased sputum
   production.
   - Resp status stable
   - Pt with ongoing sputum production.
   - Sputum culture today.
   .
   #. Acute on chronic Severe Biventricular Systolic Heart Failure
   - restart home diuretic regimen tomorrow.
   .
   #. Pleural Effusion - no clear evidence of PNA on CXR, likely pulmonary
   edema related to severe CHF, no elevated WBC or fever, recently treated
   for PNA with levaquin/azithromycin.  As patient now extubated will
   check PA/Lateral to assess.
   -          CXR seems stable, not clinically acting infected.
   -          gentle diuesis as above
   .
   #. CAD - s/p CABG (4Vd in [**2167**]) - continue aspirin 81mg daily, continue
   lipitor 10mg daily. Troponins on admission mildly elevated but flat in
   the setting of renal failure.
   .
   #. CKD - Cr 3.2 on admission, history of CKD with Cr ranging from
   2.5-3. Cr improved today to 2.7.
   - continue to trend
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Dementia- patient with underlying dementia as per his son.
   -          avoid benzodiazepines
   -          avoid anti-cholinergic medications
   -          Did well with Haldol 0.5mg yesterday.  Continue PRN.
   .
   # Hematuria: Pt with pain at site.  Foley discontinued.
   - Started tamsulosin 0.4mg PO HS for BPH
   .
   #. HTN
 patient now with hypertension to 140s after being extubated
   - restarted coreg today at half outpatient dose.
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 86y/o M with a PMH of biventricular CHF with EF 15%, s/p
   CABG [**2167**] presenting with complete heart block. He is not s/p PMP doing
   well from a cardiac standpoint with ongoing delirium s/p intubation.
   .
   #. Complete Heart Block -  The patient has a history of brady/tachy
   physiology per outpatient cardiologist most recently in slow atrial
   flutter at 3:1 AV block. He has previously declined pacer placement.
   Now presenting with CHB, most likely representing progression of his
   underlying conduction disease.  Patient is s/p permanent pacemaker now
   off all pressor support.  PPM set at a rate of 60 currently.
   - Day [**1-24**] clindamycin
   .
   # Respiratory failure now resolved
 patient was intubated in the
   setting of complete heart block episode.  Major initial barrio to
   extubation was patient
s mental status.  ? PNA given increased sputum
   production.
   - Resp status stable
   - Pt with ongoing sputum production.
   - Sputum culture today.
   .
   #. Acute on chronic Severe Biventricular Systolic Heart Failure
   - restart home diuretic regimen tomorrow.
   .
   #. Pleural Effusion - no clear evidence of PNA on CXR, likely pulmonary
   edema related to severe CHF, no elevated WBC or fever, recently treated
   for PNA with levaquin/azithromycin.  As patient now extubated will
   check PA/Lateral to assess.
   -          CXR seems stable, not clinically acting infected.
   -          gentle diuesis as above
   .
   #. CAD - s/p CABG (4Vd in [**2167**]) - continue aspirin 81mg daily, continue
   lipitor 10mg daily. Troponins on admission mildly elevated but flat in
   the setting of renal failure.
   .
   #. CKD - Cr 3.2 on admission, history of CKD with Cr ranging from
   2.5-3. Cr improved today to 2.7.
   - continue to trend
   - renally dose meds
   .
   # Dementia- patient with underlying dementia as per his son.
   -          avoid benzodiazepines
   -          avoid anti-cholinergic medications
   -          Did well with Haldol 0.5mg yesterday.  Continue PRN.
   .
   # Hematuria: Pt with pain at site.  Foley discontinued.
   - Started tamsulosin 0.4mg PO HS for BPH
   .
   #. HTN
 patient now with hypertension to 140s after being extubated
   - restarted coreg today at half outpatient dose.

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of biventricular heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, who presented with complete heart block and was intubated. The patient has undergone a cardiac catheterization and has a permanent pacemaker. He is currently extubated and receiving oxygen therapy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 60 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 122/64 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98%.

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, and his creatinine level has improved from 3.2 mg/dL to 2.7 mg/dL. He is also receiving treatment for hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

The patient has been experiencing hematuria, and a Foley catheter has been discontinued. He is receiving tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia.

The patient has a history of dementia and is being treated with haloperidol for agitation. He has also been experiencing pruritis, and sarna lotion has been started.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 142 x 10^9/L. His troponin level is 0.11 ng/mL, and his creatinine kinase level is 61 IU/L.

The patient's chest X-ray shows no clear evidence of pneumonia, and his sputum culture has been sent for analysis. He is being treated for respiratory failure with oxygen therapy and is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer.

The patient's plan of care includes restarting his home diuretic regimen, continuing aspirin and lipitor, and monitoring his kidney function. He is also being treated for his underlying medical conditions, including heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of complete heart block and ongoing treatment with a permanent pacemaker, there is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure and may be at risk for recurrent episodes.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture has been sent for analysis, and there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
4. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, but there is still a risk of developing a thrombus.
5. Stress ulcer: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for stress ulcer, but there is still a risk of developing an ulcer.
6. Hematuria: The patient has a history of hematuria and may continue to experience bleeding.
7. Pruritis: The patient is experiencing pruritis and may require further treatment to manage this symptom.
8. Dementia: The patient has a history of dementia and may continue to experience cognitive impairment.
9. Chronic kidney disease: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and may require ongoing monitoring and treatment.
10. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia and may require ongoing treatment to manage this condition."
