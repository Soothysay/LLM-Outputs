   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   34W fervers, HA, ST starting late [**Month (only) **]. Presented to ER early [**Month (only) **]
   and discharged. Symptoms worsened and testing for flu which was
   positive. Again presented to ER [**9-13**] and admitted to ICU for resp
   distress. Tested again pos for flu and mycoplamsa IgM. CT-A showed
   bilateral basal consolidation, small effusions and splenomegaly.
   Treated with vanco and zosyn then vanco and levoflox.
   She developed a transaminitis and had a MRCP. This showed
   hepatosplenomegaly and evidence of postal hypertension. Hepatitis was
   thought to be due to mycoplamsa. Also pancytopenia presumably due to
   sepsis.
   Currently, complains of dry throat, worsening abdominal pain and
   distension, worsening dyspnea.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 34-year-old female who presented to the emergency room with respiratory distress, which worsened despite initial treatment. She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of influenza, mycoplasma pneumonia, and possible superinfection. She developed transaminitis, pancytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Current symptoms include dry throat, worsening abdominal pain and distension, and worsening dyspnea.

The patient has been treated with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and levofloxacin. She has also been prescribed tamiflu and will start lactulose therapy. The plan is to continue broad-spectrum antibiotics and consider bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) for respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pancytopenia and transaminitis may be signs of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Hepatic failure: The patient's elevated transaminases and bilirubin levels may indicate liver dysfunction, which could progress to liver failure.
4. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's abdominal distension and tenderness may indicate the development of abdominal compartment syndrome, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
5. Immunosuppression: The patient's immunosuppressive therapy for Crohn's disease may increase her risk of infection, which could worsen her condition.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's liver dysfunction and abdominal distension may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's sinus tachycardia and elevated lactate levels may indicate cardiac complications, such as myocardial dysfunction or cardiac arrest."

Chief Complaint: resp distress, liver failure
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   34W fevers, HA, ST starting late [**Month (only) **]. Presented to ER early [**Month (only) **] and
   discharged. Symptoms worsened and testing for flu which was positive.
   Again presented to ER [**9-13**] and admitted to ICU for resp distress.
   Tested again pos for flu and mycoplamsa IgM was elevated. CT-A showed
   bilateral basal consolidation, small effusions and splenomegaly.
   Treated with vanco and zosyn then vanco and levoflox.
   She developed a transaminitis and elevated TBili and had a MRCP. This
   showed hepatosplenomegaly and evidence of portal hypertension.
   Hepatitis was thought to be due to mycoplamsa. Also pancytopenia
   presumably due to sepsis in setting of imuran.
   Currently, complains of dry throat, worsening abdominal pain and
   distension, worsening dyspnea.

   today.
   Liver dysfunction / failure  - both elevated transaminases and TBili.
   Unclear explanation - Hepatology to weigh in. Imuran being held. Will
   follow glucose, LFTs, ABG, renal function. Lactulose to be started.
   Will image abdomen and decide on therapeutic paracentesis.

Summary:

The patient is a 34-year-old female who presented to the ER with respiratory distress and liver failure. She had previously been diagnosed with Crohn's disease and was taking immunosuppressive medications, including Imuran and Pentasa. Her symptoms worsened, and she was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress, where she was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her condition deteriorated, and she developed a transaminitis, elevated bilirubin, and pancytopenia. The patient is currently experiencing worsening abdominal pain, distension, and dyspnea. She has a history of allergies to sulfa and Compazine, and has received antibiotics, including Piperacillin/Tazobactam and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may progress to respiratory failure if not managed effectively.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pancytopenia and elevated lactate levels suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ failure if not treated promptly.
3. Hepatic failure: The patient's elevated transaminases and bilirubin levels indicate liver dysfunction, which can lead to hepatic failure if not managed effectively.
4. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's abdominal distension and tenderness may progress to abdominal compartment syndrome, which can lead to organ failure if not managed promptly.
5. Immunosuppression: The patient's immunosuppressive medications may increase her risk of infection and sepsis.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and potential malnutrition may lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, which can exacerbate her condition.
7. Infections: The patient's broad-spectrum antibiotics may not be effective against the underlying infection, which can lead to antibiotic resistance and treatment failure.
8. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest potential kidney damage, which can lead to renal failure if not managed effectively.
9. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest if not managed promptly.
10. Neurological compromise: The patient's altered mental status and potential sepsis may lead to neurological compromise, which can affect her cognitive function and overall prognosis."

   34 y.o. F with Crohn's disease on Imuran and Pentasa with + flu, +
   mycoplasma, now with respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Tachypneic.  CT chest from OSH shows bilateral
   dense infiltrates. Likely cause of dyspnea with contribution from
   reduced lung volumes due to ascites.
   - monitor RR
   - ABGs prn
   - f/u CT chest
   - f/u sputum culture
   - treat pna as above with vanc/zosyn
   - f/u urine legionella
   - likely will need to intubate for transjugular biopsy
   .
   # Acute liver failure: Asterixis on exam, but mental status A&O x 3.
   However, ALT, AST and bilirubin rising in setting of hospitalization.
   Ddx is broad, including shock liver, hepatitis A-C, acetaminophen
   toxicity, autoimmune, ? mycoplasma, hepatosplenic lymphoma
   - appreciate hepatology recs

   - lactulose 30 ml TID for 3 BMs
   - if possible, ophtho consult at bedside for K-F rings
   - transjugular biopsy today
   - therapeutic paracentesis
   .
   # Sepsis: Meets [**3-5**] SIRS criteria and likely source is chest / abdomen
   given OSH chest CT findings.  Also given liver abnormalities, ascites
   on exam, history of Crohn's on immunosuppression, abdominal etiology
   cannot be ruled out.
   - f/u culture (sputum, urine, blood culture)
   - trend lactate
   - IVF boluses to keep MAP > 60, pressors if decompensates
   - vancomycin and zosyn for broad coverage, azithromycin for known
   mycoplasma, flagyl for colitis, ACV for possible HSV
   - confirm flu + with PCP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   34 y.o. F with Crohn's disease on Imuran and Pentasa with + flu, +
   mycoplasma, now with respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Tachypneic.  CT chest from OSH shows bilateral
   dense infiltrates. Likely cause of dyspnea with contribution from
   reduced lung volumes due to ascites.
   - monitor RR
   - ABGs prn
   - f/u CT chest
   - f/u sputum culture
   - treat pna as above with vanc/zosyn
   - f/u urine legionella
   - likely will need to intubate for transjugular biopsy
   .
   # Acute liver failure: Asterixis on exam, but mental status A&O x 3.
   However, ALT, AST and bilirubin rising in setting of hospitalization.
   Ddx is broad, including shock liver, hepatitis A-C, acetaminophen
   toxicity, autoimmune, ? mycoplasma, hepatosplenic lymphoma
   - appreciate hepatology recs
   - trend LFTs, bili, coags q 6 hours
   - monitor FS q 2 hours
   - ABGs prn for decreasing bicarb to assess pH
   - f/u on labs, send-outs
   - f/u CMV PCR
   - consult ID for ? of mycoplasma, flu management around transplant
   surgery
   - consult Heme for possible hepatosplenic lymphoma
   - monitor mental status
   - hold mind-altering medications
   - lactulose 30 ml TID for 3 BMs
   - if possible, ophtho consult at bedside for K-F rings
   - transjugular biopsy today
   - therapeutic paracentesis
   .
   # Sepsis: Meets [**3-5**] SIRS criteria and likely source is chest / abdomen
   given OSH chest CT findings.  Also given liver abnormalities, ascites
   on exam, history of Crohn's on immunosuppression, abdominal etiology
   cannot be ruled out.
   - f/u culture (sputum, urine, blood culture)
   - trend lactate
   - IVF boluses to keep MAP > 60, pressors if decompensates
   - vancomycin and zosyn for broad coverage, azithromycin for known
   mycoplasma, flagyl for colitis, ACV for possible HSV
   - confirm flu + with PCP

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 34-year-old female with Crohn's disease on immunosuppressants who has developed respiratory distress, acute liver failure, sepsis, and anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory Distress:
	* Pneumonia or other infections that can worsen respiratory symptoms
	* Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation
	* Pulmonary embolism or thrombosis
2. Acute Liver Failure:
	* Increased risk of bleeding or coagulopathy
	* Encephalopathy or altered mental status
	* Electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disturbances
	* Increased risk of sepsis or infection
3. Sepsis:
	* Organ dysfunction or failure (e.g., respiratory, cardiovascular, renal)
	* Septic shock or cardiovascular instability
	* Increased risk of bleeding or coagulopathy
	* Increased risk of mortality
4. Anemia:
	* Increased risk of bleeding or hemorrhage
	* Decreased oxygen delivery to tissues
	* Increased risk of cardiovascular complications

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities. The patient has undergone various diagnostic tests, including CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, which revealed bilateral pleural effusion, bilateral airspace opacity, and small pericardial effusion. The patient also has ascites, bowel wall edema, and chronic colitis.

The patient is currently receiving non-invasive ventilation and has been prescribed multiple medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and anticonvulsants. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, and blood pressure of 115/75 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 10.2, hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 197. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 173 IU/L and an alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) level of 7.6 IU/L.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's bilateral airspace opacity on the CT scan, pneumonia is a possible complication.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal liver function tests suggest the possibility of sepsis.
3. Chronic colitis: The patient's diagnosis of chronic colitis may lead to complications such as bleeding, perforation, or stricture formation.
4. Liver failure: The patient's abnormal liver function tests may indicate liver failure, which can lead to complications such as encephalopathy, bleeding, or death.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for non-invasive ventilation and the possibility of pneumonia or sepsis may increase the risk of respiratory failure.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's small pericardial effusion and abnormal liver function tests may increase the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
7. Renal failure: The patient's abnormal liver function tests and the possibility of sepsis may increase the risk of renal failure.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's abnormal liver function tests and the possibility of sepsis may increase the risk of neurological complications such as encephalopathy or seizures.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities and potential complications. Close monitoring and management of the patient's condition are necessary to prevent and treat potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   34 y.o. F with Crohn's disease on Imuran and Pentasa with + flu, +
   mycoplasma, now with respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory Distress: Tachypneic.  CT chest from OSH shows bilateral
   dense infiltrates. Likely cause of dyspnea with contribution from
   reduced lung volumes due to ascites.
   - monitor RR
   - ABGs prn
   - f/u CT chest
   - f/u sputum culture
   - treat pna as above with vanc/zosyn
   - f/u urine legionella
   - therapeutic paracentesis today to see if respiratory distress will be
   relived with it
   - likely will need to intubate for transjugular biopsy
   .
   # Sepsis: Meets [**3-5**] SIRS criteria and likely source is chest / abdomen
   given OSH chest CT findings.  Also given liver abnormalities, ascites
   on exam, history of Crohn's on immunosuppression, abdominal etiology
   cannot be ruled out.
   - f/u culture (sputum, urine, blood culture)
   - trend lactate
   - IVF boluses to keep MAP > 60, pressors if decompensates
   - vancomycin and zosyn for broad coverage, azithromycin for known
   mycoplasma, flagyl for colitis, ACV for possible HSV
   - confirm flu + with PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] droplet precautions
   - f/u CT torso
   .
   # Acute liver failure: Asterixis on exam, but mental status A&O x 3.
   However, ALT, AST and bilirubin rising in setting of hospitalization.
   Ddx is broad, including shock liver, hepatitis A-C, acetaminophen
   toxicity, autoimmune, ? mycoplasma, hepatosplenic lymphoma
   - appreciate hepatology recs
   - trend LFTs, bili, coags q 6 hours
   - monitor FS q 2 hours
   - ABGs prn for decreasing bicarb to assess pH
   - f/u on labs, send-outs
   - f/u CMV PCR
   - consult ID for ? of mycoplasma, flu management around transplant
   surgery
   - consult Heme for possible hepatosplenic lymphoma
   - monitor mental status
   - hold mind-altering medications
   - lactulose 30 ml TID for 3 BMs
   - if possible, ophtho consult at bedside for K-F rings
   - transjugular biopsy today
   - therapeutic paracentesis
   .
   # Crohn's: hold immunosuppressants

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 34-year-old female with Crohn's disease on immunosuppressive therapy who presented with flu-like symptoms, mycoplasma, and respiratory distress. She has bilateral pleural effusion, bilateral airspace opacity, and small pericardial effusion on CT scan. She also has ascites, bowel wall edema, and possible colitis. She is being treated with non-invasive ventilation, antibiotics, and antivirals. She has acute liver failure with rising LFTs and bilirubin, and is at risk for sepsis. She has a history of anemia and is being monitored for electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen due to the bilateral pleural effusion and airspace opacity, and may require intubation for transjugular biopsy.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria and has a likely source of infection in the chest/abdomen, which may lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is deteriorating, and she is at risk for liver failure, which may lead to coagulopathy, bleeding, and encephalopathy.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding and malnutrition, which may lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased tolerance to therapy.
5. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient's electrolyte imbalances may worsen due to ongoing vomiting, diarrhea, and fluid losses, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and seizures.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for secondary infections due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of ascites, which may lead to peritonitis and sepsis.
7. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's liver and kidney function may worsen due to the underlying disease process and the presence of sepsis, which may lead to multi-organ failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue non-invasive ventilation and antibiotics as prescribed.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation for transjugular biopsy if necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's liver function and electrolyte imbalances closely and adjust therapy as necessary.
4. Consider consulting with gastroenterology, hepatology, and infectious disease specialists to optimize therapy and management.
5. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusions if necessary.
6. Consider prophylactic measures to prevent secondary infections, such as antibiotics and antifungals.
7. Monitor the patient's organ function and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent multi-organ failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a critically ill individual with fulminant liver failure, asterixis, and hypoglycemia. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are rising, but the lactate level is trending down. The etiology of the liver failure is unclear, with possible causes including herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatosplenic lymphoma, and superimposed Tylenol toxicity. The patient is being treated with acyclovir and is awaiting further testing, including viral serologies and autoimmune hepatitis serologies.

The patient also has pneumonia, which is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and pancytopenia, which is trending downward. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 10.2, and their platelet count (Plt) is 197.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 38.3°C (101°F)
* Heart rate: 124 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 119/72 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 51 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Heart rhythm: sinus tachycardia

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Well-nourished appearance
* No acute distress
* Anxious
* Diminished breath sounds at the bases of the lungs
* Soft, distended, and tender abdomen
* Right lower extremity edema absent, left lower extremity edema absent
* Warm skin
* Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented, and has purposeful movement and normal tone.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb): 7.9 g/dL
* White blood cell count (WBC): 10.2
* Platelet count (Plt): 197
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 18 mg/dL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.8 mg/dL
* Total bilirubin (T Bili): 8.4 mg/dL
* Alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos): 176 IU/L
* Lactic acid: 5.5 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.0 g/dL
* Calcium (Ca++): 6.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.8 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 2.1 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Further deterioration of liver function, leading to multi-organ failure.
2. Development of sepsis or septic shock due to pneumonia.
3. Hemorrhagic complications due to pancytopenia.
4. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, due to liver failure.
5. Increased risk of bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.
6. Development of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypovolemia or liver failure.
7. Increased risk of respiratory failure due to pneumonia.
8. Development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to liver failure.

Given the patient's critical condition, close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status is essential to prevent and manage potential complications."

   add the following points:
   Her resp status remained severe overnight though she was adequately
   oxygenating and ventilating with the help of BiPAP. The decision was
   made to perform a liver biopsy therefore she was intubated for the
   procedure. She is undergoing the biopsy currently. Her liver function
   has worsened.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Etiology unclear, HSV vs hepatosplenic lymphoma, CT with no evidence of
   [**Male First Name (un) 2717**] chiari, possibly some superimposed tyelnol toxicity but now too far
   out to treat with NAC, other viral serologies pending, autoimmune
   hepatitis serologies. ID consult pending. On Acylcovir. Close
   monitoring of mental status, hypoglycemia, LFTs, bili and coags q6,
   monitor urine output, and lactate, and VBG. Consulting heme for ?
   hepatosplenic lymphoma.
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER:
   plan for elective intubation, prior to IR procedure. Continue broad
   spectrum antibiotics with vanco/zosyn/flagyl. Holding all
   immunesuppressants.
 Fever: pancultured on broadspectrum antiobitics
 Pancytopenia: continue to trend, ? related to viral process, vs
   lymphoma, vs immuran effect vs other.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Her resp status remained severe overnight though she was adequately
   oxygenating and ventilating with the help of BiPAP. The decision was
   made to perform a liver biopsy therefore she was intubated for the
   procedure. She is undergoing the biopsy currently. Her liver function
   has worsened.
   Exam: T103, HR 119, 90/50, 99% AC 12/550/0.8/5
   Intubated, sedated
   Neck supple
   Hrt tachy
   Lung clear anteriorly
   Abd benign
   Extreme no edema
   Labs reviewed and recorded above
   Imaging: CXR reviewed, ETT ok, scattered infiltrates
   Problems: resp failure, pna, flu, liver failure, ? Crohn
s flare,
   pancytopenia
   Agree with plan to continue vent support, cont antibiotics, ID to weigh
   in, liver biopsy, bone marrow biopsy
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill.
   Total time: 41 min
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 103**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 104**], MD
   on:[**2194-9-19**] 16:16 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with fulminant liver failure, pneumonia, and pancytopenia. The patient was admitted with a chief complaint of fulminant liver failure and has been receiving treatment for the same. The patient's liver function has worsened, and the patient is currently undergoing a liver biopsy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure can lead to the accumulation of toxins in the blood, which can cause encephalopathy, a life-threatening condition.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and pancytopenia can increase the risk of sepsis, a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ failure.
3. Bleeding: The patient's pancytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding, which can be life-threatening.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system can increase the risk of infection, which can be life-threatening.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia can lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension can increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
7. Kidney failure: The patient's liver failure can lead to kidney failure, which can be life-threatening.
8. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancytopenia can increase the risk of pancreatitis, a life-threatening condition.

The patient's treatment plan includes continued ventilation support, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and ID consultation. The patient is also undergoing a liver biopsy and bone marrow biopsy to determine the etiology of the liver failure and pancytopenia. The patient's condition is critically ill, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent complications and improve outcomes."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - ID consulted and added on VZV, adenovirus PCR, urine legionella,
   rimantidine 100mg QD, stool enterovirus these were ordered. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   is working on getting mycoplasma PCR. Also advised that Husband, Mother
   and baby should get prophylaxis. If CXR blossoms should consider
   disseminated PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Hepatology saw pt. and pt. went for transjugular Liver Bx which was
   nonspecific on initial touch prep, did not show lymphoma. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] was
   very concerned for hepatosplenic lymphoma which would be the only
   indication that would not require transplant. Plan is to check final
   liver Bx and if negative get BM biopsy, heme has already been consulted
   and thinks lymphoma unlikely.
   - Trended Q6 LFTs and Coags, coags worsened but bili/AST trended down.
   - Became progressively hypoglycemic to 44 and started D5NS at 100cc/hr
   - Had CVL placed with Liver Bx.
   - UOP remained about 30cc/hr
   - PM lytes showed acute renal failure, stable bicarb
   - Peripheral flow cytometry was sent
   - CT head negative
   - Ophtho consulted and did bedside exam w/ no [**Location (un) 8953**]-Fleischer rings,
   but mild blurring of optic disc w/ hemorrage on disc so got neuro
   consult for management of increased ICP. They recommended MRV to check
   for venous sinus thrombosis.
   - Lactate remained stable
   - Transplant surgery recommended transfer to their service, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**]
   mostly in agreement will need to be discussed in am.
   - Verbally confirmed w/ PCP influenza [**Name Initial (PRE) **] + on [**9-9**].
   - Hct dropped from 25->21 but hepatology recommended against giving her
   products to avoid alloimmunization.
   - PTT trended up to >150
   - FYI'd Nsurg that we may need a bolt for ICP monitoring\
   - After long discussion with transplant surgery, neurology and liver
   fellow decided not to place bolt for intracranial monitoring.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   nonspecific on initial touch prep, did not show lymphoma. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] was
   very concerned for hepatosplenic lymphoma which would be the only
   indication that would not require transplant. Plan is to check final
   liver Bx and if negative get BM biopsy, heme has already been consulted
   and thinks lymphoma unlikely.
   - Trended Q6 LFTs and Coags, coags worsened but bili/AST trended down.
   - Became progressively hypoglycemic to 44 and started D5NS at 100cc/hr
   - Had CVL placed with Liver Bx.
   - UOP remained about 30cc/hr
   - PM lytes showed acute renal failure, stable bicarb
   - Peripheral flow cytometry was sent
   - CT head negative
   - Ophtho consulted and did bedside exam w/ no [**Location (un) 8953**]-Fleischer rings,
   but mild blurring of optic disc w/ hemorrage on disc so got neuro
   consult for management of increased ICP. They recommended MRV to check
   for venous sinus thrombosis.
   - Lactate remained stable
   - Transplant surgery recommended transfer to their service, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**]
   mostly in agreement will need to be discussed in am.
   - Verbally confirmed w/ PCP influenza [**Name Initial (PRE) **] + on [**9-9**].
   - Hct dropped from 25->21 but hepatology recommended against giving her
   products to avoid alloimmunization.
   - PTT trended up to >150
   - FYI'd Nsurg that we may need a bolt for ICP monitoring\
   - After long discussion with transplant surgery, neurology and liver
   fellow decided not to place bolt for intracranial monitoring.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 34-year-old female with Crohn's disease on immunosuppressive therapy who presented with respiratory distress, acute liver failure, and sepsis. The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's bilirubin and liver function tests (LFTs) have stabilized, but the risk of hepatic encephalopathy remains due to the patient's acute liver failure.
2. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP): The patient's mental status is deteriorating, and the neurology team is concerned about the risk of increased ICP. A bolt for ICP monitoring was considered but ultimately not placed.
3. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria and has a likely source of sepsis in the chest or abdomen. The patient is at risk of developing septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation, but the risk of respiratory failure remains due to her underlying lung disease and potential for further lung injury.
5. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and the risk of further renal dysfunction is high.
6. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, and the risk of bleeding is high, especially in the context of her underlying liver disease and immunosuppressive therapy.
7. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing further infections due to her immunosuppressive therapy and underlying disease.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Close monitoring of her vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
2. Monitoring of her liver function tests, bilirubin, and coagulation studies.
3. Management of her sepsis with antibiotics and fluids.
4. Monitoring of her respiratory status and adjusting her mechanical ventilation settings as needed.
5. Monitoring of her renal function and adjusting her fluid management and electrolyte replacement as needed.
6. Monitoring of her bleeding risk and adjusting her anticoagulation therapy as needed.
7. Close communication with the patient's family and healthcare team to ensure that all parties are aware of the patient's condition and plan of care.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management in the intensive care unit (ICU) to address her complex medical condition and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - ID consulted and added on VZV, adenovirus PCR, urine legionella,
   rimantidine 100mg QD, stool enterovirus these were ordered. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   is working on getting mycoplasma PCR. Also advised that Husband, Mother
   and baby should get prophylaxis. If CXR blossoms should consider
   disseminated PCP.
   [**Name Initial (NameIs) **] Hepatology saw pt. and pt. went for transjugular Liver Bx which was
   nonspecific on initial touch prep, did not show lymphoma. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**] was
   very concerned for hepatosplenic lymphoma which would be the only
   indication that would not require transplant. Plan is to check final
   liver Bx and if negative get BM biopsy, heme has already been consulted
   and thinks lymphoma unlikely.
   - Trended Q6 LFTs and Coags, coags worsened but bili/AST trended down.
   - Became progressively hypoglycemic to 44 and started D5NS at 100cc/hr
   - Had CVL placed with Liver Bx.
   - UOP remained about 30cc/hr
   - PM lytes showed acute renal failure, stable bicarb
   - Peripheral flow cytometry was sent
   - CT head negative
   - Ophtho consulted and did bedside exam w/ no [**Location (un) 8953**]-Fleischer rings,
   but mild blurring of optic disc w/ hemorrage on disc so got neuro
   consult for management of increased ICP. They recommended MRV to check
   for venous sinus thrombosis.
   - Lactate remained stable
   - Transplant surgery recommended transfer to their service, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 356**]
   mostly in agreement will need to be discussed in am.
   - Verbally confirmed w/ PCP influenza [**Name Initial (PRE) **] + on [**9-9**].
   - Hct dropped from 25->21 but hepatology recommended against giving her
   products to avoid alloimmunization.
   - PTT trended up to >150
   - FYI'd Nsurg that we may need a bolt for ICP monitoring\
   - After long discussion with transplant surgery, neurology and liver
   fellow decided not to place bolt for intracranial monitoring.

Summary:

The patient is a 34-year-old female with Crohn's disease, who was admitted with respiratory distress, acute liver failure, and sepsis. She has a history of immunosuppression and is currently intubated. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with worsening coagulopathy, acute renal failure, and hypoglycemia. She has also developed papilledema and is at risk for increased intracranial pressure.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and acute renal failure. She has also tested positive for influenza, mycoplasma, and legionella. The preliminary liver biopsy was negative for lymphoma.

The patient's plan includes:

* Transfer to the transplant surgery service
* Albumin infusion
* Monitoring of liver function tests, bilirubin, and coagulation parameters
* Trending of lactate levels
* Monitoring of fluid status and electrolyte balance
* Consideration of midodrine and octreotide for management of ascites
* Limiting sedation and monitoring of mental status
* Lactulose therapy for bowel management

Potential medical complications:

1. Increased intracranial pressure: The patient's papilledema and risk of elevated ICP require close monitoring and management.
2. Sepsis: The patient's SIRS criteria and likely source of infection from the chest or abdomen require prompt treatment and monitoring.
3. Acute liver failure: The patient's liver function tests and coagulopathy indicate worsening liver failure, which requires close monitoring and management.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function tests and electrolyte imbalance indicate worsening renal failure, which requires close monitoring and management.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia requires close monitoring and management.
6. Immunosuppression: The patient's history of immunosuppression and current treatment with immunosuppressive medications require close monitoring for opportunistic infections.
7. Infection: The patient's positive tests for influenza, mycoplasma, and legionella require prompt treatment and monitoring.
8. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and risk of bleeding require close monitoring and management.

Recommendations:

1. Transfer the patient to the transplant surgery service for further management and care.
2. Continue monitoring the patient's liver function tests, bilirubin, and coagulation parameters.
3. Trend lactate levels and monitor fluid status and electrolyte balance.
4. Limit sedation and monitor mental status.
5. Consider midodrine and octreotide for management of ascites.
6. Monitor for signs of bleeding and take appropriate measures to prevent bleeding.
7. Continue treatment for sepsis and infection.
8. Monitor for signs of increased intracranial pressure and take appropriate measures to manage it."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 34-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with hepatic failure, respiratory failure, and signs of increased intracranial pressure. She is intubated and sedated. The patient has a history of a viral illness, superimposed atypical pneumonia, and is listed for liver transplant. She has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungals.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 103.3°F (39.6°C)
* Heart rate: 134 bpm
* Blood pressure: 115/61 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 33 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.4-8.5 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 7.1-7.7 g/dL
* Platelet count: 154-178 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.8-1.2 mg/dL
* Glucose: 37-78 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 6.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.6 g/dL
* LDH: 2122 IU/L
* Calcium: 6.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 3.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.0 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure may lead to encephalopathy, which can cause confusion, disorientation, and altered mental status.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and laboratory results suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating possible renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are fluctuating, and she may be at risk for hypoglycemia, which can cause neurological symptoms and even coma.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's liver failure may lead to coagulopathy, which can cause bleeding and thrombosis.
7. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and immunosuppression may increase her risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's liver failure may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which can cause hypovolemic shock and acidosis.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's liver failure may lead to electrolyte imbalances, which can cause muscle weakness, cramping, and cardiac arrhythmias.
10. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's liver failure may lead to cardiovascular instability, which can cause hypotension, tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias."
