   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Shock: Hypovolemic vs Septic shock given history of profuse diarrhea
   and grossly positive UA. Pressure not responsive to fluids arguing
   against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension. Also s/p 2U PRBCs in
   ED. Afebrile, with chronically elevated WBC arguing against sepsis but
   she is on max dose levophed with MAPS of 55-60. [**Month (only) 8**] be obstructive (ie
   PE) but not tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and
   satting well on RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Continue boluses with goal CVP 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60
   - Treat with empiric antibiotics
   - Place A-line
   - Ck SV02 and consider PRBCs if less than 70
   - ECHO in AM to R/O PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Recent XRT and may be radiation colitis.
   - send stool cx, o and p, c diff
   - start PO flagyl
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks.
   No bands. Difficult to determine if this is secondary to infection or
   malignancy. CT abd/pelvis (w/o contrast) did not show evidence of
   inflammation/abscess. UA with >50WBCs concerning for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue empiric antibiotics with flagyl and ceftriaxone
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**]. Now with
   ARF in setting of hypotension. Prerenal vs. ATN.
   - Ck urine lytes
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer. She was admitted to the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains bradycardic and hypotensive. She has a large presacral pelvic mass eroding the sacrum, which is not clearly related to the bowel. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and creatinine, as well as an anion gap acidosis. She has a DNR/DNI code status and is being treated with empiric antibiotics, vasopressors, and fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and positive urine culture suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not managed properly.
3. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis may worsen if not treated with bicarbonate.
4. Hypovolemic Shock: The patient's hypovolemic shock may worsen if not managed properly.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she may be at risk for respiratory failure if her underlying lung disease worsens.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's diarrhea and acute worsening of chronic diarrhea may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and malnutrition.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia may lead to cardiovascular complications such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
8. Infection: The patient's positive urine culture and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infection, which may lead to sepsis or organ failure.
9. Malignancy: The patient's metastatic cervical cancer may progress and cause further complications, such as bleeding or bowel obstruction.
10. Malnutrition: The patient's NPO status and acute worsening of chronic diarrhea may lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalance."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-inch tall individual with a 36.4°C (97.6°F) temperature, bradycardia (53 bpm), and hypotension (94/43 mmHg). They have a sinus bradycardia rhythm and require maximum doses of norepinephrine and phenylephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure. Glucagon was given with marked improvement in pressures. The patient has a large presacral pelvic mass eroding the sacrum, which is unable to be fully assessed due to lack of contrast. They have a history of allergies to Zocor and Flagyl, and have received antibiotics, including vancomycin. The patient's vital signs and laboratory results are as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.4°C (97.6°F), Tcurrent 36.4°C (97.6°F), HR 53 bpm, BP 94/43 mmHg, RR 11 inspirations per minute, SpO2 75%, and heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia.
* Laboratory results: WBC 35.1, Hct 30.3, Plt 195, Cr 4.1, TropT 0.05, TCO2 14, Glucose 150, and other labs as listed.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications: Bradycardia and hypotension may lead to cardiac arrest or cardiac failure.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to hypoxia or respiratory failure.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status may deteriorate due to hypoxia, hypotension, or other underlying conditions.
4. Infectious complications: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to underlying conditions, leading to infections such as sepsis or pneumonia.
5. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hemodynamic status may deteriorate due to hypotension, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
6. Nutritional complications: The patient may experience malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances due to inadequate nutrition or gastrointestinal dysfunction.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient may experience gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction due to the large presacral pelvic mass.
8. Venous thromboembolic complications: The patient may develop deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and underlying conditions.
9. Stress ulcer complications: The patient may develop stress ulcers due to critical illness and underlying conditions.
10. VAP complications: The patient may develop ventilator-associated pneumonia due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and underlying conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to IVF, 2U
   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension. She has
   remained afebrile, with chronically elevated WBC so difficult to say it
   is response to infection. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to glucagon, her
   hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol however this is not
   the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive (ie PE) but not
   tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and satting well on
   RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Continue IVF boluses with goal CVP 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60
   - Continue empiric antibiotic, at least until C.diff ctx return
   - Transfuse
   - ECHO in AM to R/O PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Recent XRT and may be radiation colitis.
   - send stool cx, o and p, c diff
   - start PO flagyl
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks.
   No bands. Difficult to determine if this is secondary to infection or
   malignancy. CT abd/pelvis (w/o contrast) did not show evidence of
   inflammation/abscess. UA with >50WBCs concerning for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue empiric antibiotics with flagyl and ceftriaxone
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. Prerenal vs. ATN. Urine lytes support this diagnosis.
   -IVF boluses as above
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as

   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to IVF, 2U
   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension. She has
   remained afebrile, with chronically elevated WBC so difficult to say it
   is response to infection. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to glucagon, her
   hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol however this is not
   the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive (ie PE) but not
   tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and satting well on
   RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Continue IVF boluses with goal CVP 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60
   - Continue empiric antibiotic, at least until C.diff ctx return

   - send stool cx, o and p, c diff
   - start PO flagyl
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff

   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks.
   No bands. Difficult to determine if this is secondary to infection or
   malignancy. CT abd/pelvis (w/o contrast) did not show evidence of
   inflammation/abscess. UA with >50WBCs concerning for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue empiric antibiotics with flagyl and ceftriaxone
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer, admitted to the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. She has been treated with maximum doses of norepinephrine and phenylephrine, with little improvement in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Glucagon was given, which resulted in marked improvement in pressures. The patient has remained bradycardic and hypotensive, with a MAP of 55-60. She has also been diagnosed with acute worsening of chronic diarrhea, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, anion gap acidosis, and cervical cancer with sacral metastases.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: Given the patient's history of profuse diarrhea and grossly positive urine analysis, septic shock is a possibility.
2. Obstructive shock: Although the patient's EKG does not show evidence of right heart strain, obstructive shock cannot be ruled out.
3. Radiation colitis: The patient's recent XRT may have caused radiation colitis, which could be contributing to her diarrhea and acute worsening of chronic diarrhea.
4. C. difficile infection: The patient's history of C. diff requiring PO flagyl and the recent antibiotics may have led to a C. diff infection.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI)/urosepsis: The patient's urine analysis with >50 WBCs is concerning for UTI/urosepsis.
6. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's acute renal failure may be secondary to ATN.
7. Anion gap acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis may be secondary to elevated lactate, renal failure, and diarrhea.
8. Hypovolemic shock: Although the patient's BP was not responsive to IVF, hypovolemic shock cannot be ruled out.
9. Cervical cancer progression: The patient's cervical cancer with sacral metastases may be progressing, which could affect her overall prognosis.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, lab results, and clinical status closely. Further evaluation and management of her diarrhea, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and anion gap acidosis are necessary. Additionally, the patient's cervical cancer and sacral metastases require ongoing management and monitoring."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to IVF, 2U
   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension. She has
   remained afebrile, with chronically elevated WBC so difficult to say it
   is response to infection. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to glucagon, her
   hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol however this is not
   the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive (ie PE) but not
   tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and satting well on
   RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Continue IVF boluses with goal CVP 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60
   - Continue empiric antibiotic, at least until C.diff ctx return
   - Transfuse
   - ECHO in AM to R/O PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Recent XRT and may be radiation colitis.
   - send stool cx, o and p, c diff
   - start PO flagyl
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks.
   No bands. Difficult to determine if this is secondary to infection or
   malignancy. CT abd/pelvis (w/o contrast) did not show evidence of
   inflammation/abscess. UA with >50WBCs concerning for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue empiric antibiotics with flagyl and ceftriaxone
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. Prerenal vs. ATN. Urine lytes support this diagnosis.
   -IVF boluses as above
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer. She is currently in shock, with a blood pressure of 94/43 mmHg and a heart rate of 53 beats per minute. She is also experiencing diarrhea, acute renal failure, and anion gap acidosis.

The patient was initially treated with norepinephrine and phenylephrine, but her blood pressure remained low. Glucagon was then added, which resulted in an improvement in her blood pressure. The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) shows sinus bradycardia, and her oxygen saturation is 75%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate levels, and creatinine levels. Her urine output is decreased, and she has a high anion gap.

The patient's diagnosis is complex, and it is difficult to determine the primary cause of her shock. The patient's history of profuse diarrhea and grossly positive urine analysis suggests that she may have septic shock, but her lack of fever and chronically elevated white blood cell count make it difficult to confirm this diagnosis. The patient's response to glucagon suggests that she may have had a beta-blocker-induced bradycardia, but this is not the only factor contributing to her hypotension.

The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to a combination of factors, including hypotension, dehydration, and potential obstruction of the urinary tract. Her anion gap acidosis is likely secondary to elevated lactate levels and renal failure.

The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, diabetes, and metastatic cancer. She is currently on a number of medications, including insulin, metformin, and atenolol.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing IV fluids, antibiotics, and pressors to support her blood pressure. She will also be monitored for signs of infection and sepsis. The patient's electrolyte levels will be closely monitored, and she will receive IV fluids with bicarbonate to help manage her acidosis.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further deterioration of the patient's renal function
* Development of septic shock
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Infection
* Sepsis
* Metabolic acidosis

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to IVF, 2U
   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension, although
   it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but rising
   WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however clinically this
   does not appear to be the case as she seems very comfortable on exam.
   Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered given hypotension, low
   voltage EKG and cool extremities on presentation. She was on max dose
   levophed and phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to
   glucagon, her hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol
   however this is not the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive
   (ie PE) but not tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and
   satting well on RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Can decrease IVF as maintaining goal CVP of 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60, stop glucagon drip
   - f/u blood, stool cultures
   -? Need for antibiotics today as pt has no diarrhea and is afebrile
   - Transfuse for hct< 27
   - ECHO in AM to r/o PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Patient also noted that she is allergic to flagyl, which
   gives her diarrhea. Unclear whether this is truly infectious vs.
   radiation colitis given recently completed treatment. Lastly,
   malignancy may be progressing and involving her bowel, causing
   worsening diarrhea.
   - send stool Cx, O&P, Cdiff
   -consider PO vancomycin if pt cannot tolerate flagyl, otherwise would
   d/c antibiotics unless cx positive
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   -if possible repeat imaging w/contrast
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. Pre-renal vs. ATN. Urine lytes, FeNa 0.6% support
   pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**] fluid losses. Low bicarbonate treated
   with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which is likely reason for hyponatremia this
   morning. This metabolic acidosis is likely d/t GI losses. Would switch
   to IV NS today.
   -IVF boluses as above
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
   -          onc recs

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to IVF, 2U
   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension, although
   it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but rising
   WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however clinically this
   does not appear to be the case as she seems very comfortable on exam.
   Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered given hypotension, low
   voltage EKG and cool extremities on presentation. She was on max dose
   levophed and phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to
   glucagon, her hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol
   however this is not the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive
   (ie PE) but not tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and
   satting well on RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Can decrease IVF as maintaining goal CVP of 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60, stop glucagon drip
   - f/u blood, stool cultures
   -? Need for antibiotics today as pt has no diarrhea and is afebrile
   - Transfuse for hct< 27
   - ECHO in AM to r/o PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Patient also noted that she is allergic to flagyl, which
   gives her diarrhea. Unclear whether this is truly infectious vs.
   radiation colitis given recently completed treatment. Lastly,
   malignancy may be progressing and involving her bowel, causing
   worsening diarrhea.
   - send stool Cx, O&P, Cdiff
   -consider PO vancomycin if pt cannot tolerate flagyl, otherwise would
   d/c antibiotics unless cx positive
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   -if possible repeat imaging w/contrast
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. Pre-renal vs. ATN. Urine lytes, FeNa 0.6% support
   pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**] fluid losses. Low bicarbonate treated
   with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which is likely reason for hyponatremia this
   morning. This metabolic acidosis is likely d/t GI losses. Would switch
   to IV NS today.
   -IVF boluses as above
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
   -          onc recs
   -          CT repeat if stable
   .
   DM: hyperglycemia is secondary to glucagon which is ok to stop now.
   Adjust SSI as needed.
   - FS QID
   - ISS
   .
   HTN: holding meds while on pressors
   .

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary can be drawn:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer, who presented with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. She has been treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and glucagon, and has shown improvement in her blood pressure and heart rate. However, she remains critically ill with ongoing diarrhea, acute renal failure, and anion gap acidosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's rising WBC count and hypotension suggest the possibility of septic shock, which could worsen her condition if not addressed promptly.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly, which could lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances and anemia.
3. Anion gap acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis may worsen if not managed with proper electrolyte replacement and correction of underlying causes, which could lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
4. Cervical cancer progression: The patient's known sacral metastases may indicate progression of her cervical cancer, which could worsen her overall prognosis and quality of life.
5. Infection: The patient's diarrhea and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of infection, which could worsen her condition if not addressed promptly.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's ongoing hypotension and bradycardia may indicate ongoing hemodynamic instability, which could worsen her condition if not managed properly.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's ongoing diarrhea and anorexia may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which could worsen her condition if not managed properly.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care team should consider the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to identify any changes or trends that may indicate worsening of her condition.
2. Adjust the patient's antibiotic therapy as necessary to address any potential infections.
3. Manage the patient's acute renal failure with proper fluid management and electrolyte replacement.
4. Correct the patient's anion gap acidosis with proper electrolyte replacement and correction of underlying causes.
5. Consider repeat imaging studies to assess the patient's cervical cancer and potential progression.
6. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and provide appropriate nutritional support to prevent deficiencies.
7. Continue to provide hemodynamic support as necessary to maintain the patient's blood pressure and cardiac output."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to IVF, 2U
   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension. She has
   remained afebrile, with chronically elevated WBC so difficult to say it
   is response to infection. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to glucagon, her
   hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol however this is not
   the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive (ie PE) but not
   tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and satting well on
   RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Continue IVF boluses with goal CVP 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60
   - Continue empiric antibiotic, at least until C.diff ctx return
   - Transfuse
   - ECHO in AM to R/O PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Recent XRT and may be radiation colitis.
   - send stool cx, o and p, c diff
   - start PO flagyl
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks.
   No bands. Difficult to determine if this is secondary to infection or
   malignancy. CT abd/pelvis (w/o contrast) did not show evidence of
   inflammation/abscess. UA with >50WBCs concerning for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue empiric antibiotics with flagyl and ceftriaxone
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. Prerenal vs. ATN. Urine lytes support this diagnosis.
   -IVF boluses as above
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer, admitted to the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. She has been treated with norepinephrine and phenylephrine for hypotension, and glucagon was given with marked improvement in pressures. She has also been diagnosed with chronic diarrhea and leukocytosis, and is being treated empirically for UTI/urosepsis and C. difficile colitis. Her acute renal failure is suspected to be prerenal in origin, and she is being treated with IV fluids and antibiotics. She has an anion gap acidosis and is being managed with IV fluids with bicarbonate.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: Given the patient's history of profuse diarrhea and grossly positive urine analysis, it is possible that she may be developing septic shock due to a urinary tract infection or urosepsis.
2. Obstructive shock: Although the patient does not have evidence of right heart strain on EKG, it is possible that she may have an obstructive shock due to a pulmonary embolism (PE).
3. Radiation colitis: The patient's recent radiation therapy may be contributing to her diarrhea and acute worsening of chronic diarrhea.
4. C. difficile colitis: The patient's diarrhea may be due to C. difficile colitis, which is a potential complication of antibiotics and chemotherapy.
5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to acute kidney injury if not managed properly.
6. Anion gap acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis may worsen if not managed properly with IV fluids and bicarbonate.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's diarrhea and acute renal failure may lead to electrolyte imbalances, which can worsen her condition if not managed properly.
8. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and positive urine analysis suggest that she may have an underlying infection, which needs to be further evaluated and treated.
9. Malignancy: The patient's metastatic cervical cancer and NSCLC may be contributing to her symptoms and worsening condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a complex medical history, including stage III non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic cervical cancer. She is currently in the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 56 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 101/38 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 87% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 35.1-36.0 K/uL
* Hct: 30.0-32.0%
* Plt: 132-195 K/uL
* Cr: 3.9-4.2 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.05 ng/mL
* TCO2: 14-19 mmHg
* Glucose: 150-331 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is limited due to her critical condition, but she appears to be responding to stimuli and has a normal left ventricular size and function on echocardiogram. Her right ventricle is dilated, mildly hypokinetic, and has elevated estimated pulmonary artery pressure, with moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including vasopressors, antibiotics, and heparin. She is also receiving nutrition and glycemic control measures.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to her diarrhea and cloudy urine
* Acute kidney injury due to her acute renal failure
* Respiratory failure due to her hypoxia and elevated pulmonary artery pressure
* Cardiac failure due to her right ventricular dysfunction and tricuspid regurgitation
* Metabolic complications due to her electrolyte imbalances and glucose fluctuations
* Infection due to her indwelling catheters and lines
* Venous thromboembolism due to her immobility and risk factors

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   CT scan without contrast
   1. Relatively stable appearance of the large presacral soft tissue mass
   with
   destruction of the left sacrum. The involvement of the colon with the
   tumor
   is impossible to assess in absence of oral or IV contrast.
   2. Interval increase in size and number of multiple pulmonary nodules,
   consistent with worsening of metastatic disease.
   Chest x-ray this morning: no official read however appears definitely
   volume up with increasing pulmonary vascular congestion and obscuration
   of right costophrenic angle.
   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea, although of note, now patient currently denies having any
   diarrhea at home, and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to
   IVF, 2U PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension,
   although it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider PE
   high on the differential. Also on the differential diagnosis is right
   heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the setting of what
   appears to be bradycardia.  Also now with evidence of fluid overload on
   exam.
   - wean phenylephrine off, in terms of choosing pressors would likely
   pick dopamine for chronotropic as well as ionotropic effects if unable
   to wean off current pressors right now
   - cultures are still all pending
 cont ceftriaxone, flagyl for now
   (flagyl with history of c. diff) ceftriaxone for dirty UA
   - V/Q to look for evidence of PE given that cannot get CTA given renal
   failure
   - if V/Q scan positive, would get head CT prior to initiation of
   anti-coagulation in the setting of metastatic disease and no recent
   head imaging (again would have to be non-constrast)
   - consider right heart EKG to look for evidence of right heart ischemia
   - send stool culture
   - send sputum culture
   - consider repeat UA/ucx
   .
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. FeNa initially 0.6% support pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**]
   fluid losses however repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   may be contributing to hyponatreamia.
   Hyponatremia: Suspect that hypervolemic hyponatremia. Got 20 IV lasix
   today. Will hold off on additional fluids at this time. Will check
   urine osm, urine lytes and serum osms
   - fluid restriction as needed
   - will continue to follow-lytes
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
    - onc recs
   - CT repeat as above
   .
   Diabetes:
   - FS QID
   - ISS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   1. Relatively stable appearance of the large presacral soft tissue mass
   with
   destruction of the left sacrum. The involvement of the colon with the
   tumor
   is impossible to assess in absence of oral or IV contrast.
   2. Interval increase in size and number of multiple pulmonary nodules,
   consistent with worsening of metastatic disease.
   Chest x-ray this morning: no official read however appears definitely
   volume up with increasing pulmonary vascular congestion and obscuration
   of right costophrenic angle.
   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea, although of note, now patient currently denies having any
   diarrhea at home, and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to
   IVF, 2U PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension,
   although it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider PE
   high on the differential. Also on the differential diagnosis is right
   heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the setting of what
   appears to be bradycardia.  Also now with evidence of fluid overload on
   exam.
   - wean phenylephrine off, in terms of choosing pressors would likely
   pick dopamine for chronotropic as well as ionotropic effects if unable
   to wean off current pressors right now
   - cultures are still all pending
 cont ceftriaxone, flagyl for now
   (flagyl with history of c. diff) ceftriaxone for dirty UA
   - V/Q to look for evidence of PE given that cannot get CTA given renal
   failure
   - if V/Q scan positive, would get head CT prior to initiation of
   anti-coagulation in the setting of metastatic disease and no recent
   head imaging (again would have to be non-constrast)
   - consider right heart EKG to look for evidence of right heart ischemia
   - send stool culture
   - send sputum culture
   - consider repeat UA/ucx
   .
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. FeNa initially 0.6% support pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**]
   fluid losses however repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   may be contributing to hyponatreamia.
   Hyponatremia: Suspect that hypervolemic hyponatremia. Got 20 IV lasix
   today. Will hold off on additional fluids at this time. Will check
   urine osm, urine lytes and serum osms
   - fluid restriction as needed
   - will continue to follow-lytes
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer, admitted to the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. She has a dilated right ventricle with elevated pulmonary artery pressures and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation on echocardiogram. Her blood pressure is labile, and she is receiving two pressors, norepinephrine and phenylephrine. Her urine output is decreased, and she has a cloudy and dirty urine sample. She has a fever of 36.6°C (97.8°F) and a heart rate of 56 beats per minute. Her respiratory support includes oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, and her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.29, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 35 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 95 mmHg.

Potential medical complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's rising white blood cell count, hypotension, and lack of fever argue against septic shock, but it cannot be ruled out entirely.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's hypotension, low voltage electrocardiogram (EKG), and dilated right ventricle with elevated pulmonary artery pressures on echocardiogram suggest cardiogenic shock.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's echocardiogram shows a dilated right ventricle, and her chest x-ray shows volume overload and increasing pulmonary vascular congestion, which may indicate a PE.
4. Right heart infarct: The patient's right ventricular hypokinesis and elevated pulmonary artery pressures on echocardiogram suggest a right heart infarct.
5. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's repeat FeNa of 2.3% suggests a component of ATN in addition to pre-renal etiology.
6. Anion gap acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate and renal failure may contribute to an anion gap acidosis.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's hypervolemic hyponatremia may be due to fluid overload, and her serum osmolality should be rechecked.
8. Leukocytosis: The patient's chronically elevated white blood cell count may be secondary to infection or malignancy, and a repeat urine culture and stool culture are recommended.
9. UTI/urosepsis: The patient's urine output is decreased, and her urine sample is cloudy and dirty, which may indicate a UTI/urosepsis.
10. Cervical cancer/NSCLC: The patient's known sacral metastases and cervical cancer require further evaluation and management, including contact with oncology and repeat CT imaging if stable."

   1. Relatively stable appearance of the large presacral soft tissue mass
   with
   destruction of the left sacrum. The involvement of the colon with the
   tumor
   is impossible to assess in absence of oral or IV contrast.
   2. Interval increase in size and number of multiple pulmonary nodules,
   consistent with worsening of metastatic disease.
   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to IVF, 2U
   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension, although
   it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but rising
   WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however clinically this
   does not appear to be the case as she seems very comfortable on exam.
   Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered given hypotension, low
   voltage EKG and cool extremities on presentation. She was on max dose
   levophed and phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to
   glucagon, her hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol
   however this is not the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive
   (ie PE) but not tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and
   satting well on RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Can decrease IVF as maintaining goal CVP of 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60, stop glucagon drip
   - f/u blood, stool cultures
   -? Need for antibiotics today as pt has no diarrhea and is afebrile
   - Transfuse for hct< 27
   - ECHO in AM to r/o PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Patient also noted that she is allergic to flagyl, which
   gives her diarrhea. Unclear whether this is truly infectious vs.
   radiation colitis given recently completed treatment. Lastly,
   malignancy may be progressing and involving her bowel, causing
   worsening diarrhea.
   - send stool Cx, O&P, Cdiff
   -consider PO vancomycin if pt cannot tolerate flagyl, otherwise would
   d/c antibiotics unless cx positive
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   -if possible repeat imaging w/contrast
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. Pre-renal vs. ATN. Urine lytes, FeNa 0.6% support
   pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**] fluid losses. Low bicarbonate treated
   with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which is likely reason for hyponatremia this
   morning. This metabolic acidosis is likely d/t GI losses. Would switch
   to IV NS today.
   -IVF boluses as above
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
   -          onc recs
   -          CT repeat if stable
   .
   DM: hyperglycemia is secondary to glucagon which is ok to stop now.
   Adjust SSI as needed.
   - FS QID

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   destruction of the left sacrum. The involvement of the colon with the
   tumor
   is impossible to assess in absence of oral or IV contrast.
   2. Interval increase in size and number of multiple pulmonary nodules,
   consistent with worsening of metastatic disease.
   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to IVF, 2U
   PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension, although
   it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but rising
   WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however clinically this
   does not appear to be the case as she seems very comfortable on exam.
   Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered given hypotension, low
   voltage EKG and cool extremities on presentation. She was on max dose
   levophed and phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given response to
   glucagon, her hypotension/bradycardia was partly due to atenolol
   however this is not the complete picture. Unlikely to be obstructive
   (ie PE) but not tachycardic, no evidence of R heart strain on EKG and
   satting well on RA. No chest pain and friction rub on exam.
   - Can decrease IVF as maintaining goal CVP of 12
   - Continue levophed for MAP >60, stop glucagon drip
   - f/u blood, stool cultures
   -? Need for antibiotics today as pt has no diarrhea and is afebrile
   - Transfuse for hct< 27
   - ECHO in AM to r/o PE
   .
   Diarrhea: Acute worsening of chronic diarrhea. History of C. diff
   requiring PO flagyl though no recent antibiotics to support this
   diagnosis. Patient also noted that she is allergic to flagyl, which
   gives her diarrhea. Unclear whether this is truly infectious vs.
   radiation colitis given recently completed treatment. Lastly,
   malignancy may be progressing and involving her bowel, causing
   worsening diarrhea.
   - send stool Cx, O&P, Cdiff
   -consider PO vancomycin if pt cannot tolerate flagyl, otherwise would
   d/c antibiotics unless cx positive
   - No lomitil until ruled out for c diff
   -if possible repeat imaging w/contrast
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. Pre-renal vs. ATN. Urine lytes, FeNa 0.6% support
   pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**] fluid losses. Low bicarbonate treated
   with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which is likely reason for hyponatremia this
   morning. This metabolic acidosis is likely d/t GI losses. Would switch
   to IV NS today.
   -IVF boluses as above
   - monitor BUN/CR and lytes
   - maintain MAP >60
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
   -          onc recs
   -          CT repeat if stable
   .
   DM: hyperglycemia is secondary to glucagon which is ok to stop now.
   Adjust SSI as needed.
   - FS QID
   - ISS
   .
   HTN: holding meds while on pressors
   .
   FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes, IV NS for fluids

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer, who is currently in the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. She has been treated with antibiotics, vasopressors, and fluids, but her condition remains unstable. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.6°C, heart rate 56 bpm, blood pressure 101/38 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 87%. Her physical examination is notable for cool extremities and a low voltage EKG.

The patient has a high level of suspicion for septic shock, but her clinical presentation does not fully support this diagnosis. She has a history of profuse diarrhea and a grossly positive urine analysis, which may be contributing to her hypotension. However, her EKG shows low voltage, and her extremities are cool, which may suggest cardiogenic shock. She was treated with glucagon, which improved her blood pressure and heart rate, but this may not be the complete explanation for her hypotension.

The patient's diarrhea is acute and worsening, and she has a history of C. difficile infection, which may be contributing to her symptoms. She is also allergic to metronidazole, which may be exacerbating her diarrhea. The patient's leukocytosis is chronic, but has increased since admission, and her urine analysis shows a high white blood cell count, which may be indicative of a urinary tract infection.

The patient's acute renal failure is likely pre-renal in origin, and her electrolyte imbalance is likely due to GI losses. She has been treated with fluids and electrolyte replacement, and her blood pressure and heart rate are being closely monitored.

The patient's anion gap acidosis is likely secondary to elevated lactate and renal failure, and her hyperglycemia is secondary to glucagon treatment.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued septic shock or cardiogenic shock
* Worsening of acute renal failure
* Development of electrolyte imbalances
* Progression of anion gap acidosis
* Increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression
* Potential for further deterioration of the patient's underlying malignancies

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory values closely
* Adjust treatment as necessary to address any developing complications
* Consider repeating imaging studies to assess for any changes in the patient's underlying malignancies
* Consult with oncology to determine the best course of treatment for the patient's underlying cancers
* Consider stopping antibiotics if the patient's diarrhea improves and cultures remain negative
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte balance and acid-base status, and adjust treatment as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 67-year-old female with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic cervical cancer, is currently in the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 101/38 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 87%. She has a dilated right ventricle with elevated estimated pulmonary artery pressure and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Her renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 4.2 mg/dL. She is receiving multiple medications, including pressors, antibiotics, and anticoagulants. Her lab results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating cardiac injury, and elevated lactate levels, indicating tissue hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's dilated right ventricle and elevated estimated pulmonary artery pressure may lead to further cardiac decompensation, including pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to further fluid accumulation, electrolyte imbalances, and acidosis.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's pulmonary metastases may lead to further respiratory compromise, including hypoxia, hypercapnia, or respiratory failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient's diarrhea and elevated lactate levels may indicate sepsis, which can lead to further organ dysfunction, including cardiac, renal, or respiratory failure.
5. Bleeding Complications: The patient's anticoagulant therapy may increase the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Metastatic Spread: The patient's metastatic disease may continue to progress, leading to further organ involvement and potential complications."

   1. Relatively stable appearance of the large presacral soft tissue mass

   tumor
   is impossible to assess in absence of oral or IV contrast.
   2. Interval increase in size and number of multiple pulmonary nodules,
   consistent with worsening of metastatic disease.
   Chest x-ray this morning: no official read however appears definitely
   volume up with increasing pulmonary vascular congestion and obscuration
   of right costophrenic angle.
   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea, although of note, now patient currently denies having any
   diarrhea at home, and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to
   IVF, 2U PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension,
   although it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider PE
   high on the differential. Also on the differential diagnosis is right
   heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the setting of what
   appears to be bradycardia.  Also now with evidence of fluid overload on
   exam.
   - wean phenylephrine off, in terms of choosing pressors would likely
   pick dopamine for chronotropic as well as ionotropic effects
   - cultures are still all pending
 cont ceftriaxone, flagyl for now
   (flagyl with history of c. diff) ceftriaxone for dirty UA
   - V/Q to look for evidence of PE given that cannot get CTA given renal
   failure
   - if V/Q scan positive, would get head CT prior to initiation of
   anti-coagulation in the setting of metastatic disease and no recent
   head imaging (again would have to be non-constrast)
   - consider right heart EKG to look for evidence of right heart ischemia
   - send stool culture
   - send sputum culture
   - consider repeat UA/ucx
   .
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. FeNa initially 0.6% support pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**]
   fluid losses however repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   is likely reason for hyponatremia this morning. This metabolic acidosis
   is likely d/t GI losses. Would switch to IV NS today.
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   CT scan without contrast
   1. Relatively stable appearance of the large presacral soft tissue mass
   with
   destruction of the left sacrum. The involvement of the colon with the
   tumor
   is impossible to assess in absence of oral or IV contrast.
   2. Interval increase in size and number of multiple pulmonary nodules,
   consistent with worsening of metastatic disease.
   Chest x-ray this morning: no official read however appears definitely
   volume up with increasing pulmonary vascular congestion and obscuration
   of right costophrenic angle.
   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea, although of note, now patient currently denies having any
   diarrhea at home, and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to
   IVF, 2U PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension,
   although it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider PE
   high on the differential. Also on the differential diagnosis is right
   heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the setting of what
   appears to be bradycardia.  Also now with evidence of fluid overload on
   exam.
   - wean phenylephrine off, in terms of choosing pressors would likely
   pick dopamine for chronotropic as well as ionotropic effects
   - cultures are still all pending
 cont ceftriaxone, flagyl for now
   (flagyl with history of c. diff) ceftriaxone for dirty UA
   - V/Q to look for evidence of PE given that cannot get CTA given renal
   failure
   - if V/Q scan positive, would get head CT prior to initiation of
   anti-coagulation in the setting of metastatic disease and no recent
   head imaging (again would have to be non-constrast)
   - consider right heart EKG to look for evidence of right heart ischemia
   - send stool culture
   - send sputum culture
   - consider repeat UA/ucx
   .
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. FeNa initially 0.6% support pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**]
   fluid losses however repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   is likely reason for hyponatremia this morning. This metabolic acidosis
   is likely d/t GI losses. Would switch to IV NS today.
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - IVFs with bicarb
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.
   -          onc recs
   -          CT repeat if stable

* Pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Right heart infarct with RV hypokinesis

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Weaning of phenylephrine
* Continuing ceftriaxone and flagyl for now
* Ordering a V/Q scan to look for evidence of PE
* Considering a repeat UA/ucx
* Monitoring fever curve and WBC count
* Continuing ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, and considering discontinuing flagyl
* Switching to IV NS for fluid replacement
* Rechecking lactate and monitoring chem panel
* Contacting oncology for recommendations and attempting to repeat CT with imaging if the patient is stable

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of shock and organ dysfunction
* Development of sepsis and multi-organ failure
* Pulmonary embolism and right heart failure
* Right heart infarct and RV hypokinesis
* Acute kidney injury and worsening of chronic kidney disease
* Electrolyte imbalance and acidosis
* Infection and sepsis secondary to UTI/urosepsis
* Hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrhythmias

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo female admit with hypotension and bradycardia now with findings
   on ECHO to suggest significant impairment in RV function and
   significant increase in pulmonary artery pressures noted (mod PAH and
   TR).  This in in the setting of persistent bradycardia suggesting
   possible RV vascular distribution ischemia.  In addition the elevations
   in pulmonary artery pressure remain to be defined in regards to
   source.  Finally--she retains a significant bandemia in the setting of
   elevated WBC count.
   The source of persistent hypotension seems in large part to be driven
   by cardiac compromise (high BNP, ECHO findings) in the setting of
   persistent bradycardia
perhaps increased RV afterload and difficulty
   with maintenance of effective CO with increased demand in the setting
   of likely systemic infection with possible urinary source as evidenced
   by the elevated WBC count and bandemia.  GI source with diarrhea
   suspected but diarrhea not clearly confirmed.  The current source of
   the elevated PA pressures in the setting of preserved LV function
   remains to be defined.

   Vasodilatory Component-
   -CTX/Flagyl for possible bacterial infection and C. Diff
   -Neosynephrine/Levophed continue and hope to wean
   -Cultures pending
   Cardiogenic Component-
   -Possible PE raised as source of obstruction, may be tumor embolus as
   well
would like to treat for possible PE and favor treatment if we can
   find reassurance that bleeding risk is reasonable and head CT negative
   for CNS lesion/mass and study for PE is positive
   -Bradycardia persistent, BNP is up, do not see evidence of acute MI on
   findings thus far
mild elevations in enzymes have decreased and may be
   evidence of remote insult or current area at risk
   -Favor change to IV Beta specific agonists for support
with Dopamine
   representing reasonable compromise as with fixed and impaired RV stroke
   volume and peripheral beta effects Dobutamine represents a second
   choice.
   -LV function is preserved
   Hypovolemia-
   -Has been resolved with UVF to the point of likely volume overload
   2)Bradycardia-
   -Telemetry
   -Consider inotrope and chronotrope support for pressors
   -Will look to RV leads to help assure no ongoing insult in the setting
   of stable enzymes

   -Likley ATN
   -Continue support of BP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 67-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypotension and bradycardia. She has a history of sepsis, and her current condition is complicated by significant impairment in right ventricular (RV) function, increased pulmonary artery pressures, and persistent bradycardia. The patient has a bandemia and elevated white blood cell count, suggesting a possible urinary source of infection. She also has diarrhea, but this has not been clearly confirmed. The patient's cardiac compromise is thought to be driven by RV vascular distribution ischemia, increased RV afterload, and difficulty maintaining effective cardiac output.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Shock: The patient has a vasodilatory component, which is being treated with antibiotics and vasopressors. There is also a cardiogenic component, which is being treated with inotropes and chronotropes. The patient's bradycardia is persistent, and there is concern about the possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE) or tumor embolus.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is being monitored, and inotrope and chronotrope support may be necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is evidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Shock management: The patient will continue to receive antibiotics, vasopressors, and inotropes as needed.
2. Bradycardia management: The patient's bradycardia will be monitored, and inotrope and chronotrope support may be necessary.
3. Acute Renal Failure management: The patient will continue to receive supportive care, including diuretics and hemodialysis if necessary.
4. ICU care: The patient will receive nutrition through a nasogastric tube, and her glycemic control will be managed with a regular insulin sliding scale.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's persistent bradycardia and cardiogenic shock increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's increased pulmonary artery pressures and possible PE or tumor embolus increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Sepsis-induced multi-organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis and underlying medical conditions increase the risk of sepsis-induced multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure and underlying medical conditions increase the risk of acute kidney injury.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's diarrhea and possible GI source of infection increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and improve her outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo female admit with hypotension and bradycardia now with findings
   on ECHO to suggest significant impairment in RV function and
   significant increase in pulmonary artery pressures noted (mod PAH and
   TR).  This in in the setting of persistent bradycardia suggesting
   possible RV vascular distribution ischemia.  In addition the elevations
   in pulmonary artery pressure remain to be defined in regards to
   source.  Finally--she retains a significant bandemia in the setting of
   elevated WBC count.
   The source of persistent hypotension seems in large part to be driven
   by cardiac compromise (high BNP, ECHO findings) in the setting of
   persistent bradycardia
perhaps increased RV afterload and difficulty
   with maintenance of effective CO with increased demand in the setting
   of likely systemic infection with possible urinary source as evidenced
   by the elevated WBC count and bandemia.  GI source with diarrhea
   suspected but diarrhea not clearly confirmed.  The current source of
   the elevated PA pressures in the setting of preserved LV function
   remains to be defined.
   1)Shock-
   Vasodilatory Component-
   -CTX/Flagyl for possible bacterial infection and C. Diff
   -Neosynephrine/Levophed continue and hope to wean
   -Cultures pending
   Cardiogenic Component-
   -Possible PE raised as source of obstruction, may be tumor embolus as
   well
would like to treat for possible PE and favor treatment if we can
   find reassurance that bleeding risk is reasonable and head CT negative
   for CNS lesion/mass and study for PE is positive
   -Bradycardia persistent, BNP is up, do not see evidence of acute MI on
   findings thus far
mild elevations in enzymes have decreased and may be
   evidence of remote insult or current area at risk
   -Favor change to IV Beta specific agonists for support
with Dopamine
   representing reasonable compromise as with fixed and impaired RV stroke
   volume and peripheral beta effects Dobutamine represents a second
   choice.
   -LV function is preserved
   Hypovolemia-
   -Has been resolved with UVF to the point of likely volume overload
   2)Bradycardia-
   -Telemetry
   -Consider inotrope and chronotrope support for pressors
   -Will look to RV leads to help assure no ongoing insult in the setting
   of stable enzymes
   3)Acute Renal Failure-
   -Likley ATN
   -Continue support of BP
   FeNa=low and poor perfusion but now evolving a process consistent with
   ATN

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypotension and bradycardia. The patient has a history of sepsis, and the source of the sepsis is unknown. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, but the patient's condition has not improved.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is 56 beats per minute, which is below the normal range.
* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 101/38 mmHg, which is below the normal range.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula.
* Cardiac function: The patient's left ventricular function is preserved, but the right ventricular function is impaired, with a dilated hypokinetic right ventricle and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
* Renal function: The patient has acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 4.2 mg/dL.
* Liver function: The patient has mild elevations in liver enzymes, with a total bilirubin level of 1.2 mg/dL.
* Coagulation: The patient has a prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time.
* Hematology: The patient has a low white blood cell count and a high band count.
* Electrolytes: The patient has mild elevations in potassium and magnesium levels.
* Blood cultures: The patient has positive blood cultures for bacteria.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, acute liver failure, or respiratory failure.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac compromise may lead to cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, or cardiac failure.
* Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure may lead to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to respiratory arrest or chronic respiratory disease.
* Infectious complications: The patient's sepsis may lead to secondary infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Vasopressor support: The patient will continue to receive vasopressor support to maintain blood pressure.
* Inotropic support: The patient will receive inotropic support to improve cardiac function.
* Antibiotic therapy: The patient will continue to receive antibiotic therapy to treat sepsis.
* Renal support: The patient will receive renal support to manage acute renal failure.
* Respiratory support: The patient will receive respiratory support to manage respiratory failure.
* Nutrition: The patient will receive nutrition support through a parenteral nutrition regimen.
* Glycemic control: The patient will receive glycemic control through a regular insulin sliding scale regimen."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a complex medical condition. Over the past 24 hours, the patient has undergone various tests and procedures, including a nuclear medicine scan, ultrasound, and infusion of medications. The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C (96.9°F), heart rate of 56 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 104/39 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and is being monitored for cardiac and respiratory function.

Lab results show an increase in white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels, indicating ongoing inflammation and potentially septic response. The patient's renal function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 4.1 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 27.2 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels suggest ongoing inflammation and potentially septic response. Close monitoring and prompt treatment are necessary to prevent sepsis-related complications.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine and BUN levels indicate compromised renal function, which may worsen if not managed promptly. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration of renal replacement therapy may be necessary.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen therapy and ABG results suggest ongoing respiratory distress. Close monitoring and potential intubation may be necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's heart rate and blood pressure are stable, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.

In conclusion, the patient requires close monitoring and prompt treatment to prevent potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea, although of note, now patient currently denies having any
   diarrhea at home, and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to
   IVF, 2U PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension,
   although it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider PE
   high on the differential. Also on the differential diagnosis is right
   heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the setting of what
   appears to be bradycardia.  Also now with evidence of fluid overload on
   exam.
   - wean phenylephrine off, in terms of choosing pressors would likely
   pick dopamine for chronotropic as well as ionotropic effects if unable
   to wean off current pressors right now
   - cultures are still all pending
 cont ceftriaxone, flagyl for now
   (flagyl with history of c. diff) ceftriaxone for dirty UA
   - V/Q to look for evidence of PE given that cannot get CTA given renal
   failure
   - if V/Q scan positive, would get head CT prior to initiation of
   anti-coagulation in the setting of metastatic disease and no recent
   head imaging (again would have to be non-constrast)
   - consider right heart EKG to look for evidence of right heart ischemia

   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. FeNa initially 0.6% support pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**]
   fluid losses however repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   may be contributing to hyponatreamia.
   Hyponatremia: Suspect that hypervolemic hyponatremia. Got 20 IV lasix
   today. Will hold off on additional fluids at this time. Will check
   urine osm, urine lytes and serum osms
   - fluid restriction as needed

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea, although of note, now patient currently denies having any
   diarrhea at home, and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to
   IVF, 2U PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension,
   although it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider PE
   high on the differential. Also on the differential diagnosis is right
   heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the setting of what
   appears to be bradycardia.  Also now with evidence of fluid overload on
   exam.
   - wean phenylephrine off, in terms of choosing pressors would likely
   pick dopamine for chronotropic as well as ionotropic effects if unable
   to wean off current pressors right now
   - cultures are still all pending
 cont ceftriaxone, flagyl for now
   (flagyl with history of c. diff) ceftriaxone for dirty UA
   - V/Q to look for evidence of PE given that cannot get CTA given renal
   failure
   - if V/Q scan positive, would get head CT prior to initiation of
   anti-coagulation in the setting of metastatic disease and no recent
   head imaging (again would have to be non-constrast)
   - consider right heart EKG to look for evidence of right heart ischemia
   - send stool culture
   - send sputum culture
   - consider repeat UA/ucx

   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. FeNa initially 0.6% support pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**]

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer, who is currently in the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (96.9°F)
* Heart rate: 56 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 104/39 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 95%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 36.0
* Hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 167
* Creatinine: 4.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 27.2
* Sodium: 122 mg/dL
* Potassium: 4.1 mEq/L
* Chloride: 101 mEq/L
* Bicarbonate: 16 mEq/L
* Anion gap: 17.3
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L
* LDH: 615 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 5.8 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Peripheral vascular: Right radial pulse not assessed, left radial pulse not assessed, right DP pulse not assessed, left DP pulse not assessed
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Responds to stimuli, movement not assessed, tone not assessed

The patient's diagnosis is shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure, with a differential diagnosis including hypovolemic shock, septic shock, cardiogenic shock, and pulmonary embolism. The patient is currently receiving pressors, including levophed and phenylephrine, and has been given 2 units of packed red blood cells.

The patient's plan includes:

* Weaning off phenylephrine
* Continuing ceftriaxone and flagyl for now
* Performing a V/Q scan to look for evidence of pulmonary embolism
* Considering a right heart EKG to look for evidence of right heart ischemia
* Sending stool and sputum cultures
* Considering repeat UA/ucx
* Monitoring fever curve and WBC count
* Continuing ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, and considering discontinuing flagyl
* Treating acute renal failure with fluid restriction and electrolyte management
* Monitoring for anion gap acidosis and rechecking lactate levels
* Contacting oncology for recommendations and attempting to repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Hypovolemic shock leading to decreased cardiac output and organ perfusion
* Septic shock leading to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and death
* Cardiogenic shock leading to decreased cardiac output and organ perfusion
* Pulmonary embolism leading to hypoxia, respiratory failure, and death
* Acute renal failure leading to electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, and death
* Anion gap acidosis leading to electrolyte imbalance and acidosis
* Diabetic ketoacidosis leading to electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, and death
* Hyponatremia leading to seizures, coma, and death
* Lactic acidosis leading to electrolyte imbalance, acidosis, and death."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation patient with hx of profuse
   diarrhea, although of note, now patient currently denies having any
   diarrhea at home, and grossly positive UA. In ED, BP not responsive to
   IVF, 2U PRBC arguing against hypovolemia as sole cause of hypotension,
   although it certainly may play a role. She has remained afebrile, but
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider PE
   high on the differential. Also on the differential diagnosis is right
   heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the setting of what
   appears to be bradycardia.  Also now with evidence of fluid overload on
   exam.
   - wean phenylephrine off, in terms of choosing pressors would likely
   pick dopamine for chronotropic as well as ionotropic effects if unable
   to wean off current pressors right now
   - cultures are still all pending
 cont ceftriaxone, flagyl for now
   (flagyl with history of c. diff) ceftriaxone for dirty UA
   - V/Q to look for evidence of PE given that cannot get CTA given renal
   failure
   - if V/Q scan positive, would get head CT prior to initiation of
   anti-coagulation in the setting of metastatic disease and no recent
   head imaging (again would have to be non-constrast)
   - consider right heart EKG to look for evidence of right heart ischemia
   - send stool culture
   - send sputum culture
   - consider repeat UA/ucx
   .
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. Difficult to determine if this
   is secondary to infection or malignancy. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. UA with >50WBCs concerning
   for UTI/urosepsis.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis, can consider d/c flagyl at
   this time
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. Now with ARF in setting of
   hypotension. FeNa initially 0.6% support pre-renal etiology likely [**1-9**]
   fluid losses however repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   may be contributing to hyponatreamia.
   Hyponatremia: Suspect that hypervolemic hyponatremia. Got 20 IV lasix
   today. Will hold off on additional fluids at this time. Will check
   urine osm, urine lytes and serum osms
   - fluid restriction as needed
   - will continue to follow-lytes
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer. She is currently admitted to the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (96.9°F)
* Heart rate: 56 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 104/39 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 17 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* SpO2: 95%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient has undergone various diagnostic tests, including nuclear medicine, ultrasound, and laboratory tests. The results are as follows:

* Renal ultrasound: Left hydronephrosis
* Q scan: Low probability for pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Complete blood count (CBC): Leukocytosis (36.0 x 10^9/L)
* Blood chemistry: Elevated lactate (1.1 mmol/L), elevated creatinine (4.1 mg/dL), and elevated potassium (5.8 mmol/L)
* Electrolyte panel: Hypokalemia (3.9 mmol/L), hypocalcemia (7.6 mg/dL), and hypomagnesemia (1.9 mg/dL)
* Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL
* Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP): 122 pg/mL
* D-dimer: 18.8 K/uL

The patient's medical condition is complex, and several potential medical complications are present. These include:

1. Septic shock: The patient's rising WBC count, hypotension, and lack of fever argue against septic shock, but it remains a possibility.
2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's history of profuse diarrhea and grossly positive urinalysis (UA) suggest that hypovolemic shock may be a contributing factor.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low voltage electrocardiogram (EKG) and hypotension suggest that cardiogenic shock may be a possibility.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's Q scan results are negative, but PE remains a possibility given the patient's history of cancer and the presence of right ventricular hypokinesis on echocardiogram.
5. Right heart infarct: The patient's echocardiogram results suggest that right heart infarct may be a possibility, especially in the setting of bradycardia.
6. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's repeat FeNa results suggest that ATN may be a contributing factor to her acute renal failure.
7. Anion gap acidosis: The patient's elevated lactate and anion gap acidosis suggest that this condition may be present.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may be secondary to hypervolemic hyponatremia, and fluid restriction may be necessary.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Weaning off phenylephrine and dopamine if possible
2. Continuing ceftriaxone and flagyl for now
3. Performing a V/Q scan to look for evidence of PE
4. Sending stool and sputum cultures
5. Considering repeat UA/ucx
6. Monitoring the patient's fever curve and WBC count
7. Continuing ceftriaxone for UTI/urosepsis
8. Holding off on additional fluids
9. Following the patient's electrolytes and acid-base status
10. Contacting oncology for recommendations regarding the patient's cervical cancer and NSCLC
11. Repeating CT scan with imaging if the patient is stable

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she is currently receiving ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation diarrhea was thought to be
   the etiology of her hypotension but the patient has not had any BMs
   since admission. Her other cultures are pending, with urine growing
   E.coli pan-sensitive to current abx. She has remained afebrile, with
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider
   PE, however V/Q scan showed low probablility. Also on the differential
   diagnosis is right heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the
   setting of what appears to be bradycardia.  Patient is now off pressors
   but still maintaining a low MAP while sleeping.
   - fluid bolus for low UOP, low MAP
   - cont ceftriaxone for E.coli UTI
   -d/c flagyl as unlikely c.diff
   - f/u pending cultures
   - off pressors now but may need to restart if not fluid responsive
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. Urine ctx with E.coli which
   may have caused sepsis? Blood cultures still pending.  Also CBC today
   with decreased plt, WBC and hematocrit.  [**Month (only) 8**] be drug related (ie. HIT-
   thrombocytopenia).
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI
   -repeat CBC
   -if hct is decreased consider guaiac stools
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. It is likely this put her at
   risk for further renal damage. Her initial FeNa 0.6% which supported
   pre-renal etiology; on repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   may be contributing to hyponatreamia.
   -consult renal
   -continue IVF and trend Cr
   -avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -Monday ask lab to spin urine
   Hyponatremia: Suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia despite high CVP (pt has
   TR which can falsely elevate CVP measurements). Will continue to
   support with maintenance fluids IV NS and bolus as needed. [**Month (only) 8**] need to
   give NaHCO3 as well to increase bicarb while ATN resolves.
   -IV NS, caution not to overload
   - follow electrolytes
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - recheck lactate

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer. She is currently in the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 56 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 104/39 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease, and her baseline creatinine level is 1.5-2.0 mg/dL. Her initial fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) was 0.6%, which suggests a pre-renal etiology, but on repeat FeNa, it is 2.3%, which suggests a component of acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and decreased hemoglobin level. Her blood cultures are pending, and her urine culture grew E. coli, which is sensitive to the current antibiotics.

The patient's differential diagnosis includes hypovolemic shock, septic shock, and cardiogenic shock. The low voltage electrocardiogram (EKG) and the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes make cardiogenic shock a possibility. The patient's hypotension and low MAP also raise the possibility of right heart infarct with right ventricular hypokinesis.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Fluid bolus for low urine output and low MAP.
2. Continuing ceftriaxone for E. coli UTI.
3. Discontinuing Flagyl as unlikely to be causing Clostridium difficile (C. diff).
4. Monitoring fever curve and WBC count.
5. Continuing antibiotics for UTI.
6. Repeating CBC and considering guaiac stools if hematocrit is decreased.
7. Consulting renal team for acute renal failure.
8. Continuing IV fluids and trending creatinine.
9. Avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
10. Requesting lab to spin urine on Monday.
11. Supporting patient with maintenance fluids IV NS and bolus as needed.
12. Monitoring electrolytes and rechecking lactate.
13. Contacting oncology for recommendations on cervical cancer and NSCLC.
14. Attempting to repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and her blood cultures are pending. If the cultures are positive, it could lead to sepsis.
2. Right heart infarct: The patient's EKG shows low voltage, and her history of hypertension and diabetes make cardiogenic shock a possibility.
3. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and her FeNa is 2.3%, which suggests a component of ATN.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, and she is receiving IV fluids, which could lead to hyponatremia if not monitored carefully.
5. Anion gap acidosis: The patient's lactate level is elevated, and her renal failure could lead to anion gap acidosis.
6. C. diff colitis: The patient is receiving antibiotics, and the possibility of C. diff colitis should be considered.
7. Kidney failure: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and her renal function is compromised. If not managed properly, it could lead to kidney failure.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes make cardiogenic shock a possibility, and the patient's hypotension and low MAP raise the possibility of right heart infarct with right ventricular hypokinesis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of stage 3 non-small cell lung cancer and cervical cancer, admitted to the ICU with shock, worsening diarrhea, and acute renal failure (ARF). She has been receiving off-and-on Flagyl, and pressors have been discontinued. The patient has undergone various tests, including a V/Q scan, echocardiogram, and stem test, with a low probability of pulmonary embolism (PE) and hydronephrosis of the left kidney.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C (96.9°F), heart rate of 56 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 122/49 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula. Her cardiac rhythm is sinus bradycardia, and her peripheral pulses are present.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, with no acute distress. Her cardiovascular examination is normal, with no murmurs or rubs. Her respiratory examination shows symmetric chest expansion, no crackles or wheezes, and scattered end-expiratory wheezes.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Her creatinine levels are increasing, and her urine cultures are growing E. coli. Her blood cultures have not yet been reported.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is no longer on pressors, and maintenance fluids are being given to manage her hypotension. Antibiotics for E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI) will be continued, and Flagyl will be discontinued since her diarrhea has improved independently of its initiation. Blood cultures will be followed up.
2. ARF: The patient's creatinine levels are still increasing, and a renal ultrasound with hydronephrosis has been ordered. A urology consultation has been requested to determine the cause of the renal decline.
3. Decreased platelet count: The patient's platelet count has decreased by nearly 50%, and a CBC will be rechecked.
4. Cervical and non-small cell lung cancer: No active intervention was performed today.
5. Other plans: The patient will continue to receive ICU care, including nutrition and glycemic control management. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) will be continued.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Continued septic shock and organ dysfunction, including ARF and thrombocytopenia.
2. Prolonged ICU stay and potential for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Increased risk of VAP and other nosocomial infections.
4. Potential for further decline in platelet count and increased risk of bleeding.
5. Need for further interventions, such as dialysis, to manage ARF.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her care plan accordingly to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and a possible stent for left-sided hydrocephalus. They have a history of allergies to Zocor, Flagyl, and myalgias. The patient received antibiotics, including Metronidazole and Ceftriaxone, and is currently on heparin sodium for prophylaxis. They have a history of sinus bradycardia and are receiving oxygen therapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 54 bpm, and blood pressure of 97/42 mmHg. They have a central venous pressure of 13 mmHg and are receiving fluids. The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, as well as anemia and thrombocytopenia. They have a white blood cell count of 30.2 and a hemoglobin level of 25.6 g/dL. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. They have a lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L and a troponin-T level of 0.05 ng/mL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and they have a history of ATN, which may indicate AKI.
2. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and they have a history of antibiotic use, which may indicate sepsis.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may indicate a bleeding risk.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may indicate a risk of cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
5. Infection: The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, which may indicate an infection.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is low, and they have a history of sinus bradycardia, which may indicate cardiovascular instability.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 93%, and they are receiving oxygen therapy, which may indicate respiratory failure.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological examination is limited, and they have a history of possible hydrocephalus, which may indicate a risk of neurological complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypovolemic vs Septic shock: On presentation diarrhea was thought to be
   the etiology of her hypotension but the patient has not had any BMs
   since admission. Her other cultures are pending, with urine growing
   E.coli pan-sensitive to current abx. She has remained afebrile, with
   rising WBC, hypotension which speaks to septic shock, however
   clinically this does not appear to be the case as she seems very
   comfortable on exam. Lastly, cardiogenic shock needs to be considered
   given hypotension, low voltage EKG. She was on max dose levophed and
   phenylephrine with MAPS of 55-60. Given yesterday
s echo findings which
   demonstrate a dilated right ventricle that is hypokinetic with elevated
   pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension would consider
   PE, however V/Q scan showed low probablility. Also on the differential
   diagnosis is right heart infarct with RV hypokinesis especially in the
   setting of what appears to be bradycardia.  Patient is now off pressors
   but still maintaining a low MAP while sleeping.
   - fluid bolus for low UOP, low MAP
   - cont ceftriaxone for E.coli UTI
   -d/c flagyl as unlikely c.diff
   - f/u pending cultures
   - off pressors now but may need to restart if not fluid responsive
   .
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission, no bands. CT abd/pelvis did not show
   evidence of inflammation/abscess however it also did not have any
   contrast which limits ability to evaluate. Urine ctx with E.coli which
   may have caused sepsis? Blood cultures still pending.  Also CBC today
   with decreased plt, WBC and hematocrit.  [**Month (only) 8**] be drug related (ie. HIT-
   thrombocytopenia).
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - continue ceftriaxone for UTI
   -repeat CBC
   -if hct is decreased consider guaiac stools
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. It is likely this put her at
   risk for further renal damage. Her initial FeNa 0.6% which supported
   pre-renal etiology; on repeat FeNa is 2.3 % which suggests component of
   ATN. Low bicarbonate initially treated with D5W and 150 NaHCO3, which
   may be contributing to hyponatreamia.
   -consult renal
   -continue IVF and trend Cr
   -avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -Monday ask lab to spin urine
   Hyponatremia: Suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia despite high CVP (pt has
   TR which can falsely elevate CVP measurements). Will continue to
   support with maintenance fluids IV NS and bolus as needed. [**Month (only) 8**] need to
   give NaHCO3 as well to increase bicarb while ATN resolves.
   -IV NS, caution not to overload
   - follow electrolytes
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Also with probable non gap component secondary to
   diarrhea and saline administration
   - recheck lactate
   - monitor chem panel
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations. Also attempt to
   repeat CT with imaging if patient is stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of Stage III non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic cervical cancer, who was admitted to the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. She has been treated with antibiotics for an E. coli UTI, but her condition has not improved. She has been on maximum dose of vasopressors, but is now off pressors and maintaining a low mean arterial pressure (MAP) while sleeping. The patient has a dilated right ventricle with elevated pulmonary artery pressures and persistent hypotension, which may be due to pulmonary embolism (PE) or right heart infarct. She also has leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypovolemia and septic shock.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE) or right heart infarct, which may be contributing to her hypotension and low MAP.
3. Septic shock due to E. coli UTI and possible sepsis.
4. Leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia, which may be due to chronic inflammation or medication-related side effects.
5. Anion gap acidosis due to elevated lactate and renal failure.
6. Hyponatremia due to hypovolemia and saline administration.
7. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypovolemia, septic shock, and ATN.
8. Cardiogenic shock due to hypotension, low voltage EKG, and possible right heart infarct.
9. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) due to sepsis and leukocytosis.
10. Cervical cancer metastasis and potential sacral metastasis, which may be contributing to her poor overall condition.

Assessment and plan:

The patient will continue to receive antibiotics for her E. coli UTI and will have a repeat CT scan to evaluate for pulmonary embolism and right heart infarct. She will also have a repeat echocardiogram to evaluate for right ventricular function and pulmonary artery pressures. The patient will be monitored for signs of sepsis, AKI, and cardiogenic shock, and will receive supportive care including fluids, vasopressors, and electrolyte replacement as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo W with PMH of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer here
   with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.
   Hypotention: To date unclear exactly why patient continues to be
   hypotensive. Septic shock at this point is unlikely given negative
   cultures, down trending WBC and no fevers. Cardiogenic and obstructive
   shock have been ruled out. Distributive shock is not consistent with
   presentation and clinical exam. Cortisol and TSH labs were appropriate
   and did not support adrenal insufficiency or hypothyroidism. Patient is
   now off pressors but still maintaining a low MAP while sleeping. There
   is question of autonomic dysfunction secondary to diabetes or
   chemotherapy treatments in the past. She has known neuropathy which
   could support this theory.
   - fluid bolus for low UOP, low MAP
   - d/c ceftriaxone as last UCx negative
   - check orthostasis
    - f/u pending cultures
   Leukocytosis: Chronically elevated WBC count over last several weeks,
   with increase since admission. WBC has continued to trend downward.
   Given leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia would consider a transient
   viral infection which may have caused her fever, white count and
   diarrhea, and caused her decompensation.  Also noted is a drop in her
   hematocrit over the last two days. It has actually trended down towards
   her baseline but will guaiac stools and trend CBC to be safe.
   -monitor fever curve and wbc count
   - follow pending cultures
   - repeat CBC
   - guaiac stools
   Acute Renal Failure: Baseline creatinine 1.5-2 since [**6-15**], likely
   chronic insults secondary to HTN and DM. It is likely this put her at
   risk for further renal damage. Renal consult noted muddy brown casts on
   urine, recommended to check LDH, schistocytes, FeNa and repeat renal US
   on Monday. Urology is also following and found L sided hydroureter on
   imaging. Debating whether intervention is necessary and is playing any
   role in her ATN (? Why isn
t other kidney picking up the slack?)
   -Renal US tomorrow
   -continue IVF and trend Cr
   -avoid nephrotoxic agents
   -follow pending labs and smear
   -f/u any new renal and urology recs
   Hyponatremia: Resolved since admission and NS fluid boluses. Will
   continue to support with maintenance fluids IV NS and bolus as needed.
   -IV NS, caution not to overload
   - follow electrolytes
   Anion gap acidosis: Likely secondary to elevated lactate as well as
   renal failure. Resolved since admission.
   - follow chemistry
   - IV fluids as above
   .
   Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: currently with known sacral mets. Will contact
   oncology to see if they have any recommendations.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of Stage III non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic cervical cancer. She was admitted to the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. Her blood pressure has been low, and she has required pressors to maintain a stable blood pressure. She has also had leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and hyponatremia. The patient's acute renal failure is likely secondary to chronic insults from hypertension and diabetes. The patient has also had an anion gap acidosis, which has resolved since admission.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Autonomic dysfunction: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia may be secondary to autonomic dysfunction, which could be caused by diabetes or chemotherapy treatments.
2. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's muddy brown casts in urine and decreased urine output suggest ATN, which could be caused by sepsis, hypovolemia, or nephrotoxic agents.
3. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's baseline creatinine levels suggest chronic kidney disease, which could be exacerbated by her acute renal failure.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia could be secondary to a transient viral infection, which may have caused her fever, white count, and diarrhea.
5. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes could be complicated by hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or ketoacidosis.
6. Cervical cancer/NSCLC: The patient's known sacral metastases could be complicated by further metastases or complications from chemotherapy.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension could be complicated by further cardiovascular events, such as heart failure or stroke.
8. Hyperkalemia: The patient's hyponatremia and anion gap acidosis could be complicated by hyperkalemia.
9. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support and oxygen therapy could be complicated by further respiratory failure or respiratory acidosis.
10. Sepsis: The patient's negative cultures and lack of fever do not rule out sepsis, which could be caused by a variety of pathogens."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year old female with stg 3 NSCLCa, cervical Ca, initially presenting
   with worsening diarrhea, E.Coli UTI and admitted for hypotension. She
   is no longer on pressors but continues to require intermittent fluid
   resuscitation to maintain MAP>60's. She is on appropriate abx for
   E.coli UTI, and so far, her hypotension workup has included Echo, V/Q
   (low prob), random cortisol level which have not identified another
   reason for the shock.
   MAP
s continue to intermittently drop though mostly overnight and
   improved after awakening
   -continue fluid bolus as needed- CVP
s may be artificially elevated
   because of TR
   -check orthostatis/eval autonomic function
   ARF: W/u includes ATN, may have post-obstructive component.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 67-year-old female with stage 3 NSCLC and cervical cancer, was admitted with worsening diarrhea, E. coli UTI, and hypotension. She has been receiving intermittent fluid resuscitation to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. The patient's hypotension workup, including echocardiogram, ventilation-perfusion scan (low probability), and random cortisol level, has not identified another reason for the shock. Her vital signs are stable, with a MAP that continues to intermittently drop, particularly overnight, but improves after awakening. The patient's renal function is impaired, with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and a possible post-obstructive component.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is impaired, and ATN is a complication of sepsis. AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or even end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
2. Sepsis: The patient's E. coli UTI and hypotension suggest a possible septic shock. Sepsis can lead to multi-organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and hepatic failure.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory support, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation, may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypotension and potential sepsis may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiac failure.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's diarrhea and possible sepsis may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, perforation, or bleeding.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's sepsis and potential AKI may lead to neurological complications, such as encephalopathy, seizures, or stroke.
7. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's immobility and potential sepsis make her at risk for VTE, which can lead to pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
8. Infections: The patient's UTI and potential sepsis make her at risk for additional infections, such as pneumonia, bacteremia, or wound infections.
9. Malnutrition: The patient's poor nutritional status and potential gastrointestinal complications may lead to malnutrition, which can worsen her overall condition.
10. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility and potential sepsis make her at risk for pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection, necrosis, and potentially life-threatening complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer, admitted to the ICU with hypotension, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. She has been treated with antibiotics, pressor support, and IV fluids. Her condition has improved, with her heart rate and blood pressure returning to baseline. However, she still has elevated creatinine levels and evidence of hydronephrosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and she has been diagnosed with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). This may lead to further decline in kidney function and potential need for dialysis.
2. Hydronephrosis: The patient has moderate left-sided hydronephrosis, which may lead to further complications if not addressed. A nephrostomy tube may be necessary to drain the kidney.
3. UTI: The patient has a history of UTI and has been treated with antibiotics. However, there is a risk of recurrent UTI or development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
4. Sepsis: Although the patient's cultures are negative, there is still a risk of sepsis due to her underlying conditions and the presence of leukocytosis.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac status is uncertain, and there is a risk of cardiac complications due to her underlying conditions and the use of pressor support.
6. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's oral medications have been held, and there is a risk of nutritional deficiencies if not adequately managed.
7. Glycemic Control: The patient's glucose levels are elevated, and there is a risk of further complications if not adequately managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Proceed with a nephrostomy tube to drain the hydronephrotic kidney.
3. Continue to manage the patient's UTI with antibiotics and monitor for recurrent infection.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment accordingly.
5. Ensure adequate nutrition and glycemic control to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic cervical cancer, admitted to the ICU with shock, diarrhea, and acute renal failure. The patient's hypotension has resolved, and he is off pressor support. The patient has leukocytosis, and the etiology is uncertain. He has a UTI, which is being treated with ceftriaxone. The patient has acute renal failure with muddy brown casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He also has hyponatremia, which has resolved since admission, and anion gap acidosis, which is likely secondary to lactic acidosis and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Despite negative cultures, the patient's leukocytosis and UTI diagnosis raise concerns for sepsis.
2. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's renal failure and muddy brown casts on urine analysis suggest ATN, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
3. Lactic Acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis may be secondary to lactic acidosis, which can worsen with continued renal failure and hypotension.
4. UTI Recurrence: The patient's UTI diagnosis and treatment may not have fully resolved the infection, increasing the risk of recurrence.
5. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and the potential for rebound hypertension after stopping pressors require close monitoring.
6. Cervical Cancer Progression: The patient's metastatic cervical cancer may continue to progress, potentially affecting his overall prognosis and quality of life.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's ICU stay and potential for prolonged recovery may lead to malnutrition, which can worsen his overall health and increase the risk of complications.
8. Infection Control: The patient's UTI diagnosis and treatment require careful infection control measures to prevent hospital-acquired infections.

These potential medical complications require close monitoring and management to prevent complications and improve the patient's outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of Stage III NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer, currently admitted to the ICU with hypotension, diarrhea, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 61 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 108/35 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 26.3
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.0 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 80
* Creatinine (Cr): 4.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL
* TCO2: 19 mmHg
* Glucose: 121 mg/dL
* Other lab results: PT/PTT/INR: 17.7/44.7/1.6, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 77/9/0.05, Differential-Neuts: 93.0%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 1.8%, Mono: 2.0%, Eos: 3.2%, Lactic Acid: 1.1 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.0 g/dL, LDH: 282 IU/L, Ca++: 8.0 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.7 mg/dL, PO4: 5.5 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypotension: Unclear etiology, currently off pressor support
* Leukocytosis: Uncertain etiology, afebrile
* Acute Renal Failure (ARF): Baseline creatinine of 1.5-2, muddy brown casts consistent with Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN), urology follow-up
* Hyponatremia: Resolved since admission
* Anion gap acidosis: Resolved since admission, likely secondary to lactic acidosis and renal failure
* Cervical Cancer/NSCLC: Known sacral metastases, follow-up with oncology
* Diabetes Mellitus (DM): Orals held, continue insulin sliding scale and accuchecks
* Hypertension (HTN): Off pressors, oral anti-hypertensives not restarted
* Fluid and Electrolyte Imbalance (FEN): PO replete as necessary, IVF
* Pressure Ulcer Prevention (PPX): SCDs
* Disposition: Call out today

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

* Sepsis: Although cultures are negative, the patient's hypotension and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of sepsis.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of NSCLC and metastatic cervical cancer increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
* Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure and ATN increase the risk of further renal damage, such as chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
* Metabolic complications: The patient's anion gap acidosis and lactic acidosis increase the risk of metabolic complications, such as hyperkalemia or hypokalemia.
* Infection: The patient's history of cervical cancer and metastatic disease increases the risk of infection, particularly in the urinary tract or respiratory tract.
* Pressure ulcers: The patient's history of pressure ulcers increases the risk of further pressure ulcers, particularly if they are not properly managed.

Based on this assessment, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their medical conditions, as well as prevention and management of potential complications."
