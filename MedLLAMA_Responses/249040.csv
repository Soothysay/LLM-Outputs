   Assessment and Plan
   67 year old female with a history of crohn's disease s/p multiple
   abdominal surgeries with ileostomy and short gut syndrome,
   cholecystitis s/p open cholecystostomy tube in [**Month (only) 807**] and ERCP with stent
   placement on [**2135-9-30**] who presents from home with worsening abdominal
   pain and nausea.
   Abdominal Pain/Leukocytosis:  Patient currently with diffuse abdominal
   pain, leukocytosis with left shift, and rising LFTS.  Pain developed
   shortly after recent ERCP which is concerning for stent occlusion or
   accumulation of sludge.  Other potential etiologies of her abdominal
   pain include ischemic bowel given diffuse pain with soft abdomen and
   guaiac positive stools, obstruction (less likely given exam),
   perforation, abscess, biliary/peritoneal fistula. Right upper quadrant
   ultrasound with 13 mm CBD.  CT scan showed distended gallbladder with
   gallstones.  WBC count and bilirubin rising.
   - trend LFTs, WBC, lactate
   - plan for ERCP first thing this AM
   - surgical team co-managing
   - vancomycin and unasyn for now, if worsening clinical presentation
   will broaden to zosyn
   - zofran, compazine and morphine for pain and nausea
   - NPO, LR @ 150 cc/hr, with boluses to maintain pressures and relieve
   tachycardia
   - if tachycardia does not resolve after ERCP, low threshold for placing
   central line and monitoring CVP
   - follow blood, urine cultures from the emergency room
   Coagulopathy:  Patient with INR of 2.0 on presentation.  Unclear
   etiology.  She has been as high as 1.6 in the past.  Most likely
   etiology is nutritional deficiencies but in this setting must be
   concerned for consumptive coagulopathy (less likely given normal
   platelet count). She has received 5 mg IV vitamin K and one unit of
   FFP.
   - DIC labs not concerning
   - monitor INR
   Guaiac positive stools:  Most likely etiology is her known crohn's
   disease, but in this setting also concerned for ischemic colitis,
   ulcers, other etiologies of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Patient
   refusing NGT.  Hematocrit currently stable. Port for access, currently
   unable to obtain additional peripherals.
   - active type and screen
   - port for access
   - hematocrits [**Hospital1 7**]
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - surgical team following
   Crohn's disease:  As above, s/p multiple surgeries with ileostomy with
   short gut syndrome.  Currently can't take PO medications.  Will need to
   address with gastroenterology and surgery management if she continues
   to be unable to take POs.
   - start stress dose IV steroids as pt unable to continue taking POs
   - will discuss with GI about restarting home 5-ASA
   - close monitoring of electrolytes ([**Hospital1 7**] lytes) given short gut syndrome

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and short gut syndrome. She presented to the hospital with worsening abdominal pain and nausea. She has a portacath in place and is currently receiving IV antibiotics, pain management, and fluid resuscitation. Her laboratory results show rising liver function tests (LFTs), leukocytosis, and a coagulopathy. She has a guaiac-positive stool and is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ischemic bowel: The patient's diffuse abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and rising LFTs may be indicative of ischemic bowel disease. This could lead to necrosis of the bowel wall, perforation, or abscess formation.
2. Obstruction: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness may be caused by an intestinal obstruction, which could lead to bowel perforation, abscess formation, or necrosis.
3. Perforation: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness may be caused by a perforation of the bowel, which could lead to peritonitis, abscess formation, or sepsis.
4. Abscess: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness may be caused by an abscess, which could lead to sepsis, peritonitis, or bowel perforation.
5. Biliary/peritoneal fistula: The patient's rising bilirubin and LFTs may be indicative of a biliary or peritoneal fistula, which could lead to sepsis, peritonitis, or bowel perforation.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial bleeding.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac-positive stool and rising bilirubin may be indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to anemia, hypovolemic shock, or sepsis.
8. Sepsis: The patient's rising LFTs, leukocytosis, and coagulopathy may be indicative of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction, shock, or death.
9. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient's indwelling portacath and IV antibiotics may increase her risk of developing a CLABSI.
10. Catheter-related urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's indwelling portacath and IV antibiotics may increase her risk of developing a UTI.

Based on the patient's progress note, it appears that she is at risk for several medical complications. Close monitoring and management of her condition are necessary to prevent or treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 year old female with a history of crohn's disease s/p multiple
   abdominal surgeries with ileostomy and short gut syndrome,
   cholecystitis s/p open cholecystostomy tube in [**Month (only) 807**] and ERCP with stent
   placement on [**2135-9-30**] who presents from home with worsening abdominal
   pain and nausea.
   Abdominal Pain/Leukocytosis:  Patient currently with diffuse abdominal
   pain, leukocytosis with left shift, and rising LFTS.  Initially her
   bilirubin was not elevated but now it is 2.3.  Pain developed shortly
   after recent ERCP which is concerning for stent occlusion or
   accumulation of sludge.  Other potential etiologies of her abdominal
   pain include ischemic bowel given diffuse pain with soft abdomen and
   guaiac positive stools, obstruction (less likely given exam),
   perforation, abscess, biliary/peritoneal fistula. Right upper quadrant
   ultrasound with 13 mm CBD.  CT scan pending.  WBC count and bilirubin
   rising.
   - trend LFTs, WBC, lactate
   - CT scan stat with IV contrast
   - surgical team co-managing
   - vancomycin and unasyn for now, if worsening clinical presentation
   will broaden to zosyn
   - zofran and morphine for pain and nausea
   - NPO, LR @ 150 cc/hr
   - likely ERCP in the AM
   - follow blood, urine cultures from the emergency room
   - will get baseline CXR tonight
   Coagulopathy:  Patient with INR of 2.0 on presentation.  Unclear
   etiology.  She has been as high as 1.6 in the past.  Most likely
   etiology is nutritional deficiencies but in this setting must be
   concerned for consumptive coagulopathy (less likely given normal
   platelet count). She has received 5 mg IV vitamin K and one unit of
   FFP.
   - DIC labs
   - monitor INR
   - FFP if necessary prior to ERCP in the AM
   Guaiac positive stools:  Most likely etiology is her known crohn's
   disease, but in this setting also concerned for ischemic colitis,
   ulcers, other etiologies of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Patient
   refusing NGT.  Hematocrit currently stable. Port for access, currently
   unable to obtain additional peripherals.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, ileostomy, and short gut syndrome. She presents to the ICU with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and leukocytosis. Her abdominal pain developed shortly after ERCP and is concerning for stent occlusion or accumulation of sludge. Other potential etiologies of her abdominal pain include ischemic bowel, obstruction, perforation, abscess, and biliary/peritoneal fistula. Her bilirubin is elevated, and she has guaiac-positive stools.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Stent occlusion or accumulation of sludge: This could lead to further complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or abscess.
2. Ischemic bowel: This could lead to bowel necrosis, perforation, or abscess.
3. Obstruction: This could lead to bowel perforation, abscess, or necrosis.
4. Perforation: This could lead to peritonitis, abscess, or sepsis.
5. Abscess: This could lead to sepsis, abscess rupture, or fistula formation.
6. Biliary/peritoneal fistula: This could lead to sepsis, abscess, or fistula rupture.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, which could lead to bleeding complications.
8. Consumptive coagulopathy: This could lead to bleeding complications or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
9. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's guaiac-positive stools could lead to bleeding complications or anemia.
10. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and bilirubin could lead to sepsis.

Plan:

1. Trend LFTs, WBC, and lactate levels to monitor for worsening liver function and sepsis.
2. Perform a CT scan with IV contrast to evaluate for bowel obstruction, perforation, or abscess.
3. Broaden antibiotic coverage if the patient's clinical presentation worsens.
4. Monitor INR and consider transfusing fresh frozen plasma (FFP) if necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis.
   RUQ PAIN
 concern for hepatobiliary disease, most concern for
   cholodocholithiasis or biliary leak (recent percutaneous drain),
   obstructed biliary stents.  Also consider intraabdominal abcess
   (multiple prior surgeries) or bowel ischemia.  No evidence for
   peritonitis or concern for bowel perforation.  Presence of coagulopathy
   and guiac + stool concerning for bowel ishcemia, and lipase elevated
   although HCO3 WNL.  Possible acute pancreatitis.  ABD CT does not
   demonstrate acute pathology (but limited study).  Plan monitor serial
   abd exam, iv fluids, empirical antimicrobials, ERCP team to evaluate
   --> ERCP today.  General Surgery to continue to follow.
   TACHYCARDIA -- persistent, suspect multifactorial including pain,
   anxiety and hypovolemia.  Monitor.  Replete iv fluid boluses.
   ELEVATED WBC -- increasing.  Concern for localized infection, likely
   biliary source.  Monitor.
   SEPSIS --  SIRS with likely intraabdominal infectious source.  Continue
   volume resussitation.  [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from central line placement for
   monitoring CVP and SvO2.  Await culture results.
   COAGULOPATHY
 corrected INR with vit K, FFP.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia. Replete with iv fluids, monitor I/O.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- preserved.  Monitor urine output, BUN, creat.
   LFT ABNORMALITY
  concern for biliary obstruction.  Monitor serial
   LFTs, amylase, lipase.  ABD CT scan.
   HTN
 likely due to pain.  Now better controlled with optimized pain
   mangement.  Monitor BP.
   CROHNS -- initiate steroids, consult GI service to assist in
   management.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 short gut syndrome.  TPN.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.9°F)
* Heart rate: 123 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 138/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* White blood cell count: 20.1 K/uL

The patient has a history of abdominal pain, which is currently improved with morphine and dilaudid. They also have hypertension, which is likely due to pain, and are receiving hydralazine as needed.

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Abdominal tenderness and guarding
* Right lower extremity edema: trace
* Left lower extremity edema: trace
* Skin: warm, no rash or jaundice
* Neurologic: attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place, and time, and has purposeful movement.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 326 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 141 mg/dL
* Lactate: 11 mg/dL
* Amylase: 90 IU/L
* Lipase: 23 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.8 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Sepsis: monitor serial abdominal exam, IV fluids, empirical antimicrobials, and ERCP team evaluation
* RUQ pain: concern for hepatobiliary disease, most likely cholodocholithiasis or biliary leak, obstructed biliary stents, or intraabdominal abscess
* Tachycardia: suspect multifactorial including pain, anxiety, and hypovolemia, monitor and replete IV fluid boluses
* Elevated WBC: concern for localized infection, likely biliary source, monitor
* Coagulopathy: corrected INR with vitamin K and FFP, monitor
* Fluids: hypovolemia, replete with IV fluids and monitor I/O
* Renal function: preserved, monitor urine output, BUN, and creatinine
* LFT abnormality: concern for biliary obstruction, monitor serial LFTs, amylase, and lipase, and consider ABD CT scan
* HTN: likely due to pain, now better controlled with optimized pain management, monitor BP
* Crohn's disease: initiate steroids and consult GI service to assist in management
* Nutritional support: short gut syndrome, consider TPN

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Biliary obstruction or leak
* Intraabdominal abscess
* Bowel ischemia or necrosis
* Sepsis or septic shock
* Coagulopathy or bleeding
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury
* Liver dysfunction or failure
* Pancreatitis or acute pancreatitis
* Crohn's disease exacerbation or complications

The patient's treatment plan should focus on managing their sepsis, abdominal pain, and potential complications, as well as optimizing their nutritional support and addressing their coagulopathy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Sepsis.
   RUQ PAIN
 concern for hepatobiliary disease, most concern for
   cholodocholithiasis or biliary leak (recent percutaneous drain),
   obstructed biliary stents.  Also consider intraabdominal abcess
   (multiple prior surgeries) or bowel ischemia.  No evidence for
   peritonitis or concern for bowel perforation.  Presence of coagulopathy
   and guiac + stool concerning for bowel ishcemia, and lipase elevated
   although HCO3 WNL.  Possible acute pancreatitis.  ABD CT does not
   demonstrate acute pathology (but limited study).  Plan monitor serial
   abd exam, iv fluids, empirical antimicrobials, ERCP team to evaluate
   --> ERCP today.  General Surgery to continue to follow.
   TACHYCARDIA -- persistent, suspect multifactorial including pain,
   anxiety and hypovolemia.  Monitor.  Replete iv fluid boluses.
   ELEVATED WBC -- increasing.  Concern for localized infection, likely
   biliary source.  Monitor.
   SEPSIS --  SIRS with likely intraabdominal infectious source.  Continue
   volume resussitation.  [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from central line placement for
   monitoring CVP and SvO2.  Await culture results.
   COAGULOPATHY
 corrected INR with vit K, FFP.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia. Replete with iv fluids, monitor I/O.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- preserved.  Monitor urine output, BUN, creat.
   LFT ABNORMALITY
  concern for biliary obstruction.  Monitor serial
   LFTs, amylase, lipase.  ABD CT scan.
   HTN
 likely due to pain.  Now better controlled with optimized pain
   mangement.  Monitor BP.
   CROHNS -- initiate steroids, consult GI service to assist in
   management.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 short gut syndrome.  TPN.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has been experiencing abdominal pain, which has improved with morphine and dilaudid. They have also required one dose of hydralazine overnight for hypertension and remain tachycardic. The patient's medical history is significant for Crohn's disease, and they have undergone multiple surgeries. The patient is currently receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and pain management.

Assessment:

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient's temperature is elevated, and they have a tachycardia, which suggests a systemic inflammatory response. The patient's white blood cell count is also elevated, which may indicate a localized infection.
2. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is a concern, as it may be related to a variety of conditions, including cholangitis, pancreatitis, or intra-abdominal abscess.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged international normalized ratio (INR), which may indicate a bleeding disorder.
4. Hypovolemia: The patient's blood pressure is low, and they have a tachycardia, which may indicate hypovolemia.
5. Renal function: The patient's creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are within normal limits, but the patient is at risk for renal impairment due to their underlying medical conditions and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
6. Nutritional support: The patient has a short gut syndrome and requires total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
7. Cardiovascular status: The patient has hypertension, which may be related to pain, anxiety, and hypovolemia.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure.
2. Administer IV fluids and antibiotics as prescribed.
3. Monitor the patient's abdominal pain and adjust pain management as needed.
4. Consider ERCP to evaluate the patient's biliary system and rule out cholangitis or pancreatitis.
5. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and adjust INR as necessary.
6. Replete the patient's hypovolemia with IV fluids and monitor I/O.
7. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medications as necessary.
8. Provide nutritional support with TPN.
9. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust medications as necessary.

Potential complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Abdominal complications: The patient's abdominal pain may be related to a variety of conditions, including cholangitis, pancreatitis, or intra-abdominal abscess, which can lead to organ failure and death.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may lead to bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Hypovolemia: The patient's hypovolemia may lead to organ failure and death.
5. Renal impairment: The patient's underlying medical conditions and the use of nephrotoxic medications may lead to renal impairment.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's short gut syndrome may lead to nutritional deficiencies, including malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension may lead to cardiovascular complications, including heart failure and arrhythmias."

   67 year old female with a history of crohn's disease s/p multiple
   abdominal surgeries with ileostomy and short gut syndrome,
   cholecystitis s/p open cholecystostomy tube in [**Month (only) 807**] and ERCP with stent
   placement on [**2135-9-30**] who presents from home with worsening abdominal
   pain and nausea.
   Respiratory Failure
 Patient was intubated for ERCP yesterday.  Plan
   to extubate once pain control and agitation are better controlled.
   Patient is hypertensive this morning likely due to agitation
   - extubate today once pain under control and patient is less
   hypertensive
   - hydralazine IV x 1 to control hypertension
   Abdominal Pain/Leukocytosis:  T bili elevated this AM, 4.8
 8.9.  ERCP
   was notified, they are of the opinion that she likely clotted again,
   but they want to wait until after she
s stopped bleeding before they
   repeat ERCP.
   - fractionate bili
   - trend LFTs, WBC, lactate
   - plan for ERCP first thing this AM
   - surgical team co-managing
   - vancomycin and unasyn for now, if worsening clinical presentation
   will broaden to zosyn
   - f/u culture data
   - zofran, compazine and morphine for pain and nausea
   - NPO, LR @ 100 cc/hr, with boluses to maintain pressures and relieve
   tachycardia
   Coagulopathy:  Patient with INR of 2.0 on presentation.  Unclear
   etiology.  She has been as high as 1.6 in the past.  Most likely
   etiology is nutritional deficiencies but in this setting must be
   concerned for consumptive coagulopathy (less likely given normal
   platelet count). She has received 5 mg IV vitamin K and one unit of
   FFP, INR 1.3 today.  DIC labs are not concerning.
   - monitor INR daily
   Guaiac positive stools:  Most likely etiology is her known crohn's
   disease, but in this setting also concerned for ischemic colitis,
   ulcers, other etiologies of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Patient
   refusing NGT.  Hematocrit currently stable. Port for access, currently
   unable to obtain additional peripherals.
   - active type and screen
   - port for access
   - hematocrits [**Hospital1 7**]
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - surgical team following
   Crohn's disease:  As above, s/p multiple surgeries with ileostomy with
   short gut syndrome.  Currently can't take PO medications.  Will need to
   address with gastroenterology and surgery management if she continues
   to be unable to take POs.
   - consult GI regarding steroid dosing and restarting 5-ASA

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 Patient was intubated for ERCP yesterday.  Plan
   to extubate once pain control and agitation are better controlled.
   Patient is hypertensive this morning likely due to agitation
   - extubate today once pain under control and patient is less

Based on the provided progress note, I have summarized the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, cholecystitis, and multiple abdominal surgeries, was admitted to the ICU after undergoing ERCP with stent placement. The patient presented with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and respiratory failure. She was intubated for ERCP and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 105/46 mmHg. Her respiratory status is improving, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL. Her coagulation profile is abnormal, with an INR of 1.3. Her liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an ALT level of 92 IU/L and an AST level of 100 IU/L.

The patient's abdominal pain is managed with morphine and zofran, and she is receiving vancomycin and una-syn for infection prophylaxis. Her gastrointestinal bleeding is being monitored, and she is receiving IV vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma to correct her coagulopathy.

The patient's short gut syndrome is being managed with total parenteral nutrition, and she is receiving prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy. Her electrolyte levels are being closely monitored, and she is receiving IV fluids to maintain hydration.

The patient's code status is full code, and she is being followed by the surgical team. The plan is to extubate her once her pain control and agitation are better controlled.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she is still receiving mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of respiratory failure if her respiratory status deteriorates.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, and she is at risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of her coagulation profile is necessary to prevent bleeding complications.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is being monitored, and there is a risk of further bleeding complications if not managed properly.
4. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics for infection prophylaxis, but there is a risk of infection if not managed properly.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's short gut syndrome is being managed with total parenteral nutrition, but there is a risk of electrolyte imbalance if not managed properly.
6. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of sepsis if her infection is not managed properly.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she is at risk of various medical complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent these complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 .H/O CHOLECYSTITIS, CALCULOUS
 .H/O CROHN'S DISEASE (REGIONAL ENTERITIS)
   67 year old female with a history of crohn's disease s/p multiple
   abdominal surgeries with ileostomy and short gut syndrome,
   cholecystitis s/p open cholecystostomy tube in [**Month (only) 807**] and ERCP with stent
   placement on [**2135-9-30**] who presents from home with worsening abdominal
   pain and nausea.
   Abdominal Pain/Leukocytosis:  Patient currently with diffuse abdominal
   pain, leukocytosis with left shift, and rising LFTS.  Pain developed
   shortly after recent ERCP which is concerning for stent occlusion or
   accumulation of sludge.  Other potential etiologies of her abdominal
   pain include ischemic bowel given diffuse pain with soft abdomen and
   guaiac positive stools, obstruction (less likely given exam),
   perforation, abscess, biliary/peritoneal fistula. Right upper quadrant
   ultrasound with 13 mm CBD.  CT scan showed distended gallbladder with
   gallstones.  WBC count and bilirubin rising.
   - trend LFTs, WBC, lactate
   - plan for ERCP first thing this AM
   - surgical team co-managing
   - vancomycin and unasyn for now, if worsening clinical presentation
   will broaden to zosyn
   - zofran, compazine and morphine for pain and nausea
   - NPO, LR @ 150 cc/hr, with boluses to maintain pressures and relieve
   tachycardia
   - if tachycardia does not resolve after ERCP, low threshold for placing
   central line and monitoring CVP
   - follow blood, urine cultures from the emergency room
   Coagulopathy:  Patient with INR of 2.0 on presentation.  Unclear
   etiology.  She has been as high as 1.6 in the past.  Most likely
   etiology is nutritional deficiencies but in this setting must be
   concerned for consumptive coagulopathy (less likely given normal
   platelet count). She has received 5 mg IV vitamin K and one unit of
   FFP.
   - DIC labs not concerning
   - monitor INR
   Guaiac positive stools:  Most likely etiology is her known crohn's
   disease, but in this setting also concerned for ischemic colitis,
   ulcers, other etiologies of gastrointestinal bleeding.  Patient
   refusing NGT.  Hematocrit currently stable. Port for access, currently
   unable to obtain additional peripherals.
   - active type and screen
   - port for access
   - hematocrits [**Hospital1 7**]
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 7**]
   - surgical team following
   Crohn's disease:  As above, s/p multiple surgeries with ileostomy with
   short gut syndrome.  Currently can't take PO medications.  Will need to
   address with gastroenterology and surgery management if she continues
   to be unable to take POs.
   - start stress dose IV steroids as pt unable to continue taking POs
   - will discuss with GI about restarting home 5-ASA
   - close monitoring of electrolytes ([**Hospital1 7**] lytes) given short gut syndrome

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, and short gut syndrome. She was admitted to the ICU with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and leukocytosis.

The patient underwent ERCP on [**2135-10-7**] 10:00 AM, during which 2 plastic stents were removed, and large blood clots were extracted. Fresh blood was seen oozing from the ampulla, and the patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) to achieve a hemoglobin concentration of >25.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 105/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's abdominal pain is concerning for stent occlusion or accumulation of sludge, and other potential etiologies include ischemic bowel, obstruction, perforation, abscess, and biliary/peritoneal fistula. Her WBC count and bilirubin are rising, and she has guaiac-positive stools.

The patient's coagulopathy is concerning, with an INR of 2.0 on presentation. The most likely etiology is nutritional deficiencies, but in this setting, consumptive coagulopathy cannot be ruled out.

The patient's Crohn's disease is being managed with IV steroids, and her short gut syndrome requires close monitoring of electrolytes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemorrhage: The patient's fresh blood oozing from the ampulla during ERCP and her guaiac-positive stools suggest ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Sepsis: The patient's rising WBC count and bilirubin suggest potential sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR of 2.0 and consumptive coagulopathy can lead to bleeding and hematoma formation.
4. Ischemic bowel: The patient's diffuse abdominal pain and guaiac-positive stools suggest potential ischemic bowel, which can lead to bowel necrosis and perforation.
5. Obstruction: The patient's abdominal pain and rising bilirubin suggest potential obstruction, which can lead to bowel ischemia and perforation.
6. Perforation: The patient's abdominal pain and rising bilirubin suggest potential perforation, which can lead to peritonitis and sepsis.
7. Abscess: The patient's abdominal pain and rising bilirubin suggest potential abscess, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
8. Biliary/peritoneal fistula: The patient's abdominal pain and rising bilirubin suggest potential biliary/peritoneal fistula, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, and laboratory results to identify any potential complications early and initiate prompt interventions to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis, who underwent ERCP with stent removal and extraction of large clots from the biliary tree. The patient remains intubated and is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and ampicillin/sulbactam. The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, cholecystitis, and calculus, and has undergone multiple surgeries.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

* Biliary obstruction due to stones and clot from biliary trauma/bleeding
* Anemia
* Pain control issues
* Coagulopathy
* RUQ pain and concern for hepatobiliary disease, including cholangitis, biliary leak, or obstructed biliary stents
* Elevated WBC count and concern for localized infection
* Sepsis with likely intraabdominal infectious source
* Respiratory failure requiring intubation
* Tachycardia
* Elevated LFTs and concern for biliary obstruction
* Renal function is preserved, but urine output and BUN/Creat levels should be monitored
* Hypertension and tachycardia related to pain and agitation

Potential medical complications:

1. Biliary obstruction and cholangitis
2. Intraabdominal abscess or bowel ischemia
3. Acute pancreatitis
4. Coagulopathy and bleeding complications
5. Sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction
6. Respiratory failure and prolonged intubation
7. Cardiac arrhythmias and hypotension
8. Renal failure and electrolyte imbalances
9. Malnutrition and short gut syndrome
10. Infection and sepsis in the context of immunosuppression and chronic disease

Plan:

1. Continue antibiotics and monitor for clinical response
2. Broaden antibiotics if clinical decline
3. Monitor serial LFTs, amylase, and lipase
4. Consider ERCP team evaluation and possible stent replacement
5. Monitor for signs of sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction
6. Optimize pain management and sedation
7. Monitor for bleeding complications and coagulopathy
8. Continue stress steroids and consult GI service for management of Crohn's disease
9. Start maintenance IV fluids and monitor for signs of malnutrition
10. Monitor for signs of respiratory failure and consider extubation planning."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with Crohn's disease, short gut syndrome, and a history of cholelithiasis, who presented with pre-sepsis in the setting of recurrent biliary obstruction. She underwent ERCP with evidence of clot and bleeding from the biliary tree, and remains intubated post-ERCP. The patient's issues include biliary obstruction, leukocytosis, blood loss anemia, respiratory failure, tachycardia, and Crohn's disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent Biliary Obstruction: The patient's bilirubin levels are increasing, which may indicate recurrent obstruction due to clot formation. This could lead to further complications such as sepsis, liver failure, and pancreatitis.
2. Bleeding from Biliary Tree: The patient's bleeding from the biliary tree may continue to cause anemia, which could worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of cardiac complications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen due to her continued intubation and the potential for further bleeding from the biliary tree.
4. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen due to the ongoing biliary obstruction and bleeding, which could lead to multi-organ failure.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen due to her ongoing bleeding and the potential for further clot formation.
6. Hypovolemia: The patient's hypovolemia may worsen due to her ongoing bleeding and the potential for further fluid losses.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen due to her ongoing tachycardia and the potential for further fluid overload.
8. Crohn's Disease Flare: The patient's Crohn's disease may worsen due to the ongoing stress and inflammation, which could lead to further complications such as bowel perforation and peritonitis.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, multiple abdominal surgeries, ileostomy, and short gut syndrome. She was recently admitted to the ICU for treatment of bacteremia, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* T: 37.1°C (98.7°F)
* HR: 71 bpm
* BP: 114/54 mmHg
* RR: 13 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 97% on room air

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 27-29 cells/μL (elevated)
* Hct: 30.9% (stable)
* Plt: 233,000 cells/μL (stable)
* Cr: 0.9 mg/dL (stable)
* TCO2: 28 mmHg (stable)
* Glucose: 121 mg/dL (stable)
* ALT/AST: 86/80 IU/L (unchanged)
* Alk Phos: 344 IU/L (increased)
* T Bili: 4.8 mg/dL (decreased)
* Ca++: 7.4 mg/dL (stable)
* Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL (stable)
* PO4: 2.8 mg/dL (stable)

The patient has a Port-a-Cath in place for 9 years, which is a potential source of infection. She has a history of cholecystitis and has undergone multiple surgeries, including ERCP with stent placement.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Bacteremia: The patient has a confirmed case of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, which is being treated with Zosyn.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, which may be related to the bacteremia or another underlying condition.
3. Abdominal pain: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease and has undergone multiple surgeries, which may be contributing to her abdominal pain.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR, which may be related to nutritional deficiencies or consumptive coagulopathy.
5. Guaiac-positive stools: The patient has guaiac-positive stools, which may be related to her Crohn's disease or ischemic colitis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Surveillance cultures to monitor for bacterial growth and to guide antibiotic therapy.
2. Repeat ERCP once bleeding has stopped to evaluate the stent and to assess for any potential complications.
3. Tapering of steroids to IV equivalent of home dose to manage Crohn's disease.
4. Daily electrolyte monitoring to manage short gut syndrome.
5. Monitoring of INR and platelet count to assess for coagulopathy.
6. Active type and screen to prepare for potential surgical procedures.
7. IV PPI to manage gastric acid production and to reduce the risk of bleeding.
8. Surgical team following to manage the patient's abdominal pain and to assess for potential complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address her multiple medical complications and to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   [**10-8**]
   -Extubated today - pt refused post extubation ABG. Mentating well, SaO2
   95% NC, denies SOB.
   .
   - WBC elevated yesterday afternoon to 27-29. Entire CBC was elevated.
   At 1AM labs, counts were more consistent with yesterday AM. Etiology
   still unclear.
   .
   CBC increased -> most likely pre-renal as all counts up; leukocytosis
   may be due to steroids, C. diff; given IVF at 150cc/hr and urine lytes
   sent (forgot to get Cr!), C. diff sent.
   -Surgery: no recs
   -ERCP: repeat ERCP when bleeding stops. Today, LFTs looking better, can
   do stent tmrw [**10-9**] if pt looks like she has biliary sepsis given
   elevated WBC to 29. But, pt afebrile, comfortable, mentating well.
   -
   -Tachycardic/hypertensive - did not respond to fluids; gave 5mg IV
   metoprolol with SBP 130s and HR 80s. [**Month (only) 51**] have been due to rebound from
   holding BB.
   .
   -Steroids: unclear if started by endo for adrenal insufficiency vs GI
   for Crohn's dz.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, short gut syndrome, and multiple abdominal surgeries. She was admitted to the ICU with worsening abdominal pain and nausea. She was extubated yesterday and is currently on non-invasive ventilation (NC) without desaturations. Her WBC count is elevated, and she has leukocytosis, but she is afebrile and her RR and HR are normal. She has been started on IV antibiotics, and her ERCP was delayed due to ongoing bleeding. Her INR is 1.3, and she has received vitamin K and FFP. Her stool output is guaiac-positive, and she is being monitored for potential gastrointestinal bleeding. She is also being managed for coagulopathy, and her electrolytes are being closely monitored due to her short gut syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she may require further respiratory support if her condition worsens.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has leukocytosis and is at risk for bacteremia, especially with Pseudonomas. Antibiotics have been started, but she may require further coverage with ciprofloxacin.
3. Abdominal Pain/Leukocytosis: The patient's abdominal pain and leukocytosis may be related to her Crohn's disease or other gastrointestinal issues. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the cause and best course of treatment.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, and she may be at risk for bleeding or thrombosis. Further monitoring and management are needed to ensure her coagulation status remains stable.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's guaiac-positive stool output is a concern, and she may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the cause and best course of treatment.
6. Short Gut Syndrome: The patient's short gut syndrome may lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring and management are needed to ensure her nutritional and electrolyte status remain stable.
7. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and leukocytosis may indicate the presence of sepsis. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine if sepsis is present and to ensure her condition is being managed appropriately."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, short gut syndrome, and cholelithiasis, who was admitted with biliary obstruction and sepsis. The patient underwent repeat ERCP with evidence of clot and bleeding from the biliary tree.

The patient's current condition is:

* Leukocytosis with a WBC count of 233 K/uL
* Blood loss anemia with a Hct of 26.4%
* GNR/staph bacteremia
* Tachycardia and hypertension
* Elevated bilirubin levels
* Coagulopathy
* Possible nutritional deficiency due to short gut syndrome

The patient is currently receiving antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn) and is awaiting sensitivities. The plan is to continue antibiotics and monitor for clinical decline. The patient's bilirubin levels are decreasing slowly, and the plan is to repeat ERCP and possibly replace the stent once bleeding has stabilized.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to ongoing bacteremia
* Hemorrhagic complications due to bleeding from the biliary tree
* Coagulopathy and bleeding due to low platelet count and prolonged PT/PTT
* Malnutrition and malabsorption due to short gut syndrome
* Adrenal insufficiency due to steroid tapering
* Worsening of Crohn's disease and potential complications such as bowel perforation or obstruction
* Infection of the indwelling port (PortaCath)

The patient's current medications include:

* Metoprolol (beta blocker)
* Morphine sulfate (pain medication)
* Vancomycin and zosyn (antibiotics)
* Hydrocortisone (steroid)

The patient's plan includes:

* Continued antibiotics and monitoring for clinical decline
* Repeat ERCP and possible stent replacement once bleeding has stabilized
* Tapering of hydrocortisone to IV equivalent of home steroid dose while NPO
* Maintenance IV fluids while NPO for procedure
* Co-management with surgical team
* Consideration for transfer to floor service

The patient's code status is full code."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, short gut syndrome, and cholelithiasis, who presented with sepsis and biliary obstruction. She had a repeat ERCP with evidence of clot and bleeding from the biliary tree. The patient's issues include biliary obstruction, leukocytosis, blood loss anemia, GNR/staph bacteremia, and Crohn's disease. She is currently on vancomycin and zosyn, and awaiting sensitivities. The patient's bilirubin is slowly decreasing, and her WBC remains elevated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's WBC is elevated, and she has a GNR/staph bacteremia, which may indicate an ongoing infection.
2. Biliary obstruction: The patient's biliary obstruction may persist or worsen, leading to further complications such as cholangitis or pancreatitis.
3. Blood loss anemia: The patient's blood loss anemia may worsen if she continues to bleed from the biliary tree or if she develops further complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may persist or worsen, leading to bleeding complications.
5. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has a history of adrenal insufficiency, which may be exacerbated by the stress of her current illness.
6. Short gut syndrome: The patient's short gut syndrome may lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances, which may worsen her overall condition.
7. Cholelithiasis: The patient's cholelithiasis may worsen if she does not receive proper treatment for her biliary obstruction.
8. Pancreatitis: The patient may develop pancreatitis if her biliary obstruction persists or worsens.
9. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen if she does not receive proper treatment for her infection.
10. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if she develops further complications such as pneumonia or respiratory failure."
