   Imaging: CXR AP [**2127-1-14**]:
   FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
   sitting semi-upright position. Available for comparison is a preceding
   similar study dated [**2126-8-1**]. There is no evidence of
   significant
   cardiac enlargement on this portable chest view. The pulmonary
   vasculature is not congested. Thin plate atelectasis exists bilaterally
   on the bases,
   however, no evidence of acute infiltrates is present and the pulmonary
   vasculature is not congested. No pneumothorax is identified in the
   apical
   area. In the upper abdominal area, bilateral pigtail catheters are
   overlying
   the renal areas indicating bilateral pelvic nephrostomy. These tubes
   were
   present earlier on examination of [**2126-8-1**].
   IMPRESSION: No evidence of new pneumothorax status post subclavian line
   placement.
   [**2127-1-1**] Change nephrostomy/pylostomy tube - IMPRESSION:
   1. Bilateral occluded nephrostomy tubes.
   2. Using multiple wires, the occlusions were broken through and access
   gained into both kidneys.
   3. Left 8 French nephrostomy tube exchange.
   4. Right upsized from 8 French to 10 French nephrostomy tube.
   5. Bilateral nephrostograms demonstrating bilateral pelvic and ureteral
   stones as previously seen. Contrast does flow to the urinary bladder
   easily on the left side; however, is held up in the distal ureter on
   the right side.

   Assessment and Plan
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ANXIETY
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 CHRONIC PAIN
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   61F with MS, history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and
   bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension
   following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.
   # Hypotension/septic shock.  Septic shock most likely cause of
   hypotension given previous history of severe infections, intraop
   manipulation, fever, leukocytosis/bandemia.  Suspect UTI leading to
   bacteremic event.  Less likely infectious possibilities include
   wounds/decubs but these appear clean, pneumonia, GI/C.diff.  Cultures
   checked but all after gent and zosyn.  Less likely cardiac
   ischemia/cardiogenic shock (though elevated enzymes more likely demand;
   no ECG changes), bleed (but low suspicion), pericardial
   effusion/tamponade (lower volts on ECG, though no reason for
   effusion/tamponade to be present), obstructive/PE (again less likely),
   adrenal insufficiency (anesthesia concern given use of etomidate but
   random [**Last Name (un) **] in 30s).  Overwhelmingly seems to be sepsis in etiology.
   - Antibiotics: meropenem (given PCN allergy) and gent for double
   coverage given strong possibility of pseudomonads, also vanc (no
   history of VRE known) for h/o MRSA.
   - f/u bloods and send urines from various sites.
   - f/u urology recs re: any other imaging for abscess etc.
   - C.diff if any diarrhea.
   - Monitor decubs - no active infection evident currently.
   - Check TTE
   - PM Hct to r/o bleed
   - Trend lactates, CEs
   - Pressors: now on norepinephrine
   - consider PICC when afebrile
   - Add on cortisol and stim in AM.
   - Consider stress dose steroids if poor response to stim.
   # Leaking from G tube
   - G- tube to gravity
   - consider surgery
   - may need further imaging
   LEUKOCYTOSIS
   No evidence of new infection.
   - f/u cultures
   - check stool for cdiff
   ELEVATED INR
   Went from 1.1-1.4
   - check DIC labs
   # Nephrolithiasis s/p perc neph tubes.  ALso neurogenic bladder with
   foley.
   - f/u urology recs.
   - change indwelling foley given infection.
   # NSTEMI.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension.  No ischemic ECG
   changes. Troponin peaked at 0.53. Now trending down.
   - Continue to trend.
   - f/u TTE
   - No further intervention for now, consider statin
   # MS.  Painful UEs and now bedbound
   - IV pain meds for now given poor GI absorption
   - when taking POs, continue home pain, anxiety regimen.
   # Sacral decubs.
   - wound care consult.
   # Depression - home meds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who was admitted to the ICU following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. She developed hypotension and is suspected to have septic shock. She has a fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, and her blood cultures are pending. She has a history of severe infections, intraop manipulation, and leukocytosis/bandemia, which may have contributed to her current condition.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, fever, and leukocytosis/bandemia are consistent with sepsis. She is at risk for further complications, including organ dysfunction, and may require aggressive treatment with antibiotics and vasopressors.
2. UTI: The patient's history of urosepsis and bilateral nephrolithiasis increases her risk of developing a UTI. She should be monitored for signs of infection, such as fever, chills, and flank pain.
3. Nephrolithiasis: The patient's bilateral nephrolithiasis may cause further complications, including obstructive nephropathy and chronic kidney disease.
4. Neurogenic bladder: The patient's neurogenic bladder may cause urinary retention, which could lead to further complications, such as UTI and kidney damage.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be related to blood loss or chronic kidney disease.
6. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain may be exacerbated by her current condition and may require further management.
7. Sacral decubitus: The patient's sacral decubitus may lead to further complications, including pressure ulcers and skin breakdown.
8. Depression: The patient's depression may be exacerbated by her current condition and may require further management.
9. NSTEMI: The patient's NSTEMI may have been caused by demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension. She should be monitored for signs of cardiac ischemia, such as chest pain and ST segment changes.
10. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be related to infection or inflammation. She should be monitored for signs of infection, such as fever and chills.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to assess the progression of her condition.
2. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and vasopressors as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's urinary output and urine cultures to assess for signs of UTI.
4. Monitor the patient's kidney function and consider further imaging to assess for nephrolithiasis.
5. Consider further management of the patient's chronic pain and depression.
6. Monitor the patient's sacral decubitus and consider further wound care consults.
7. Monitor the patient's NSTEMI and consider further management with medications such as statins.
8. Monitor the patient's leukocytosis and consider further evaluation to determine the cause of the increase in white blood cells."

   FINDINGS: AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
   sitting semi-upright position. Available for comparison is a preceding
   similar study dated [**2126-8-1**]. There is no evidence of
   significant
   cardiac enlargement on this portable chest view. The pulmonary
   vasculature is not congested. Thin plate atelectasis exists bilaterally
   on the bases,
   however, no evidence of acute infiltrates is present and the pulmonary
   vasculature is not congested. No pneumothorax is identified in the
   apical
   area. In the upper abdominal area, bilateral pigtail catheters are
   overlying
   the renal areas indicating bilateral pelvic nephrostomy. These tubes
   were
   present earlier on examination of [**2126-8-1**].
   IMPRESSION: No evidence of new pneumothorax status post subclavian line
   placement.
   [**2127-1-1**] Change nephrostomy/pylostomy tube - IMPRESSION:
   1. Bilateral occluded nephrostomy tubes.
   2. Using multiple wires, the occlusions were broken through and access
   gained into both kidneys.
   3. Left 8 French nephrostomy tube exchange.
   4. Right upsized from 8 French to 10 French nephrostomy tube.
   5. Bilateral nephrostograms demonstrating bilateral pelvic and ureteral
   stones as previously seen. Contrast does flow to the urinary bladder
   easily on the left side; however, is held up in the distal ureter on
   the right side.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   vasculature is not congested. Thin plate atelectasis exists bilaterally
   on the bases,
   however, no evidence of acute infiltrates is present and the pulmonary
   vasculature is not congested. No pneumothorax is identified in the
   apical
   area. In the upper abdominal area, bilateral pigtail catheters are
   overlying
   the renal areas indicating bilateral pelvic nephrostomy. These tubes
   were
   present earlier on examination of [**2126-8-1**].
   IMPRESSION: No evidence of new pneumothorax status post subclavian line

   following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.
   # Hypotension/septic shock.  Septic shock most likely cause of
   hypotension given previous history of severe infections, intraop
   manipulation, fever, leukocytosis/bandemia.  Suspect UTI leading to
   bacteremic event.  Less likely infectious possibilities include
   wounds/decubs but these appear clean, pneumonia, GI/C.diff.  Cultures
   checked but all after gent and zosyn.  Less likely cardiac
   ischemia/cardiogenic shock (though elevated enzymes more likely demand;
   no ECG changes), bleed (but low suspicion), pericardial
   effusion/tamponade (lower volts on ECG, though no reason for
   effusion/tamponade to be present), obstructive/PE (again less likely),
   adrenal insufficiency (anesthesia concern given use of etomidate but
   random [**Last Name (un) **] in 30s).  Overwhelmingly seems to be sepsis in etiology.
   - Antibiotics: meropenem (given PCN allergy) and gent for double

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presented with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Hypotension and septic shock, likely caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI) leading to bacteremic event.
2. Fever, leukocytosis, and bandemia, which are consistent with sepsis.
3. Impaired skin integrity, likely due to decubitus ulcers.
4. Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss and hemorrhage.
5. Chronic pain, likely related to multiple sclerosis.
6. Leukocytosis, with no evidence of new infection.
7. Elevated INR, which may be related to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
8. Nephrolithiasis, with bilateral pelvic and ureteral stones.
9. Neurogenic bladder with a Foley catheter.
10. NSTEMI, likely related to demand in the setting of hypotension.

The patient is receiving antibiotics for sepsis, including meropenem and gentamicin, as well as vancomycin for MRSA prophylaxis. The patient is also receiving norepinephrine for blood pressure support.

The potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis progression, including septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction.
2. Development of secondary infections, such as pneumonia, wound infections, or gastrointestinal infections.
3. Bleeding complications, including hemorrhage or hematemesis.
4. Cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
5. Renal complications, including acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Neurological complications, including increased intracranial pressure, seizures, or stroke.
7. Gastrointestinal complications, including nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Psychological complications, including anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continued antibiotic therapy for sepsis.
2. Monitoring of vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
3. Daily assessment of skin integrity and wound care.
4. Pain management, including IV pain medications and home pain regimen.
5. Nutritional support, including tube feeds and PO.
6. Glycemic control, including blood glucose monitoring and insulin therapy as needed.
7. Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.
8. VAP prevention measures.
9. Follow-up with urology and other specialists as needed.
10. Consultation with a wound care specialist and a social worker for support and counseling."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a post-operative urologic procedure admission who developed post-operative hypotension and concern for septic shock. The patient is currently in the ICU, receiving multiple medications and treatments.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 101.6°F (38.7°C)
* Heart rate: 114 bpm
* Blood pressure: 110/57 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.2-36.5 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 38.3-37.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 335-272 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.53 ng/mL
* Glucose: 118-101 mg/dL

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypotension are concerning for sepsis.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating acute anemia secondary to blood loss.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin is not assessed, but the presence of thin plate atelectasis on the chest X-ray may indicate impaired skin integrity.
4. Chronic pain: The patient's history of chronic pain is not specified, but the presence of anxiety and acute anemia may exacerbate this condition.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%, which may indicate mild respiratory distress.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is 110/57 mmHg, which may indicate cardiovascular instability.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's platelet count is low, which may indicate coagulopathy.
8. Infection: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the presence of sepsis may indicate infection.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continued antibiotic therapy for suspected sepsis
2. Aggressive fluid resuscitation to maintain blood pressure
3. Pain management to address chronic pain and anxiety
4. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results to detect any changes in the patient's condition
5. Consideration of additional diagnostic tests, such as echocardiogram or computed tomography (CT) scan, to evaluate the patient's cardiac and respiratory status."

 61F with MS, history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and
   bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension
   following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.
   .
   # Hypotension/septic shock.  Septic shock most likely cause of
   hypotension given previous history of severe infections, intraop
   manipulation, fever, leukocytosis/bandemia.  Suspect UTI leading to
   bacteremic event.  Other infectious possibilities include
   wounds/decubs, pneumonia, GI/C.diff.  Cultures checked but all after
   gent and zosyn.  Other possibilities for hypotension include cardiac
   ischemia/cardiogenic shock (though elevated enzymes more likely demand;
   no ECG changes), bleed, pericardial effusion/tamponade (lower volts on
   ECG, though no reason for effusion/tamponade to be present),
   obstructive/PE (again less likely), adrenal insufficiency (anesthesia
   concern given use of etomidate).  Overwhelmingly seems to be sepsis in
   etiology.
   - f/u bloods and send urines from various sites.
   - f/u urology recs re: any other imaging for abscess etc.
   - C.diff if any diarrhea.
   - Monitor decubs - no active infection evident currently.
   - trend CEs and ECGs.  Check TTE in AM.
   - PM Hct.
   - Add on cortisol and stim in AM.
   - Check cVO2 sat; consider tfusion/inos if low.
   - Trend lactates.
   - Place CVL - femoral only could be placed.  Aline will be difficult
   given posturing.
   - Antibiotics: meropenem (given PCN allergy) and gent for double
   coverage given strong possibility of pseudomonads, also vanc (no
   history of VRE known).
   - Pressors: try to titrate over to norepinephrine.
   - Consider stress dose steroids if poor response to stim.
   .
   # Nephrolithiasis s/p perc neph tubes.  ALso neurogenic bladder with
   foley.
   - f/u urology recs.
   - change indwelling foley given infection.
   .
   # NSTEMI.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension.  No ischemic ECG
   changes.
   - Continue to trend.
   - Consider ASA if uptrending.
   - No further intervention for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   apical
   area. In the upper abdominal area, bilateral pigtail catheters are
   overlying
   the renal areas indicating bilateral pelvic nephrostomy. These tubes
   were
   present earlier on examination of [**2126-8-1**].

 61F with MS, history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and
   bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension
   following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.
   .
   # Hypotension/septic shock.  Septic shock most likely cause of
   hypotension given previous history of severe infections, intraop
   manipulation, fever, leukocytosis/bandemia.  Suspect UTI leading to
   bacteremic event.  Other infectious possibilities include
   wounds/decubs, pneumonia, GI/C.diff.  Cultures checked but all after
   gent and zosyn.  Other possibilities for hypotension include cardiac
   ischemia/cardiogenic shock (though elevated enzymes more likely demand;
   no ECG changes), bleed, pericardial effusion/tamponade (lower volts on
   ECG, though no reason for effusion/tamponade to be present),
   obstructive/PE (again less likely), adrenal insufficiency (anesthesia
   concern given use of etomidate).  Overwhelmingly seems to be sepsis in
   etiology.
   - f/u bloods and send urines from various sites.
   - f/u urology recs re: any other imaging for abscess etc.
   - C.diff if any diarrhea.
   - Monitor decubs - no active infection evident currently.
   - trend CEs and ECGs.  Check TTE in AM.
   - PM Hct.
   - Add on cortisol and stim in AM.
   - Check cVO2 sat; consider tfusion/inos if low.
   - Trend lactates.
   - Place CVL - femoral only could be placed.  Aline will be difficult
   given posturing.
   - Antibiotics: meropenem (given PCN allergy) and gent for double
   coverage given strong possibility of pseudomonads, also vanc (no
   history of VRE known).
   - Pressors: try to titrate over to norepinephrine.
   - Consider stress dose steroids if poor response to stim.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, anemia, chronic pain, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis can progress to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, or cardiovascular instability.
2. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest septic shock, which can lead to multi-organ failure if not promptly treated.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen if not adequately managed, leading to further complications such as decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain can lead to decreased mobility, increased risk of falls, and impaired quality of life.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity can increase the risk of skin breakdown, pressure ulcers, and infection.
6. Nephrolithiasis: The patient's bilateral nephrolithiasis can lead to further complications such as kidney damage, obstructive nephropathy, or recurrent infections.
7. Neurogenic bladder: The patient's neurogenic bladder can lead to urinary retention, incontinence, or recurrent urinary tract infections.
8. NSTEMI: The patient's NSTEMI can lead to further cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or congestive heart failure.
9. Depression: The patient's depression can worsen if not adequately managed, leading to decreased quality of life, impaired relationships, and increased risk of suicide.
10. Sacral decubitus: The patient's sacral decubitus can lead to skin breakdown, pressure ulcers, and infection if not properly managed.

The patient's treatment plan includes antibiotics, pressors, and stress dose steroids to manage sepsis and septic shock. The patient's nephrostomy tubes will be changed, and the urology team will be consulted for further management of the patient's bilateral nephrolithiasis and neurogenic bladder. The patient's pain and anxiety will be managed with home medications, and wound care consult will be obtained for the sacral decubitus."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   vasculature is not congested. Thin plate atelectasis exists bilaterally
   on the bases,
   however, no evidence of acute infiltrates is present and the pulmonary
   vasculature is not congested. No pneumothorax is identified in the
   apical
   area. In the upper abdominal area, bilateral pigtail catheters are
   overlying
   the renal areas indicating bilateral pelvic nephrostomy. These tubes
   were
   present earlier on examination of [**2126-8-1**].
   IMPRESSION: No evidence of new pneumothorax status post subclavian line

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, and bilateral nephrolithiasis who presented with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. She has a bilateral pelvic nephrostomy tube and a Foley catheter. The patient's condition is complicated by septic shock, likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI), which has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. She also has a history of chronic pain, anemia, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is likely to continue, and there is a risk of developing multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. UTI: The patient's UTI may persist or recur, leading to further complications such as pyelonephritis or sepsis.
3. Nephrolithiasis: The patient's bilateral nephrolithiasis may worsen, leading to further complications such as kidney damage or obstruction.
4. Neurogenic bladder: The patient's neurogenic bladder may lead to further complications such as urinary retention, incontinence, or kidney damage.
5. Decubitus ulcers: The patient's decubitus ulcers may worsen, leading to further complications such as infection, sepsis, or organ failure.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's risk of developing pneumonia is increased due to her immobility and chronic respiratory disease.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may lead to further cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac failure.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to further complications such as fatigue, weakness, or organ failure.
9. Depression: The patient's depression may worsen, leading to further complications such as suicidal ideation, decreased motivation, or decreased adherence to treatment.

Plan:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for septic shock and UTI.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely for signs of sepsis or organ dysfunction.
3. Consider further imaging studies to evaluate the patient's nephrolithiasis and neurogenic bladder.
4. Manage the patient's decubitus ulcers with regular turning, pressure relief, and wound care.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider further respiratory therapy as needed.
6. Consider further cardiovascular evaluation and management to address the patient's tachycardia and hypertension.
7. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider further evaluation and treatment as needed.
8. Consider further depression evaluation and management to address the patient's depression."

   Contrast in the stomach. Hyperdense round-oval foci to the right of mid
   line
   likely from prior contrast in bowel (Can't be certain as there is no
   scout-
   pre contrast image) . A follow-up radiograph may be helpful.
   ECHO [**2127-1-15**]:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CXR AP [**2127-1-15**]:
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is interval development
   of mild
   pulmonary edema, but no abnormal consolidations have been demonstrated.
   Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present, better appreciated
   on the
   current study. The left nephrostomy tube is noted.

   61F with MS, history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and
   bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension
   following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.
   # Hypotension/septic shock.  Septic shock most likely cause of
   hypotension given previous history of severe infections, intraop
   manipulation, fever, leukocytosis/bandemia.  Suspect UTI leading to
   bacteremic event. High suspicion these GNRs are psuedomonas. Still on
   pressors but making good urine and mentating appropriately.
   - Continue: meropenem (given PCN allergy) and gent for double coverage
   given strong possibility of pseudomonas, also vanc (no history of VRE
   known) for h/o MRSA.
   - f/u bloods and send urines from various sites.
   - f/u urology recs re: any other imaging for abscess etc.
   - Check C.diff
   - Monitor decubs - no active infection evident currently.
   - PM Hct to r/o bleed
   - Trend lactates, CEs
   - Pressors: now on norepinephrine
   - consider PICC when afebrile
   - Add on am [**Last Name (un) **], if low, would [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   # Leaking from G tube: Per surgery, may be because bumper was not flush
   to skin. They advanced this and follow up G-tube study was
   nondiagnostic. No significant amount of contrast seen to be leaking
   around G-tube on my read.
   - F/u KUB final report.
   - f/u surgery recs, appreciate their input
   - Continue tube feeds
   LEUKOCYTOSIS: Secondary to urosepsis.
   - f/u cultures
   - F/u stool for cdiff
   ELEVATED INR: Unclear etiology. Consider DIC. DIC labs normal, except
   D-dimer elevated. Platelets stable.
   - Monitor INR and platelets
   # Nephrolithiasis s/p perc neph tubes.  ALso neurogenic bladder with
   foley.
   - f/u urology recs.
   - change indwelling foley given infection.
   # NSTEMI.  Likely demand in setting of hypotension.  No ischemic ECG
   changes. Troponin peaked at 0.53. Now trending down. No wall motion
   abnormalities on echo.
   - No further intervention for now, start low dose statin
   - start aspirin after acute illness
   # MS.  Painful UEs and now bedbound
   - IV pain meds for now given poor GI absorption
   - when taking POs, continue home pain, anxiety regimen.
   # Sacral decubs.
   - wound care consult.
   # Depression - home meds. Feels depressed, pt has flat affect, pt
   having difficulty coping with being debilitated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who was admitted to the ICU after a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. She developed hypotension and septic shock, and was found to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) and sepsis without organ dysfunction. She was started on meropenem and gentamicin for double coverage, and vancomycin for MRSA prophylaxis. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and she is receiving treatment for her UTI, sepsis, and other complications.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for developing sepsis due to her UTI and sepsis without organ dysfunction.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis without organ dysfunction may progress to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, or cardiac arrest.
3. Myocardial infarction: The patient's elevated troponin levels and ECG changes suggest a possible myocardial infarction, which may require further intervention.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to her ongoing bleeding and hemodynamic instability.
5. Chronic pain: The patient's painful UEs and bedbound status may lead to chronic pain and depression.
6. Sacral decubitus: The patient's bedbound status may lead to sacral decubitus, which may require wound care consult.
7. Depression: The patient's depression and flat affect may worsen due to her ongoing illness and debilitation.
8. Infection: The patient's UTI and sepsis may lead to other infections, such as pneumonia or wound infections.
9. Bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding and hemodynamic instability may lead to further bleeding complications.
10. Kidney stones: The patient's bilateral nephrolithiasis may lead to further kidney stone complications, such as recurrent UTIs or kidney damage."

   Contrast in the stomach. Hyperdense round-oval foci to the right of mid
   line
   likely from prior contrast in bowel (Can't be certain as there is no
   scout-
   pre contrast image) . A follow-up radiograph may be helpful.
   ECHO [**2127-1-15**]:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CXR AP [**2127-1-15**]:
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is interval development
   of mild
   pulmonary edema, but no abnormal consolidations have been demonstrated.
   Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present, better appreciated
   on the
   current study. The left nephrostomy tube is noted.

   given no GPs will dc Vanco.  Check gent level. Her bandemia has
   resolved but she continues to have a profound leukocytosis. She is
   clinically improving
We will check stool for c diff, decubiti do not
   appear infected. Consider CT. Will wean off levophed --pt with low
   baseline BP so will tolerate MAPS of 60 following mentation
   and UOP which has remained adequate. Suspect she may have autonomic
   dysregulation from MS and will consider adding midodrine.  In terms
   of recent demand ischemia, her TTE was unremarkable and we
   continue statin.  Hct now stable, no evidence of active bleeding.
   INR and Ptt mildly elevated, ? sepsis related, or nutritional, does not
   appear in DIC and plts remain stable. For MS we continue home meds,
   bowel reg, wound care c/s for decubiti.  In terms of g-tube, surgical
   consult appreciated, No further leakage noted and now tolerated

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   likely from prior contrast in bowel (Can't be certain as there is no
   scout-
   pre contrast image) . A follow-up radiograph may be helpful.
   ECHO [**2127-1-15**]:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CXR AP [**2127-1-15**]:
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is interval development
   of mild
   pulmonary edema, but no abnormal consolidations have been demonstrated.
   Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present, better appreciated
   on the
   current study. The left nephrostomy tube is noted.

We will check stool for c diff, decubiti do not
   appear infected. Consider CT. Will wean off levophed --pt with low
   baseline BP so will tolerate MAPS of 60 following mentation
   and UOP which has remained adequate. Suspect she may have autonomic
   dysregulation from MS and will consider adding midodrine.  In terms
   of recent demand ischemia, her TTE was unremarkable and we
   continue statin.  Hct now stable, no evidence of active bleeding.
   INR and Ptt mildly elevated, ? sepsis related, or nutritional, does not
   appear in DIC and plts remain stable. For MS we continue home meds,
   bowel reg, wound care c/s for decubiti.  In terms of g-tube, surgical

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS), bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. She was admitted to the MICU for post-op hypotension and concern for septic shock. The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and sepsis without organ dysfunction. She also has nephrolithiasis, acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), impaired skin integrity, anxiety, and chronic pain.

Current Condition:

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, with a blood pressure of 104/60 mmHg, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She has a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F) and is alert and comfortable. Her physical examination reveals diminished bilateral breath sounds, pedal edema, and multiple decubiti over the spine and sacrum.

Laboratory Results:

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 28,000/μL, hemoglobin of 11.0 g/dL, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, lactate of 1.8 mmol/L, and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. Her blood cultures are pending, and her urine cultures show growth of Gram-negative rods (GNRs), which are pending identification.

Medical Complications:

The patient is at risk for several medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a UTI and sepsis without organ dysfunction, which may lead to septic shock.
2. Nephrolithiasis: The patient has a history of bilateral nephrolithiasis, which may lead to recurrent kidney stones.
3. Acute myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient has a history of NSTEMI, which may lead to recurrent cardiac events.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has multiple decubiti over the spine and sacrum, which may lead to skin breakdown and infection.
5. Anxiety: The patient has a history of anxiety, which may lead to increased stress and anxiety.
6. Chronic pain: The patient has chronic pain, which may lead to increased pain and discomfort.

Potential Medical Complications:

The patient is also at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of NSTEMI, which may lead to cardiac arrest.
3. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, which may lead to sepsis-induced organ dysfunction.
4. Kidney injury: The patient has a history of bilateral nephrolithiasis, which may lead to kidney injury.
5. Skin infection: The patient has multiple decubiti over the spine and sacrum, which may lead to skin infection.
6. Autonomic dysregulation: The patient has a history of MS, which may lead to autonomic dysregulation.

Plan:

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continue broad empiric antibiotic therapy (gentamicin and meropenem) for UTI and sepsis.
2. Check urine cultures and blood cultures for identification of GNRs.
3. Continue tube feeds and PO.
4. Wean off levophed and monitor hemodynamics.
5. Place PICC line once off pressors.
6. Monitor for signs of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction.
7. Monitor for signs of kidney injury.
8. Monitor for signs of skin infection.
9. Monitor for signs of autonomic dysregulation.
10. Continue home medications for MS and depression.
11. Consult with wound care team for decubiti.
12. Consult with urology team for further management of UTI and sepsis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a post-operative urologic procedure patient who was admitted to the MICU due to post-op hypotension and concern for septic shock. The patient has a history of allergies, including erythromycin, penicillins, latex, and ciprofloxacin. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, and has had several lab tests and imaging studies performed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, and blood pressure of 104/60 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and troponin-T levels. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and the urine culture shows a gram-negative rod (GNR) infection.

The patient's imaging studies show hyperdense round-oval foci in the stomach, which may be related to prior contrast in the bowel. A follow-up radiograph may be helpful.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and LDH levels, as well as the presence of a GNR infection, suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels and abnormal cardiac enzymes suggest the possibility of myocardial infarction.
3. Kidney stones: The patient's imaging studies show nephrolithiasis (kidney stones).
4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level suggests the possibility of anemia, which may be secondary to blood loss or hemorrhage.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin examination is not assessed, but the patient's history of surgical procedures and potential sepsis may increase the risk of impaired skin integrity.
6. Anxiety: The patient's history of chronic pain and potential sepsis may increase the risk of anxiety.
7. Myocardial infarction: The patient's elevated troponin-T levels and abnormal cardiac enzymes suggest the possibility of myocardial infarction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy and monitor for signs of sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin-T levels to assess for signs of myocardial infarction.
3. Consider further imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to assess for signs of kidney stones or other potential complications.
4. Monitor the patient's skin integrity and provide supportive care as needed.
5. Consider anxiolytic therapy to manage the patient's anxiety.
6. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin level and consider transfusion if necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to assess for signs of organ dysfunction or other potential complications."

   Contrast in the stomach. Hyperdense round-oval foci to the right of mid
   line
   likely from prior contrast in bowel (Can't be certain as there is no
   scout-
   pre contrast image) . A follow-up radiograph may be helpful.
   ECHO [**2127-1-15**]:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CXR AP [**2127-1-15**]:
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is interval development
   of mild
   pulmonary edema, but no abnormal consolidations have been demonstrated.
   Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present, better appreciated
   on the
   current study. The left nephrostomy tube is noted.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who was admitted to the ICU due to post-operative hypotension and concern for septic shock following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. She has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and sepsis without organ dysfunction. Her blood cultures remain pending, but urine cultures grew Gram-negative rods (GNR), suspecting pseudomonas.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 91 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 104/60 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes oxygen therapy via nasal cannula, with an SpO2 of 99%. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, anemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a UTI and sepsis without organ dysfunction, which may lead to organ dysfunction or failure if not properly managed.
2. Nephrolithiasis: The patient has a history of bilateral nephrolithiasis, which may increase the risk of kidney damage or failure.
3. Myocardial infarction: The patient's troponin level is elevated, and she has a history of urosepsis, which may increase the risk of myocardial infarction.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a history of urosepsis and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes, which may increase the risk of skin breakdown or infection.
5. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety, which may worsen her overall condition.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process.
7. Elevated INR: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated, which may indicate a bleeding disorder or liver dysfunction.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue antibiotics for UTI and sepsis.
2. Monitor blood cultures and urine cultures.
3. Wean pressors and monitor hemodynamics.
4. Place a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) once off pressors.
5. Continue tube feeds and advance diet as tolerated.
6. Monitor for signs of sepsis and organ dysfunction.
7. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and prophylactic anticoagulation therapy.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications and ensure optimal care."

   Contrast in the stomach. Hyperdense round-oval foci to the right of mid
   line
   likely from prior contrast in bowel (Can't be certain as there is no
   scout-
   pre contrast image) . A follow-up radiograph may be helpful.
   ECHO [**2127-1-15**]:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CXR AP [**2127-1-15**]:
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is interval development
   of mild
   pulmonary edema, but no abnormal consolidations have been demonstrated.
   Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present, better appreciated
   on the
   current study. The left nephrostomy tube is noted.

   - Monitor decubs - no active infection evident currently.
   - Wean pressors today and monitor hemodynamics
   - Place PICC once off pressors
   - Can add midodrine or given fluids if becomes hypotensive
   # Leaking from G tube: Per surgery, may be because bumper was not flush
   to skin. They advanced this and follow up G-tube study was
   nondiagnostic. No significant amount of contrast seen to be leaking
   around G-tube on my read.
   - F/u KUB and g-tube study final report.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS), urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. She was admitted to the MICU following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy due to post-op hypotension and concern for septic shock.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 13.2-36.5
* Hct: 38.3-32.8
* Plt: 335-244
* Cr: 0.4
* TropT: 0.53
* Glucose: 118-138
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.9/41.5/1.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 607/12/0.38, ALT/AST: 13/35, Alk Phos/T Bili: 71/1.3, Differential-Neuts: 94.9%, Band: 7.0%, Lymph: 3.0%, Mono: 1.8%, Eos: 0.1%, D-dimer: 11032 ng/mL, Lactic Acid: 1.4 mmol/L, LDH: 280 IU/L, Ca++: 7.6 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's imaging results show:

* ECHO: Normal left atrium, normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic function (LVEF 60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP < 12 mmHg).
* CXR AP: Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, with interval development of mild pulmonary edema, but no abnormal consolidations have been demonstrated. Small bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present.

The patient's microbiology results show:

* Blood culture: Pending
* Urine culture: Preliminary L nephrostomy tube, Gram negative rod(s)
* Final urine culture: L nephrostomy tube, Gram negative rod(s)

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Urinary tract infection (UTI)
* Sepsis without organ dysfunction
* Nephrolithiasis (kidney stones)
* Myocardial infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
* Impaired skin integrity
* Anxiety
* Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding)
* Chronic pain
* Sepsis without organ dysfunction

The patient's medical complications include:

* Leaking from G tube: May be due to the bumper not being flush to the skin. The patient's urology team will be consulted for further evaluation and management.
* Nephrolithiasis s/p perc neph tubes: The patient has bilateral nephrostomy tubes and a history of urosepsis.
* NSTEMI: The patient's troponin peaked at 0.53 and is now trending down. No wall motion abnormalities were seen on echo.
* MS: The patient has a history of MS and is experiencing painful UEs and is now bedbound.
* Sacral decubs: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer and will require wound care consult.
* Depression: The patient is experiencing depression and will require a social worker consult.

The patient's medications include:

* Meropenem (given PCN allergy)
* Gentamicin (for double coverage given strong possibility of pseudomonas)
* Vancomycin (discontinued due to growing GNR)
* Midodrine (to be added if the patient becomes hypotensive)
* Aspirin (to be started after acute illness)
* Statin (to be started)
* PPI (for stress ulcer prophylaxis)
* Subcutaneous heparin (for DVT prophylaxis)

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: tube feeds and PO
* Glycemic control: blood glucose monitoring and insulin therapy as needed
* Lines: arterial line, multi-lumen line
* Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP
* Wound care: sacral decubitus ulcer
* Pain management: PO and IV analgesics
* Anxiety management: PO and IV anxiolytics
* Depression management: social worker consult and home meds."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   likely from prior contrast in bowel (Can't be certain as there is no
   scout-
   pre contrast image) . A follow-up radiograph may be helpful.
   ECHO [**2127-1-15**]:
   The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   60%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling
   pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are
   focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+)
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CXR AP [**2127-1-15**]:
   Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. There is interval development
   of mild
   pulmonary edema, but no abnormal consolidations have been demonstrated.
   Small
   bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present, better appreciated
   on the
   current study. The left nephrostomy tube is noted.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes. She was admitted to the ICU after a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy, presenting with hypotension and concern for septic shock. The patient has been diagnosed with urinary tract infection (UTI), sepsis without organ dysfunction, nephrolithiasis, and myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient has been treated with meropenem and gentamicin for double coverage, and the blood cultures remain pending. The urine cultures have grown GNR, and speciation is pending, with a suspicion of pseudomonas.

The patient's current condition is:

* Vital signs: T 36.0°C, HR 91 bpm, BP 104/60 mmHg, RR 9 breaths/min, SpO2 99%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Norepinephrine infusion at 0.13 mcg/kg/min
* Fluid balance: Total in 3,446 mL, total out 2,227 mL
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen, ABG: pH 7.22, PCO2 22 mmHg, PO2 101 mmHg
* Laboratory results: WBC 13.2 K/μL, Hct 38.3%, Plt 335 K/μL, Cr 0.4 mg/dL, TropT 0.53 ng/mL, Glucose 118 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's blood cultures remain pending, and the urine cultures have grown GNR, which may indicate a more severe infection.
2. Nephrolithiasis: The patient has a history of bilateral nephrolithiasis and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes, which may lead to further complications.
3. Myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient has been diagnosed with NSTEMI, which may require further intervention.
4. Leaking from G-tube: The patient's G-tube is leaking, which may lead to further complications.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be secondary to urosepsis.
6. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated, which may indicate DIC or another underlying condition.
7. Nephrolithiasis s/p perc neph tubes: The patient has a history of nephrolithiasis and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes, which may lead to further complications.
8. Neurogenic bladder: The patient has a neurogenic bladder, which may lead to further complications.
9. Sacral decubitus: The patient has sacral decubitus, which may lead to further complications.
10. Depression: The patient is experiencing depression, which may require further intervention.

Assessment and plan:

1. Continue meropenem and gentamicin for double coverage.
2. Monitor blood cultures and urine cultures.
3. F/u urology recs.
4. Wean pressors today and monitor hemodynamics.
5. Place PICC once off pressors.
6. Continue tube feeds and PO.
7. Start low-dose statin.
8. Start aspirin after acute illness.
9. IV pain meds for now given poor GI absorption.
10. Wound care consult.
11. SW consult.
12. Continue monitoring patient's condition and adjust plan as needed."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  61F MS, neurogenic bladder with indwelling
   foley, prior episodes of urosepsis, bl nephrolithiasis w/ bl perc
   nephrostomy tubes p/w hypotension / septic shock after planned R
   ureteroscopy and lithotripsy, now with PSA in urine. Bolused 1.5L,
   Midodrine started. Levophed restarted overnight for hypot and low UOP,
   now off. CT torso without evidence of abscess, b/l effusions.
   AF  TM 100/60  90  10  94% 1L
   Alert and comfortable, severe contractures of UEs, edematous
   Diminshed BS, bb rales
   RR, no M

   2+ pedal edema
   multiple decubiti over spine/sacrum
   Labs: WBC 20, HCT 34, K+ 3.8, Cr 0.3, INR 1.2, esr 53
   IMP: Septic shock post GU manipulation, now with PSA in urine.
   Clinically improving.
   Will continue [**Last Name (un) **] for PSA UTI.  Her leukocytosis is trending down, but
   remains quite elevated.  There was no abscess on CT and this is all
   most likely from her urinary infection. We await  BM for stool c diff.
   She is now off levophed.  Her a-line is very positional, likely
   contributing to intermittent hypot as well as probable autonomic
   dysregulation from MS.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] con't midodrine, following UOP
   and mentation as parameters as her BP/MAPS run low.  In terms of recent
   demand ischemia, her TTE was unremarkable and we continue statin. Her
   hct remains stable, w/o evidence of active bleeding. INR and Ptt  have
   normalized--? sepsis related or nutritional. For MS we continue home
   meds, bowel reg, wound care c/s for decubiti.   We continue paxil for
   depression.   TFs and asp diet. In terms of access, will request Picc
   and then d/c fem line.  I am concerned that her RUE appears swollen .
   L, will obtain doppler. D/c aline if remains off pressors, sq hep, full
   code.
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.
   Will continue in ICU for now, Critically ill. Total time: 60 min

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - In the AM: Pressors were weaned off in the AM.  Patients BP/MAP
   dropped.  She received 1.5L of NS with some response.  However, she was
   restarted on levo as she was anasarcic and sats dropped from 98% to 91%
   w/ fluids.  She was started on midodrine 5mg tid, to be uptitrated as
   tolerated.
   - KUB final read: no contrast material within the stomach identified.
   - [**Doctor First Name 3**] does not think there is a leak, are monitoring overnight
   - Wound consult left recs
   - Urine cx grew: PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA I-cefepime/ceftaz/gent; R
   cipro/zosyn; and S to meropenem/tobramycin
   - Discontinued gent given sensitivities above; continued meropenem
   - As patient continued to require pressors, got a CT abdomen/pelvis to
   r/o abcess/infxn (which was a somewhat limited study as iv contrast
   given through central line):
   1. Definite intra-abdominal fluid collection; small amount of ascites.
   2. Bl pleural effus with lung collapse and pneumonia bl
   3. Multiple renal & ureteral stones
   4. Anasarca
   5. Subcutaneous gas R forearm ? [**12-31**] IV placement vs infx
   6. Hypodense liver lesions
   7. Skin erosion at sacrum w/ exposure of sacrum & coccyx concerning for
   severe decubitus ulcer and underlying osteomyelitis
   - Couldn't place peripheral ivs, nurse tried and iv nurse tried, kept
   the femoral central line
   - In the AM: discontinued vanc; But restarted Vanc after CT results due
   to concern for HAP and/or osteo. Checked ESR and CRP w/ AM labs.

   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the

   add the following points:  61F MS, neurogenic bladder with indwelling
   foley, prior episodes of urosepsis, bl nephrolithiasis w/ bl perc
   nephrostomy tubes p/w hypotension / septic shock after planned R
   ureteroscopy and lithotripsy, now with PSA in urine. Bolused 1.5L,
   Midodrine started. Levophed restarted overnight for hypot and low UOP,
   now off. CT torso without evidence of abscess, b/l effusions.

   Clinically improving.
   Will continue [**Last Name (un) **] for PSA UTI.  Her leukocytosis is trending down, but
   remains quite elevated.  There was no abscess on CT and this is all
   most likely from her urinary infection. We await  BM for stool c diff.
   She is now off levophed.  Her a-line is very positional, likely
   contributing to intermittent hypot as well as probable autonomic
   dysregulation from MS.  [**Name13 (STitle) **] con't midodrine, following UOP
   and mentation as parameters as her BP/MAPS run low.  In terms of recent

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. She has been diagnosed with septic shock secondary to urosepsis, with urine cultures growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She has also been diagnosed with nephrolithiasis, acute myocardial infarction, and impaired skin integrity.

Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and low urine output are likely due to septic shock secondary to urosepsis.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which may be contributing to her septic shock.
3. Nephrolithiasis: The patient has bilateral nephrolithiasis, which may be causing her UTI and septic shock.
4. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI): The patient has been diagnosed with AMI, which may be contributing to her hypotension and low urine output.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be contributing to her septic shock and UTI.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a skin erosion at the sacral region, which may be a sign of osteomyelitis.
2. Decubitus ulcers: The patient has multiple decubiti over her spine and sacrum, which may be contributing to her septic shock and UTI.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions and lung collapse, which may be contributing to her respiratory failure.
4. Renal failure: The patient has nephrolithiasis and may be at risk for renal failure.
5. Sepsis: The patient has septic shock and may be at risk for further sepsis.

Plan:

1. Continue meropenem for at least 2 weeks to treat the UTI.
2. Restart vancomycin, but may be discontinued if urine cultures are negative.
3. Continue midodrine to support blood pressure.
4. Monitor urine output and mentation for signs of end-organ perfusion.
5. Check blood cultures to rule out secondary bacteremia.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's skin integrity and wound care.
7. Consider placing a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) to improve access.
8. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider incentive spirometry.
9. Consider holding lasix due to the patient's hypotension.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolytes and renal function.

This patient requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment to manage her septic shock, UTI, and other medical complications."

   3. Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent lung collapse and
   pneumonia bilaterally.
   4. Multiple renal and ureteral stones which appears more fragmented
   than prior study. Status post nephrostomy tube placement. Multiple
   hyperdense
   material in the urinary bladder, likely stones, decreased since prior
   exam.
   Trace pericardial effusion, extensive subcutaneous edema and small
   amount of intra-abdominal ascites most compatible with anasarca.
   5. Subcutaneous gas in the right forearm subcutaneous tissues may be
   secondary to IV line placement. Clinical correlation for infectious
   etiology is recommended.
   6. Two hypodense liver lesions, stable since [**2126-1-27**]. As recommended
   previously an MRI may be helpful in further evaluation of the
   heterogeneous lesion in the right lobe. Multiple other liver lesions
   seen on [**2-8**] study are not well appreciated on the current study,
   likely due to timing of contrast.
   7. Skin erosion at the sacral region and apparent exposure of sacrum
   and
   coccyx to open air is concerning for severe decubitus ulcer and
   underlying
   osteomyelitis. Clinical correlation is recommended.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Trace pericardial effusion, extensive subcutaneous edema and small
   amount of intra-abdominal ascites most compatible with anasarca.
   5. Subcutaneous gas in the right forearm subcutaneous tissues may be
   secondary to IV line placement. Clinical correlation for infectious
   etiology is recommended.
   6. Two hypodense liver lesions, stable since [**2126-1-27**]. As recommended
   previously an MRI may be helpful in further evaluation of the
   heterogeneous lesion in the right lobe. Multiple other liver lesions
   seen on [**2-8**] study are not well appreciated on the current study,
   likely due to timing of contrast.
   7. Skin erosion at the sacral region and apparent exposure of sacrum
   and
   coccyx to open air is concerning for severe decubitus ulcer and
   underlying
   osteomyelitis. Clinical correlation is recommended.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes who presents with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy. She has developed septic shock secondary to urosepsis after operative manipulation, with urine cultures growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. She has also developed bilateral pleural effusions, anasarca, and skin erosion at the sacral region, which is concerning for severe decubitus ulcer and underlying osteomyelitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient is at risk of developing further complications due to septic shock, including organ dysfunction, multi-organ failure, and death.
2. Urosepsis: The patient's urine cultures growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa may indicate a persistent infection, which can lead to further complications such as kidney damage, sepsis, and death.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions: The patient's bilateral pleural effusions may lead to respiratory compromise, which can exacerbate her hypoxia and further compromise her respiratory function.
4. Anasarca: The patient's anasarca may lead to further complications such as respiratory distress, hypoxia, and cardiac failure.
5. Skin erosion at the sacral region: The patient's skin erosion at the sacral region may lead to further complications such as decubitus ulcer, osteomyelitis, and sepsis.
6. Nephrolithiasis: The patient's nephrolithiasis may lead to further complications such as kidney damage, sepsis, and death.
7. Myocardial infarction: The patient's elevated troponin levels and ST segment changes on ECG may indicate a myocardial infarction, which can lead to further complications such as cardiac failure, arrhythmias, and death.
8. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to further complications such as decubitus ulcer, osteomyelitis, and sepsis.
9. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety may exacerbate her hypoxia and further compromise her respiratory function.
10. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain may lead to further complications such as depression, anxiety, and decreased mobility.

Recommendations:

1. Continue meropenem for at least 2 weeks to treat the patient's urosepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's urine output and mentation for signs of end-organ perfusion.
3. Check the patient's blood cultures to determine the presence of bacteremia.
4. Place a PICC line to ensure adequate access for medications and fluids.
5. Continue midodrine 5mg tid to treat the patient's hypotension.
6. Monitor the patient's INR and platelets to ensure they are within normal limits.
7. Consider enemas to treat the patient's constipation.
8. Monitor the patient's wound care to prevent further complications such as decubitus ulcer and osteomyelitis.
9. Consider an MRI to further evaluate the patient's liver lesions.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory function and provide supportive care as needed."

   Trace pericardial effusion, extensive subcutaneous edema and small

   seen on [**2-8**] study are not well appreciated on the current study,
   likely due to timing of contrast.
   7. Skin erosion at the sacral region and apparent exposure of sacrum
   and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities and complications. Here is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is resistant to multiple antibiotics.
* The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, which requires close monitoring and management.
* The patient has nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), which may require further evaluation and treatment.
* The patient has a history of myocardial infarction (heart attack) and is at risk for further cardiac complications.
* The patient has impaired skin integrity, including a severe decubitus ulcer and underlying osteomyelitis, which requires aggressive wound care and infection control measures.
* The patient has anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding), which may require transfusion support.
* The patient has chronic pain, which may require further evaluation and management.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Further cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
* Worsening of sepsis, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
* Development of respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
* Development of renal failure, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
* Development of gastrointestinal complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, ileus, and perforation.
* Development of neurological complications, including seizures, stroke, and encephalopathy.
* Development of skin and soft tissue infections, including cellulitis, abscesses, and necrotizing fasciitis.
* Development of osteomyelitis, which can lead to further bone and joint complications.

**Management Plan:**

* Continue antibiotics for UTI and sepsis, with close monitoring of cultures and sensitivities.
* Manage pain and anxiety with medications and non-pharmacological interventions.
* Monitor and manage cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and heart failure.
* Monitor and manage respiratory complications, including ARDS.
* Monitor and manage gastrointestinal complications, including bleeding, ileus, and perforation.
* Monitor and manage neurological complications, including seizures, stroke, and encephalopathy.
* Monitor and manage skin and soft tissue infections, including cellulitis, abscesses, and necrotizing fasciitis.
* Monitor and manage osteomyelitis, with consideration of surgical intervention.
* Consider further evaluation and treatment for nephrolithiasis, including lithotripsy or nephrostomy tube placement.
* Consider further evaluation and treatment for chronic pain, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and pain management medications."

   Imaging: 1. Limited study as delayed images were not obtained and also

   2. Definite intra-abdominal fluid collection. There is a small amount
   of
   intra-abdominal ascites.
   3. Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent lung collapse and
   pneumonia bilaterally.
   4. Multiple renal and ureteral stones which appears more fragmented
   than prior study. Status post nephrostomy tube placement. Multiple
   hyperdense
   material in the urinary bladder, likely stones, decreased since prior
   exam.
   Trace pericardial effusion, extensive subcutaneous edema and small
   amount of intra-abdominal ascites most compatible with anasarca.
   5. Subcutaneous gas in the right forearm subcutaneous tissues may be
   secondary to IV line placement. Clinical correlation for infectious
   etiology is recommended.
   6. Two hypodense liver lesions, stable since [**2126-1-27**]. As recommended
   previously an MRI may be helpful in further evaluation of the
   heterogeneous lesion in the right lobe. Multiple other liver lesions
   seen on [**2-8**] study are not well appreciated on the current study,
   likely due to timing of contrast.
   7. Skin erosion at the sacral region and apparent exposure of sacrum
   and
   coccyx to open air is concerning for severe decubitus ulcer and
   underlying
   osteomyelitis. Clinical correlation is recommended.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - In the AM: Pressors were weaned off in the AM.  Patients BP/MAP
   dropped.  She received 1.5L of NS with some response.  However, she was
   restarted on levo as she was anasarcic and sats dropped from 98% to 91%
   w/ fluids.  She was started on midodrine 5mg tid, to be uptitrated as
   tolerated.
   - KUB final read: no contrast material within the stomach identified.
   - [**Doctor First Name 3**] does not think there is a leak, are monitoring overnight
   - Wound consult left recs
   - Urine cx grew: PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA I-cefepime/ceftaz/gent; R
   cipro/zosyn; and S to meropenem/tobramycin
   - Discontinued gent given sensitivities above; continued meropenem
   - As patient continued to require pressors, got a CT abdomen/pelvis to
   r/o abcess/infxn (which was a somewhat limited study as iv contrast
   given through central line):
   1. Definite intra-abdominal fluid collection; small amount of ascites.
   2. Bl pleural effus with lung collapse and pneumonia bl
   3. Multiple renal & ureteral stones
   4. Anasarca
   5. Subcutaneous gas R forearm ? [**12-31**] IV placement vs infx
   6. Hypodense liver lesions
   7. Skin erosion at sacrum w/ exposure of sacrum & coccyx concerning for
   severe decubitus ulcer and underlying osteomyelitis
   - Couldn't place peripheral ivs, nurse tried and iv nurse tried, kept
   the femoral central line
   - In the AM: discontinued vanc; But restarted Vanc after CT results due
   to concern for HAP and/or osteo. Checked ESR and CRP w/ AM labs.

   material in the urinary bladder, likely stones, decreased since prior
   exam.
   Trace pericardial effusion, extensive subcutaneous edema and small
   amount of intra-abdominal ascites most compatible with anasarca.
   5. Subcutaneous gas in the right forearm subcutaneous tissues may be
   secondary to IV line placement. Clinical correlation for infectious
   etiology is recommended.
   6. Two hypodense liver lesions, stable since [**2126-1-27**]. As recommended
   previously an MRI may be helpful in further evaluation of the
   heterogeneous lesion in the right lobe. Multiple other liver lesions
   seen on [**2-8**] study are not well appreciated on the current study,
   likely due to timing of contrast.
   7. Skin erosion at the sacral region and apparent exposure of sacrum
   and
   coccyx to open air is concerning for severe decubitus ulcer and
   underlying
   osteomyelitis. Clinical correlation is recommended.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's urine culture grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a gram-negative rod, and the patient is receiving meropenem and gentamicin for double coverage. This increases the risk of sepsis, particularly in a patient with a history of urosepsis and bilateral nephrolithiasis.
2. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a skin erosion at the sacral region, which is concerning for severe decubitus ulcer and underlying osteomyelitis. The patient's ESR and CRP are elevated, which suggests an inflammatory response.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 11.3 g/dL, which is below the normal range. This may be secondary to blood loss, bleeding, or other underlying conditions.
4. Nephrolithiasis: The patient has bilateral nephrolithiasis, which increases the risk of recurrent kidney stones and potentially acute kidney injury.
5. Myocardial Infarction: The patient has a history of urosepsis, which may have triggered a myocardial infarction. The patient's troponin level is elevated, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) shows no ischemic changes.
6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a skin erosion at the sacral region, which is concerning for severe decubitus ulcer and underlying osteomyelitis. The patient's skin integrity is also compromised due to the presence of subcutaneous gas in the right forearm subcutaneous tissues.
7. Anxiety: The patient is experiencing anxiety, which may be related to their underlying medical conditions, pain, or other factors.
8. Chronic Pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain, which may be exacerbated by their current medical conditions.
9. Depression: The patient is experiencing depression, which may be related to their underlying medical conditions, pain, or other factors.

In terms of the patient's current condition, the following findings are notable:

* The patient's blood pressure is 105/61 mmHg, which is below the normal range.
* The patient's heart rate is 111 bpm, which is elevated.
* The patient's respiratory rate is 16 inspirations per minute, which is within the normal range.
* The patient's oxygen saturation is 94%, which is within the normal range.
* The patient's temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), which is within the normal range.
* The patient's white blood cell count is 13.2 x 10^9/L, which is elevated.
* The patient's hemoglobin level is 11.3 g/dL, which is below the normal range.
* The patient's platelet count is 335 x 10^9/L, which is within the normal range.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a septic individual with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and a history of kidney stones. They have been treated with antibiotics, including gentamicin, vancomycin, and meropenem, and have undergone an ultrasound to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 92 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 137/79 mmHg. They are receiving fluids and vasopressors to support their blood pressure. The patient's laboratory results show evidence of sepsis, with elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. They also have evidence of acute kidney injury, anemia, and elevated troponin levels, suggesting possible myocardial infarction.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate dehydrogenase and troponin levels suggest possible sepsis-related organ dysfunction, which could lead to acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, or cardiovascular collapse.
2. Deep vein thrombosis: Although the ultrasound ruled out DVT, the patient's history of kidney stones and sepsis increase their risk of developing DVT.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels suggest possible acute kidney injury, which could worsen their sepsis and increase their risk of mortality.
4. Myocardial infarction: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest possible myocardial infarction, which could worsen their sepsis and increase their risk of mortality.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen their sepsis and increase their risk of mortality.
6. Chronic pain: The patient's chronic pain could worsen their sepsis and increase their risk of mortality.
7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity could worsen their sepsis and increase their risk of mortality.
8. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety could worsen their sepsis and increase their risk of mortality.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of their sepsis, including aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support, and antibiotic therapy. They also require close monitoring of their vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to detect any signs of organ dysfunction or complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes, who presents with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotrispsy.

The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock secondary to urosepsis after operative manipulation, and is being treated with meropenem and midodrine. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, but still shows a left shift, indicating ongoing inflammation.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Continued septic shock: The patient's blood cultures remain pending, and there is a risk of continued septic shock if the infection is not properly treated.
2. Osteomyelitis: Although the patient's WBC count is trending down, there is still a risk of osteomyelitis, particularly given the patient's history of urosepsis and bilateral nephrostomy tubes.
3. DVT: The patient has RUE edema, which may increase the risk of DVT. The ultrasound was negative for DVT, but it is still a potential complication.
4. Lung collapse: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, which may worsen if the patient's volume overload is not managed.
5. Constipation: The patient has a history of constipation and is at risk of further constipation due to the use of anticholinergics and opioids.
6. Leaking from G tube: The patient has a leaking G tube, which may require further management and possibly surgical intervention.
7. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
8. Nephrolithiasis: The patient has a history of nephrolithiasis, which may worsen if the patient's volume overload is not managed.
9. Neurogenic bladder: The patient has a neurogenic bladder with a Foley catheter, which may require further management and possibly surgical intervention.
10. Myocardial infarction: The patient has a history of myocardial infarction, which may increase the risk of further cardiac complications.

In summary, the patient has several potential medical complications that can arise, including septic shock, osteomyelitis, DVT, lung collapse, constipation, leaking from G tube, elevated INR, nephrolithiasis, neurogenic bladder, and myocardial infarction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of multiple sclerosis, urosepsis, bilateral nephrolithiasis, and bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes, who presented with hypotension following a right-sided ureteroscopy and lithotripsy.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Sepsis with a suspected pseudomonal UTI, which is being treated with meropenem.
2. Septic UTI, with urine cultures growing pseudomonas and blood cultures pending.
3. Blateral pleural effusions, which are secondary to volume overload and lung collapse, and are not suspected to be infected.
4. Questionable osteomyelitis, which is unlikely given the downtrending WBC count.
5. RUE edema, which was previously suspected to be a DVT, but was ruled out by ultrasound.
6. Constipation, which has been resolved.
7. Elevated INR, which is being monitored and is expected to improve with nutrition.
8. Nephrolithiasis, which is being managed with percutaneous nephrostomy tubes.
9. NSTEMI, which is being treated with statins and aspirin.
10. MS, which is causing painful UEs and bedbound status.
11. Sacral decubitus ulcers, which are being managed with wound care.
12. Depression, which is being managed with home antidepressant and anxiety regimen.

The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving the following treatments:

1. Fibersource HN (Full) nutrition at 68 mL/hour.
2. Prophylactic antibiotics for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
3. Midodrine 5mg tid to compensate for hypotension.
4. Meropenem IV Q8H for pseudomonal UTI.
5. Incentive spirometry to manage pleural effusions.
6. Hold on further IVFs due to net fluid loss of 7L.
7. Monitor INR and platelets.
8. Continue statin and aspirin for NSTEMI.
9. Manage MS symptoms with home dilaudid and anxiety regimen.
10. Continue wound care for sacral decubitus ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Worsening of sepsis and septic shock.
2. Development of ARDS due to bilateral pleural effusions.
3. Progression of osteomyelitis if left untreated.
4. DVT or PE if prophylaxis is inadequate.
5. Further complications from MS, such as worsening of UEs or Les.
6. Development of chronic kidney disease due to nephrolithiasis.
7. Increased risk of bleeding due to elevated INR.
8. Worsening of depression and anxiety.
9. Development of pressure ulcers due to prolonged bedbound status.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's conditions closely and adjust treatment plans accordingly to prevent potential complications and improve outcomes."
