   This is a 51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and
   restrictive disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generelly due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved.
   - repeat ABG after trach respositioning, goal PCO2 70s-80s
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra, vanco for now as below
   - Call IP for new custom made trach to avoid future movement of trach.
   # Hypotension: hypotensive on presentation, unclear etiology. Likely
   hypovolemia vs infection.  Known pseudomonas PNA.  Currently
   normotensive, off pressors since [**9-13**] midnight.
   - hold pressors unless MAPs <55.
   - continue fluid boluses prn
   - continue empiric vancomycin dosed by level, tobra dosed by level,
   hold off on colistin.
   - serial HCTs
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx, urine cx
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: The patient recently grew
   resistant pseudomonas on his sputum which persisted on repeat cx [**2178-9-9**]
   sensitive to tobramycin and gent only. Colistin sent to outside lab but
   sensis not available in our system. He is currently on tobramycin day
   [**10-19**]. Was planning on completion of course [**2178-9-18**].
   - check tobra level, received 120mg IV dose in ED
   - not giving colistin now.  If febrile again, c/s ID and discuss adding
   colistin.
   # Elevated INR: INR 7 on admission from 2.7 the day before. Unclear
   etiology of rapid elevation, has been on7.5mg daily dosing which was
   relatively stable dose last several days. [**Month (only) 11**] be elevated if drawn off
   line or with recent abx, nutritional deficiency. HCT and PLT stable
   with no e/o active bleed.  Rechecks of INR consistently high.  Given
   Vit K 2mg NG and INR came down 1 point.
   - Vitamin K 5mg ng this AM
   - repeat INR in PM
   - if remains elevated [**6-13**] with no active bleeding will hold coumadin,
   and give PO vitamin K given has had recent bleed
   - if develops active bleed, IV vitamin K
   -restart coumadin once INR <3.
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - repeat UA and cx
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improved from nadir of 90s. Unclear etiology last
   admission.
   - continue to trend
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - holding coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, continue to monitor
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   -Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
   # Anemia: HCT stable since discharge around new baseline 28. Last
   transfused [**2178-8-31**] for history of GIB, bleeding from trach site, and
   psoas bleed found on CT as well as likely component of AOCD and renal
   insufficiency. Coumadin restarted prior to discharge and heparin d/c'd.
   - continue to trend
   - maintain active type and screen, IV access.
   # H/O DVT: BLE U/S most recently did not show DVT. Restarted warfarin
   [**9-5**].
   - holding coumadin now given supratherapeutic INR, monitor coags

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, VAP, and ARF. He is currently readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.

The patient's respiratory status has improved significantly after repositioning of the tracheostomy tube with bronchoscopy, with ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. The goal is to maintain PCO2 in the 70s-80s range.

The patient's hypotension is likely due to hypovolemia or infection, and he is currently normotensive off pressors. The plan is to continue fluid boluses as needed and monitor serial HCTs.

The patient has resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP, which is being treated with tobramycin, and colistin is being held pending sensitivity results. The plan is to continue tobra and monitor for febrile episodes.

The patient's elevated INR is unclear in etiology, but it has been stabilized with vitamin K. The plan is to repeat INR in the PM and adjust therapy accordingly.

The patient has a history of constipation, and his bowel regimen will be continued. He also has a history of funguria, which was treated with fluconazole, and will need to be rechecked.

The patient's thrombocytopenia has improved from its nadir, and the etiology remains unclear. The plan is to continue to trend.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which was rate-controlled with metoprolol, but is currently being held due to hypotension. The plan is to restart warfarin once the INR is <3.

The patient has chronic renal failure, which is likely due to AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension. The plan is to continue to monitor UOP and BUN/Cr levels.

The patient has anemia, which is being managed with transfusions as needed. The plan is to continue to trend and maintain active type and screen, IV access.

The patient has a history of DVT, which was evaluated with BLE U/S and found to be negative. The plan is to restart warfarin once the INR is <3.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure can lead to further respiratory distress, including respiratory acidosis and hypercapnia.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can lead to further compromise of his cardiac function, including decreased cardiac output and decreased perfusion of vital organs.
3. Infection: The patient's resistant pseudomonas VAP can lead to further sepsis and organ dysfunction.
4. Bleeding: The patient's elevated INR can lead to bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and bleeding from the tracheostomy site.
5. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure can lead to further decline in kidney function, including acute kidney injury and end-stage renal disease.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia can lead to further compromise of his cardiac function, including decreased cardiac output and decreased perfusion of vital organs.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can lead to further bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial bleeding.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, I recommend close monitoring and aggressive management of his respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal function to prevent further decline in his condition."

   This is a 51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and
   restrictive disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generelly due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved.
   - repeat ABG after trach respositioning, goal PCO2 70s-80s
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra, vanco for now as below
   # Hypotension: hypotensive on presentation, unclear etiology. Likely
   hypovolemia vs infection.  Known pseudomonas PNA.  Currently
   normotensive, off pressors since [**9-13**] midnight.
   - hold pressors unless MAPs <55.
   - continue fluid boluses prn
   - continue empiric vancomycin dosed by level, tobra dosed by level,
   hold off on colistin.
   - serial HCTs
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx, urine cx
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: The patient recently grew
   resistant pseudomonas on his sputum which persisted on repeat cx [**2178-9-9**]
   sensitive to tobramycin and gent only. Colistin sent to outside lab but
   sensis not available in our system. He is currently on tobramycin day
   [**10-19**]. Was planning on completion of course [**2178-9-18**].
   - check tobra level, received 120mg IV dose in ED
   - consider add colistin after discussion with renal and ID, hold for
   now.
   # Elevated INR: INR 7 on admission from 2.7 the day before. Unclear
   etiology of rapid elevation, has been on7.5mg daily dosing which was
   relatively stable dose last several days. [**Month (only) 11**] be elevated if drawn off
   line or with recent abx, nutritional deficiency. HCT and PLT stable
   with no e/o active bleed.  Rechecks of INR consistently high.  Given
   Vit K 2mg NG and INR came down 1 point.
   - Vitamin K 5mg ng this AM
   - repeat INR in PM
   - if remains elevated [**6-13**] with no active bleeding will hold coumadin,
   and give PO vitamin K given has had recent bleed
   - if develops active bleed, IV vitamin K
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - repeat UA and cx
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improved from nadir of 90s. Unclear etiology last
   admission.
   - continue to trend
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - holding coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, continue to monitor
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   -Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
   # Anemia: HCT stable since discharge around new baseline 28. Last
   transfused [**2178-8-31**] for history of GIB, bleeding from trach site, and
   psoas bleed found on CT as well as likely component of AOCD and renal
   insufficiency. Coumadin restarted prior to discharge and heparin d/c'd.
   - continue to trend
   - maintain active type and screen, IV access.
   # H/O DVT: BLE U/S most recently did not show DVT. Restarted warfarin
   [**9-5**].
   - holding coumadin now given supratherapeutic INR, monitor coags

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   This is a 51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and
   restrictive disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic
   respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generelly due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved.
   - repeat ABG after trach respositioning, goal PCO2 70s-80s
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra, vanco for now as below
   # Hypotension: hypotensive on presentation, unclear etiology. Likely
   hypovolemia vs infection.  Known pseudomonas PNA.  Currently
   normotensive, off pressors since [**9-13**] midnight.
   - hold pressors unless MAPs <55.
   - continue fluid boluses prn
   - continue empiric vancomycin dosed by level, tobra dosed by level,
   hold off on colistin.
   - serial HCTs
   - f/u blood cx, sputum cx, urine cx
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: The patient recently grew
   resistant pseudomonas on his sputum which persisted on repeat cx [**2178-9-9**]
   sensitive to tobramycin and gent only. Colistin sent to outside lab but
   sensis not available in our system. He is currently on tobramycin day
   [**10-19**]. Was planning on completion of course [**2178-9-18**].
   - check tobra level, received 120mg IV dose in ED
   - consider add colistin after discussion with renal and ID, hold for
   now.
   # Elevated INR: INR 7 on admission from 2.7 the day before. Unclear
   etiology of rapid elevation, has been on7.5mg daily dosing which was
   relatively stable dose last several days. [**Month (only) 11**] be elevated if drawn off
   line or with recent abx, nutritional deficiency. HCT and PLT stable
   with no e/o active bleed.  Rechecks of INR consistently high.  Given
   Vit K 2mg NG and INR came down 1 point.
   - Vitamin K 5mg ng this AM
   - repeat INR in PM
   - if remains elevated [**6-13**] with no active bleeding will hold coumadin,
   and give PO vitamin K given has had recent bleed
   - if develops active bleed, IV vitamin K
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - repeat UA and cx
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improved from nadir of 90s. Unclear etiology last
   admission.
   - continue to trend
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - holding coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, continue to monitor
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   -Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
   # Anemia: HCT stable since discharge around new baseline 28. Last
   transfused [**2178-8-31**] for history of GIB, bleeding from trach site, and
   psoas bleed found on CT as well as likely component of AOCD and renal
   insufficiency. Coumadin restarted prior to discharge and heparin d/c'd.
   - continue to trend
   - maintain active type and screen, IV access.
   # H/O DVT: BLE U/S most recently did not show DVT. Restarted warfarin
   [**9-5**].
   - holding coumadin now given supratherapeutic INR, monitor coags

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, VAP, and ARF. He was readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR. The patient underwent bronchoscopy to reposition his tracheostomy tube, which improved his ventilation and ABG. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a PICC line, multi-lumen line, and arterial line in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if his tracheostomy tube becomes dislodged or if he develops further respiratory compromise.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may progress, leading to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acid-base disturbances.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if he develops further bleeding or if his blood pressure medication is not optimized.
4. INR Elevation: The patient's INR may continue to elevate, potentially leading to bleeding complications if not managed appropriately.
5. VAP: The patient's VAP may worsen if his tracheostomy tube becomes dislodged or if he develops further respiratory compromise.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if he develops further bleeding or if his platelet count does not improve.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if his heart rate is not controlled, potentially leading to further cardiac complications.
8. Constipation: The patient's constipation may worsen if his bowel regimen is not optimized or if he develops further gastrointestinal complications.
9. Funguria: The patient's funguria may worsen if his fungal infection is not treated appropriately.
10. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if he develops further bleeding or if his hemoglobin level does not improve.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, including his oxygen saturation and respiratory rate.
2. Continue to optimize his tracheostomy tube and respiratory support as needed.
3. Monitor his renal function closely, including his blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.
4. Manage his hypotension with fluid boluses and blood pressure medication as needed.
5. Monitor his INR closely and adjust his warfarin dose as needed to prevent bleeding complications.
6. Continue to monitor his VAP and treat it aggressively with antibiotics and other therapies as needed.
7. Monitor his thrombocytopenia closely and adjust his platelet transfusion protocol as needed.
8. Continue to monitor his atrial fibrillation and control his heart rate as needed.
9. Monitor his constipation closely and adjust his bowel regimen as needed.
10. Continue to monitor his funguria and treat it aggressively with antifungal medication as needed.
11. Monitor his anemia closely and adjust his transfusion protocol as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved.
   - Thoracic to evaluate for new trach today.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra, vanco for now as below.
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 30 to 24 today.  Most likely source
   is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   improved.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - transfuse 1 U PRBC
   - trend Hct Q8hrs, goal > 25
   - maintain IV access
   - consider repeat CT if not improving
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD per tobra level.
   # Elevated INR:  On coumadin for paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on
   admission from 2.7 the day before likely from fluconazole/warfarin
   interaction.  Now resolved after Vitamin K.
   - resume coumadin with goal INR [**3-10**]
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - holding coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, continue to monitor
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved.
   - Thoracic to evaluate for new trach today.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra, vanco for now as below.
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 30 to 24 today.  Most likely source
   is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   improved.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - transfuse 1 U PRBC
   - trend Hct Q8hrs, goal > 25
   - maintain IV access
   - consider repeat CT if not improving
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD per tobra level.
   # Elevated INR:  On coumadin for paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on
   admission from 2.7 the day before likely from fluconazole/warfarin
   interaction.  Now resolved after Vitamin K.
   - resume coumadin with goal INR [**3-10**]
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - hold metoprolol in setting of hypotension
   - holding coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, continue to monitor
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   -Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, recently readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR. He has a tracheostomy tube in place and is receiving mechanical ventilation. His hemoglobin level has decreased to 25.7, and he is being transfused with packed red blood cells. His INR is elevated, and he is being monitored for bleeding. He has a history of atrial fibrillation and is taking warfarin. He is also being treated for resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP with tobramycin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if his tracheostomy tube is not properly secured or if his respiratory support is inadequate.
2. Bleeding: The patient's elevated INR and decreased hemoglobin level increase his risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of invasive procedures or trauma.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and he is at risk of nephrotoxicity from tobramycin.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of VAP and is at risk of developing further infections, particularly in the setting of his compromised immune system.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension increase his risk of cardiovascular instability, particularly if his cardiac function is compromised.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and his elevated INR increase his risk of further bleeding, particularly in the setting of stress ulcer prophylaxis.
7. Nephrotoxicity: The patient's renal function is impaired, and he is at risk of nephrotoxicity from tobramycin and other medications.
8. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's respiratory failure and decreased renal function increase his risk of developing metabolic acidosis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his respiratory support as necessary.
2. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin level and transfuse as necessary to maintain a hemoglobin level of at least 25.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's INR and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as necessary to maintain an INR of 3-10.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his medication regimen as necessary to minimize nephrotoxicity.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust his medication regimen as necessary to maintain hemodynamic stability.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust his medication regimen as necessary to minimize the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's metabolic status and adjust his medication regimen as necessary to minimize the risk of metabolic acidosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, VAP, and ARF. He is currently readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR. The patient's condition has improved significantly after repositioning of his tracheostomy tube with bronchoscopy. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, and his INR has improved.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is a significant concern, and the team should continue to monitor his oxygenation and ventilation. The patient's history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilation syndrome may increase his risk of respiratory failure.
2. Bleeding Complications: The patient's elevated INR and history of warfarin use may increase his risk of bleeding complications. The team should closely monitor his INR and bleeding risk.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is a concern, and the team should continue to monitor his urine output and BUN/Cr levels. The patient's history of AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension may increase his risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
4. Infection: The patient's history of VAP and ARF may increase his risk of infection. The team should continue to monitor his sputum cultures and chest x-rays to identify any potential infections.
5. Constipation: The patient's history of constipation may increase his risk of bowel obstruction and other complications. The team should continue to monitor his bowel movements and stool consistency.
6. Funguria: The patient's history of funguria may increase his risk of fungal infections. The team should continue to monitor his urine cultures and fungal susceptibility testing.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation may increase his risk of stroke and other cardiovascular complications. The team should continue to monitor his heart rhythm and anticoagulation status.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and the team should continue to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. Thoracic
   repositioned, no new trach.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra, vanco for now as below.
   .
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 30 to 24 today.  Most likely source
   is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   improved.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - transfuse 1 U PRBC
   - trend Hct Q8hrs, goal > 25
   - maintain IV access
   - consider repeat CT if not improving
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   .
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD per tobra level.
   - Consult ID about low vanc peak, what dosage they would recommend,
   duration of treatment
   .
   # Elevated INR:  On coumadin for paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on
   admission from 2.7 the day before likely from fluconazole/warfarin
   interaction.  Now resolved after Vitamin K.
   - resume coumadin with goal INR [**3-10**]
   .
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   .
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - Restart metoprolol if blood pressures tolerate
   - Restarted coumadin
   .
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   -Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
   .
   # Nails:
   - podiatry consult

   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, who was recently readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/51 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 27 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 96% on 40% FiO2. He is on a ventilator in CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode with a tidal volume of 520 mL, respiratory rate of 28, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.2 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 7.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 108 x 10^9/L. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 30 mg/dL, and his creatinine is 2.6 mg/dL. His liver function tests (LFTs) are normal, and his electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on warfarin, which may have contributed to his elevated INR. He also has a history of chronic renal failure and is on tobramycin for his resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This is likely due to his underlying lung disease and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. He has improved significantly after repositioning of his tracheostomy tube with bronchoscopy.
2. Hypotension: This has resolved with intravenous fluid (IVF) administration and is no longer requiring pressors.
3. Resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP: He is on tobramycin and will require continued monitoring and treatment.
4. Elevated INR: This is likely due to his warfarin therapy and has been resolved with vitamin K administration.
5. Anemia: This is likely due to blood loss and is being treated with transfusions.
6. Chronic renal failure: This is a known condition and will require ongoing monitoring and management.
7. Pain control: The patient is at risk for acute and chronic pain and will require ongoing pain management.
8. Impaired skin integrity: This is a risk due to his underlying medical conditions and will require ongoing monitoring and management.
9. Pneumonia, bacterial, ventilator-acquired (VAP): This is a known complication and will require continued monitoring and treatment.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue home albuterol, ipratropium, and beclomethasone.
2. Continue tobramycin and vancomycin for now.
3. Transfuse 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) to address anemia.
4. Trend hemoglobin every 8 hours and goal > 25.
5. Maintain IV access.
6. Consider repeat computed tomography (CT) if not improving.
7. Resume coumadin with a goal INR of 3-10.
8. Continue home bowel regimen to manage constipation.
9. Follow up with repeat urine culture to monitor for funguria.
10. Restart metoprolol if blood pressures tolerate and restart coumadin.
11. Monitor urine output and BUN/creatinine to monitor renal function.
12. Consult podiatry for nail care.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. Thoracic
   repositioned, no new trach.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra.
   - Pressure support, ABG after
   .
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 30 to 24 today.  Most likely source
   is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   improved.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - trend Hct Q8hrs, goal > 25
   - Stopped coumadin
 not tolerating anticoagulation
   - PO vit K 10mg
   - maintain IV access
   - CT of abdomen and pelvis without contrast
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   .
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD, increase dose to 150mg.
   - Check peak 1 hour after tobra, give for 5 more days
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Elevated INR:  On coumadin for paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on
   admission from 2.7 the day before likely from fluconazole/warfarin
   interaction.  Now resolved after Vitamin K.
   - d/c coumadin for active bleeding
   .
   # Constipation - Continue home bowel regimen
   .
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture

   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - Restart metoprolol if blood pressures tolerate.
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, readmitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR. The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple comorbidities, including chronic respiratory failure, chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and obesity hypoventilation syndrome.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Heart rate: 75 beats per minute (66-102 beats per minute)
* Blood pressure: 100/51 mmHg (68-148/93 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute (19-29 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%

The patient has a tracheostomy tube in place and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 520 mL and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.26, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 66 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 69 mmHg.

The patient has a history of VAP and ARF, and is currently receiving tobramycin for resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP. The patient's INR is elevated, and he is receiving vitamin K to reverse the effects of warfarin.

The patient's laboratory results show the following:

* White blood cell count: 8.2-8.6 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 24.9-25.9%
* Platelet count: 108-131 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 2.6-2.6 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 30-45 mg/dL
* Serum albumin: 2.5 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L

The patient's medical plan includes the following:

* Continue home albuterol, ipratropium, and beclomethasone
* Continue tobramycin for resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP
* Trend hematocrit every 8 hours, goal > 25%
* Stop coumadin and start vitamin K
* Maintain IV access
* CT of abdomen and pelvis without contrast
* Continue home bowel regimen
* Restart metoprolol if blood pressures tolerate
* Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
* No HD at this time, continue to monitor with increasing tobra dose

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome
* Renal failure due to chronic kidney disease and medication toxicity
* Bleeding complications due to elevated INR and platelet dysfunction
* Pneumonia due to VAP and antibiotic resistance
* Atrial fibrillation with increased risk of stroke and embolism
* Constipation due to chronic use of anticholinergic medications
* Nephrotoxicity due to tobramycin and other medications

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his medical plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. Thoracic
   repositioned, no new trach.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra 4 more days QOD dosing
   - trial pressure support, ABG after
   .
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 30 to 24 today.  Most likely source
   is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   improved.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - No evidence of new bleed
   - trend Hct Q8hrs, transfuse for under 25
   - Stopped coumadin
 not tolerating anticoagulation
   - if hct dropping, consider IV vit K
   - maintain IV access
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 6.5 L free water deficit
   - Starting D5W with K at 150ml/hour
   - Check PM lytes - give more D5W if needed
   - Watch glucose levels closely
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   .
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD, increase dose to 150mg.
   - Check peak 1 hour after tobra, give for 4 more days
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Elevated INR:  On coumadin for paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on
   admission from 2.7 the day before likely from fluconazole/warfarin
   interaction.  Now resolved after Vitamin K.
   - d/c coumadin for active bleeding
   - Check PM coags
   .
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - Restart metoprolol if blood pressures tolerate.
   - d/c anticoag due to bleed
   .
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   - Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
 No HD at this time, continue to monitor with
   increasing Tobra dose

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, who was recently readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR. The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic obstructive and restrictive lung disease, which is likely exacerbating his respiratory failure. He has been prescribed home medications, including albuterol, ipratropium, and beclomethasone, and is being trial-pressured with ABG after bronchoscopy.
2. Hct Drop: The patient's hemoglobin level is trending down, likely due to the known right retroperitoneal hematoma in the setting of elevated INR. The INR is currently improving, and there is no evidence of significant GI bleeding.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a 6.5 L free water deficit and is being treated with D5W with K at 150ml/hour.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved with IVF and he is off pressors.
5. Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: The patient has a resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP and is being treated with tobramycin.
6. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated due to the interaction between fluconazole and warfarin, and he has been treated with Vitamin K.
7. Funguria: The patient had a fungal infection, which was treated with fluconazole for 14 days, and is being followed up with repeat urine culture.
8. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation while in the MICU and is being treated with metoprolol.
9. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure and is at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
10. Anemia: The patient has anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding).
11. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure.
12. Pain Control: The patient has acute and chronic pain, which is being managed with medication.
13. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity.
14. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension, which has resolved with IVF.
15. Pneumonia: The patient has bacterial pneumonia, which is ventilator-acquired (VAP).

The patient is being treated with various medications, including tobramycin, metoprolol, and D5W with K, and is being monitored for various complications, including respiratory failure, renal failure, and anemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. Thoracic
   repositioned, no new trach.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra 4 more days QOD dosing
   - trial pressure support, ABG after
   .
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 30 to 24 today.  Most likely source
   is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   improved.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - No evidence of new bleed
   - trend Hct Q8hrs, transfuse for under 25
   - Stopped coumadin
 not tolerating anticoagulation
   - Given IV vitK for elevated INR
   - maintain IV access
   .
   # Hypernatremia: 6.5 L free water deficit
   - Starting D5W with K at 150ml/hour, increase as needed on repete lytes
   - Check PM lytes - give more D5W if needed
   - Watch glucose levels closely
   .
   # Tube feeds:
   - Restart slowly, check residuals
   - CXR
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   .
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD, increase dose to 150mg.
   - Check peak 1 hour after tobra, give for 4 more days
   - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # Elevated INR:  On coumadin for paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on
   admission from 2.7 the day before likely from fluconazole/warfarin
   interaction.  Now resolved after Vitamin K.
   - d/c coumadin for active bleeding
   - Check PM coags
   .
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR. He is already anticoagulated with
   supratherapeutic INR on warfarin.
   - Restart metoprolol if blood pressures tolerate.
   - d/c anticoag due to bleed
   .
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   - Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
 No HD at this time, continue to monitor with
   increasing Tobra dose

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, who was recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, VAP, and ARF, and is now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
* The patient has a persistent right retroperitoneal hemorrhage involving the iliacus and psoas muscle, which has not changed and shows no new areas of hemorrhage.
* The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which was rate-controlled with metoprolol during his previous admission.
* The patient has chronic anemia, chronic renal failure, and chronic pain.
* The patient has impaired skin integrity and hypotension, which was resolved with IV fluids.
* The patient has pneumonia, bacterial, ventilator-acquired (VAP), which was treated with tobramycin.
* The patient has acute kidney injury (AIN) and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from medication and hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Further bleeding from the retroperitoneal hemorrhage
* Worsening of the patient's respiratory failure
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Progression of the patient's chronic anemia
* Renal failure or worsening of chronic kidney disease
* Increased risk of nephrotoxicity from tobramycin
* Development of further skin breakdown or pressure ulcers
* Hypotension or shock
* Pneumonia or other respiratory complications
* Atrial fibrillation or other cardiac arrhythmias
* Pain management issues
* Increased risk of bleeding or hemorrhage due to the patient's anticoagulation status.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing home albuterol, ipratropium, and beclomethasone
* Continuing tobramycin for 4 more days
* Restarting metoprolol for atrial fibrillation
* Stopping coumadin due to active bleeding
* Restarting IV vitamin K for elevated INR
* Monitoring the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels
* Restarting tube feeds slowly and checking residuals
* Monitoring the patient's glucose levels closely
* Continuing to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjusting treatment as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   #Pain control- patient with ongoing large requirements of pain meds and
   anxiolytics. Transitioned over to standing methadone with prn dilaudid
   for long term pain control and a prn ativan for anxiety.
   Currently methadone 10mg NG TID and dilaudid 1-2mg IV q4h prn
   -continue to monitor opiate requirement.
   -may increase standing methadone dose if dilaudid required regularly
   for break through pain
   -change ativan to standing dose
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilation.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. Thoracic
   repositioned, no new trach.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - maintain on AC w/ ARDSnet Vt
   - continue tobra 3 more days QOD dosing
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD, increase dose to 150mg.
   - Check peak 1 hour after tobra, give for 4 more days
   - Appreciate ID recs
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
   # Hct drop:  Hct trending down from 25.2 to 23.4 today.  Most likely
   source is known RP hematoma in setting of elevated INR.  INR currently
   1.8.  No evidence of significant GI bleeding.
   - No evidence of new bleed
   - trend Hct Q12hrs, transfuse for under 25
   - maintain IV access
   -Coumadin stopped
   -SQ heparin @7500 TID for proph instead or coumadin
   - Check PM coags
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
   # Hypernatremia: 6.5 L free water deficit
   - continue D5W with K at 200 ml/hour, increase as needed and replete
   lytes
   -q4hr FSBG
   #L knee pain.  Pain to touch of L knee this AM.  No obvious sign of
   trauma.
   -3 view xray of L knee
   -brace for transport
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   - Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
 No HD at this time, continue to monitor with
   increasing Tobra dose
   # Tube feeds: Stopped yesterday for ? aspiration, restarted o/n
   - at goal, cont.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - [**9-12**] urine cx negative fungal cx
   #Atrial fibrillation: While in the MICU the patient developed
   intermittent A. fib last admission. He was rate controlled with
   metoprolol and was discharge din NSR.
   - Restart metoprolol if blood pressures tolerate.
   -coumadin stopped
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   #Trach site, sacral decub wounds.
   -follow wound care recs
   # Nails:

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, who was recently readmitted to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR. He has ongoing large requirements of pain meds and anxiolytics, and is being transitioned to standing methadone with prn dilaudid for long-term pain control and a prn ativan for anxiety. He has hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is being managed with home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone, and AC with ARDSnet Vt. He also has resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP, which is being treated with tobramycin. He has acute anemia, which is likely secondary to blood loss and elevated INR. He has hypernatremia, which is being managed with D5W and K at 200 ml/hour. He has L knee pain, which is being evaluated with a 3-view x-ray of the L knee. He has chronic renal failure, which is being monitored with UOP and BUN/Cr. He has impaired skin integrity, including trach site and sacral decub wounds, which are being managed with wound care recs.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is being managed, but there is a risk of further decompensation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has resistant pulmonary pseudomonas VAP, which may require further treatment and monitoring.
3. Anemia: The patient's acute anemia may worsen if bleeding continues or if there is inadequate transfusion support.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to further electrolyte imbalances if not managed properly.
5. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen if there is inadequate treatment or monitoring.
6. Skin integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to further complications, such as infection or tissue necrosis.
7. Pain management: The patient's ongoing pain requirements may lead to further complications, such as opioid dependence or tolerance.
8. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation may recur, leading to further cardiac complications.
9. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if there is inadequate treatment or monitoring.
10. Infection: The patient's history of VAP and other infections may lead to further complications, such as sepsis or organ failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 51-year-old male, is a readmission to the ICU with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR. He has a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease, VAP, and ARF. His current condition is complicated by acute pain, chronic pain, left knee pain, and potential DVT. He is on multiple medications, including tobramycin, heparin, and dilaudid, and is receiving IV fluids, tube feeds, and oxygen therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Left knee pain: The patient's left knee pain may be caused by a fracture, ligamentous injury, gout, septic arthritis, or DVT. Further evaluation, including imaging and fluid analysis, is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
2. Potential DVT: The patient's left knee pain and edema may be indicative of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A lower extremity venous ultrasound (LEUS) is necessary to evaluate for DVT.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) may be necessary to improve oxygenation.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be secondary to blood loss, and further evaluation, including a complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation studies, is necessary to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
5. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen if not properly managed. Close monitoring of urine output and serum creatinine is necessary to adjust tobramycin dosing and prevent nephrotoxicity.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may worsen if not properly managed. Close monitoring of serum sodium levels and urine output is necessary to adjust D5W administration and prevent further hypernatremia.
7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's tach and sacral decub ulcerations may worsen if not properly managed. Close monitoring and wound care are necessary to prevent further skin breakdown.
8. Fungal UTI: The patient's fungal UTI may worsen if not properly managed. Close monitoring of urine cultures and further treatment with antifungal medication may be necessary.
9. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not properly managed. Close monitoring of blood pressure and further treatment with vasopressors or fluids may be necessary.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   51 y/o male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive
   disease recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, VAP and ARF now readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory
   failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   #patient continued to require boluses of fentanyl.  Methadone increased
   to 10mg TID and dilaudid ordered to replace fentanyl boluses.  Ativan
   as prn anxiolytic.
   -follow dilaudid  requirement, increase methadone if regularly
   requiring dilaudid
   -continue ativan anxiolytic
L KNEE PAIN
   #New left knee pain noted today.  Pain with palpation, no obvious
   temperature difference, erythema or swelling.  Possible
   fracture/ligamentous injury vs gout vs septic arthritis vs DVT.  Pain
   in the region of previous DVT.
   - LENIs to eval for DVT
   - If LENIs negative tap knee for fluid analysis
   - if gout give steroids
   - if inf start abx
   - if all studies negative, order brace for patient transport for
   comfort
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
   # Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: generally due to obstructive and
   restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilatio.  Acute
   decompensation improved significantly after repositioning of trach with
   bronchoscopy.  ABG and patient comfort markedly improved. Thoracic
   repositioned, no new trach.
   - continue home albuterol, ipratropium, beclomethasone
   - continue tobra 4 more days QOD dosing
   - trial pressure support, ABG after
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, VENTILATOR ACQUIRED (VAP)
   # Resistant Pulmonary Pseudomonas VAP: On tobramycin.
   - Continue to dose QOD, increase dose to 150mg.
   - Check peak 1 hour after tobra, give for 4 more days
   - Appreciate ID recs
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
   # Hct drop:  Hct from 25.2 to 23.4 today.   Was on coumadin for
   paroxysmal AFib and DVT.  INR 7 on admission from 2.7 the day before
   likely from fluconazole/warfarin interaction.  Now resolved after
   Vitamin K. Most likely source is known RP hematoma in setting of
   elevated INR.  INR currently improved at 1.8.
   - trend Hct Q12hrs, transfuse for under 25
   - Stopped coumadin, started SC Heparin
   - maintain IV access
   - Check PM coags
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
   # Renal failure: Likely [**3-9**] AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension
   which is relatively stable from discharge. Renal has deferred HD since
   kidneys have started to recover.  Will need to continue to monitor as
   remains at risk of nephrotoxicity on tobramycin.
   - Monitor UOP and BUN/Cr
 No HD at this time, continue to monitor with
   increasing Tobra dose
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
   # Hypernatremia: 6.5 L free water deficit yesterday.  Received D5W and
   repleted K as needed.
   - Continue  D5W 200ml/hour, repete lytes as needed
   - Check PM lytes - give more D5W if needed
   - Watch glucose levels closely
ALTERED NUTRITION
   # Tube feeds: Restarted yseterday after TF coming out from around trach
   site.
    - Back at goals
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   # Hypotension: Resolved with IVF.  Off pressors
 Fungal UTI
   # Funguria: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
   - f/u repeat urine culture

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of severe mixed obstructive and restrictive disease, recently admitted with hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory failure, VAP, and ARF. The patient is currently readmitted with hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, and elevated INR.

The patient's current medical condition includes:

1. Knee pain: New left knee pain with palpation, no obvious temperature difference, erythema, or swelling, possible fracture/ligamentous injury, gout, septic arthritis, or DVT.
2. Respiratory failure: Hypercarbic respiratory failure due to obstructive and restrictive lung disease and obesity hypoventilation.
3. Pneumonia: Bacterial, ventilator-acquired (VAP), resistant to pulmonary pseudomonas, treated with tobramycin.
4. Anemia: Acute, secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding), likely due to known RP hematoma and elevated INR.
5. Renal failure: Chronic, likely due to AIN and ATN from medication and hypotension.
6. Hypernatremia: 6.5 L free water deficit yesterday, treated with D5W and repleted K as needed.
7. Altered nutrition: Tube feeds restarted yesterday after TF coming out from around trach site.
8. Hypotension: Resolved with IVF, off pressors.
9. Fungal UTI: Completed fluconazole x 14 days, last day [**2178-9-11**].
10. Impaired skin integrity: Tach and sacral decub ulcerations.

The patient's laboratory results show:

1. WBC: 9.7 K/uL
2. Hct: 24.1
3. Plt: 148
4. Cr: 2.4 mg/dL
5. TCO2: 35
6. Glucose: 104 mg/dL
7. Lactic Acid: 0.8 mmol/L
8. Albumin: 2.5 g/dL
9. LDH: 305 IU/L
10. Ca++: 8.3 mg/dL
11. Mg++: 2.0 mg/dL
12. PO4: 5.5 mg/dL

The patient's imaging results show:

1. LENI's: Normal

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Septic arthritis or osteomyelitis due to the knee pain and elevated white blood cell count.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's history of DVT and the presence of a PICC line.
3. Respiratory failure or pneumonia due to the patient's chronic obstructive and restrictive lung disease.
4. Anemia or bleeding due to the patient's chronic kidney disease and the presence of a PICC line.
5. Renal failure or acute kidney injury due to the patient's chronic kidney disease and the presence of a PICC line.
6. Hypernatremia or hyponatremia due to the patient's altered nutrition and fluid status.
7. Fungal or bacterial sepsis due to the patient's history of fungal UTI and the presence of a PICC line.
8. Impaired skin integrity or decubitus ulcers due to the patient's immobility and altered nutrition.

Based on the patient's current medical condition and potential complications, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's knee pain and consider imaging studies to rule out septic arthritis or osteomyelitis.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider adjusting the ventilator settings or antibiotics as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and consider transfusing blood products as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and consider adjusting the antibiotics or fluid status as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's hypernatremia and consider adjusting the fluid status or electrolyte levels as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's fungal or bacterial sepsis and consider adjusting the antibiotics or fluid status as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's impaired skin integrity and consider adjusting the wound care or nutrition as necessary.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of their multiple medical conditions to prevent potential complications and improve their clinical outcome."
