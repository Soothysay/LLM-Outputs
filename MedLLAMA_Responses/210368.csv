   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with hypotension/sepsis all concerning
   for cholangitis following one month of abdominal pain in the setting of
   decreased po intake and now with progressive dyspnea and peripheral
   edema.  Initially she was treated for UTI with bactrim with incomplete
   response.  She then evolved worsening abdominal discomfort and was
   found to have severe obstruction of biliary system with obstructing
   stone and was then transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further care in
   anticipation of ERCP and stone removal.
   1)ACUTE RENAL FAILURE-Patient above baseline and with sepsis has likely
   poor perfusion and resultant ATN
   -Follow urine output
   -Avoid nephrotoxic meds
   -Trend creatinine
   -Check urine lytes and urine sediment
   2)RESPIRATORY FAILURE--Patient intubated peri-procedure and had
   clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted.  We have evidence
   of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiraiton admitted to.  We have
   patient with wheezing and now with minimal resistance on ventilator all
   consistent with poor compliance and will need to work to wean
   ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
   -Will move to PSV when able
   -Continue with A/C
   SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION-_Likely related to biliary obstruction
   with cholecystitis and cholangitis with mass seen at papilla which
   suggests that obstruction may well be related to mass leading to
   obstruction and subsequent sepsis seen on exam.
   -AM cortisol normal
   -IVF given and CVP has improved
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl
cover for abdominal and possible pulmonary
   source
   -Will follow cultures and clinical course to look for resolution
   CHOLANGITIS
S/P ERCP
   -Stent placed
   -Will look to drainage
   -Will need pathology on mass as this will instruct long term
   intervention and treatment with concern for possible cholangiocarinoma.
   CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE-
   -Will need ECHO to follow up and define EF
   -Hold lasix and anti-hypertensive
   -Follow enzymes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis, cholangitis, respiratory failure, and congestive heart failure. The patient has a history of abdominal pain, decreased PO intake, and progressive dyspnea and peripheral edema.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.1°C (98.8°F)
* Heart rate: 112 bpm (96-119 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 104/41 mmHg (58-110/41-58 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14 inspirations per minute (14-31 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 99%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Cardiovascular: Tachycardia
* Respiratory/Chest: Diminished breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right lower extremity edema 2+, left lower extremity edema 2+, cool right extremity, and able to Doppler pulse but concerning for arterial compromise
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Responds to tactile stimuli, movement not assessed, tone not assessed

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.5-13.1 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 24.2-31.2%
* Platelet count: 117-152 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.1-1.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.02-0.05 ng/mL
* Glucose: 66-55 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.4/30.3/1.1, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 26/4/0.05, ALT/AST: 98/291, Alk Phos/T Bili: 794/5.3, Amylase/Lipase: 177/...

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CXR: Small left-sided effusion
* CT: Large gallstone

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Acute renal failure: Follow urine output, avoid nephrotoxic medications, trend creatinine, check urine lytes and urine sediment.
* Respiratory failure: Wean ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
* Sepsis without organ dysfunction: Cover for abdominal and possible pulmonary source with antibiotics, follow cultures and clinical course to look for resolution.
* Cholangitis: Stent placed, look to drainage, need pathology on mass as this will instruct long-term intervention and treatment with concern for possible cholangiocarcinoma.
* Congestive heart failure: Need ECHO to follow up and define EF, hold lasix and anti-hypertensive, follow enzymes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to sepsis and poor perfusion
* Respiratory failure due to poor compliance and weaning off ventilator support
* Cholangitis and cholecystitis worsening due to obstruction and sepsis
* Congestive heart failure worsening due to decreased cardiac function and fluid overload
* Sepsis spreading to other organs due to inadequate treatment and poor perfusion
* Renal failure worsening due to inadequate treatment and poor perfusion
* Pulmonary edema due to fluid overload and poor perfusion
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalance and decreased cardiac function
* Infection spreading to other parts of the body due to inadequate treatment and poor perfusion
* Organ dysfunction due to sepsis and poor perfusion"

   Imaging: TTE [**4-13**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
   cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   prominent epicardial fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   CXR [**4-13**]:
   FINDINGS: Progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left
   hemithorax,
   likely a combination of moderate pleural effusion and adjacent
   atelectasis or
   developing infectious pneumonia. Appearance of the chest is otherwise
   similar to the recent radiograph.
   CT head: wet read [**4-13**]:
   Area of 2.5 cm hypoattenuation in right frontal lobe concerning for
   neoplasm with vasogenic edema given history. Less likely to represent
   cytotoxic edema related to ischemia. MRI recommended if clinically
   feasible (pt in ICU, on pressors, etc).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient placed on vanc/cefepime/flagyl/zosyn
   - intubated for ercp, continued to be intubated in the unit after
   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning
   - on exam this AM @5:30, patient with dilated, fixed, dyscoric right
   pupil
   - heparin gtt held, stat head CT ordered

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. The patient underwent ERCP, which revealed a fungating 4cm mass in the papilla concerning for adenoCA. A biopsy of the mass was obtained, and a stent was placed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/48 mmHg. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 8.5-17.2 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 24.2-31.9%
* Platelet count: 107-152 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.8-2.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.02-0.05 ng/mL
* D-dimer: 4180 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 4.5 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.2 g/dL
* LDH: 1590 IU/L
* Calcium: 6.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.3 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
* CXR: Progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left hemithorax, likely a combination of moderate pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis or developing infectious pneumonia.
* CT head: Area of 2.5 cm hypoattenuation in the right frontal lobe concerning for neoplasm with vasogenic edema given history.

The patient's medical conditions include:

* AdenoCA with a fungating mass in the papilla
* Abdominal pain
* Hypotension
* Cyanosis of the right foot with weak Dopperable pulse
* Non-invasive arterial studies deferred due to machine breakdown
* Heparin gtt held for CVL line placement
* Possible thrombus in the right foot

The patient's medications include:

* Midazolam (Versed) 2 mg/hour
* Fentanyl (Concentrate) 125 mcg/hour
* Vasopressin 2.4 units/hour
* Norepinephrine 0.1 mcg/Kg/min
* Dextrose 50% 07:02 AM
* Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis) 08:00 AM
* Midazolam (Versed) 03:00 PM
* Fentanyl 03:00 PM

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis due to the fungating mass in the papilla
* Thromboembolic events due to the patient's cyanosis and weak Dopperable pulse
* Hypotension and shock due to the patient's hypovolemia and possible thrombus
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's mechanical ventilation and possible pneumonia
* Neurological complications due to the patient's head CT scan showing a large hypodensity in the right cortex

The patient's plan of care includes:

* ICU care with close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results
* Nutrition and glycemic control
* Line management and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer
* VAP prevention with HOB elevation and mouth care
* Further imaging studies to evaluate the patient's condition, including a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and a MRI of the brain."

   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with Likely related to biliary obstruction
   with cholecystitis and cholangitis with mass seen at papilla which
   suggests that obstruction may well be related to mass leading to
   obstruction and subsequent sepsis seen on exam.
   -AM cortisol normal
   -IVF given and CVP has improved
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl
cover for abdominal and possible pulmonary
   source
   -Will follow cultures and clinical course to look for resolution
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure and had
   clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted.  We have evidence
   of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiraiton admitted to.  We have
   patient with wheezing and now with minimal resistance on ventilator all
   consistent with poor compliance and will need to work to wean
   ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
   -Will move to PSV when able
   -Continue with A/C
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis and a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, concerning for malignancy. She underwent ERCP and had a stent placed. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, but she has been experiencing hypotension and tachycardia. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and creatinine levels. Imaging studies reveal a large hypodense lesion in the right frontal lobe, concerning for metastatic disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is likely related to the biliary obstruction and cholangitis. She is at risk for further sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to her intubation and mechanical ventilation. She may require further weaning from the ventilator and may be at risk for respiratory failure.
3. Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis is likely to worsen without treatment, and she may require further interventions such as antibiotics and bile duct stenting.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and urine electrolyte abnormalities suggest intrinsic renal failure. She may require further monitoring and treatment to prevent further kidney damage.
5. dCHF: The patient's TTE shows preserved EF, but she carries a clinical diagnosis of heart failure. She may require further monitoring and treatment to prevent further cardiac compromise.
6. GERD: The patient is at risk for further complications related to her GERD, such as aspiration and respiratory failure.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's hypodense lesion in the right frontal lobe may be related to metastatic disease, and she may require further imaging and monitoring to assess for neurological complications.
8. Thrombotic Complications: The patient's recent history of cyanosis and weak DP pulse in the right foot may indicate thrombotic complications, such as DVT or PE. She may require further monitoring and treatment to prevent further thrombotic events.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy to treat the patient's septic shock and cholangitis.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and wean her from the ventilator as soon as possible.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her medications and fluids as needed.
4. Consider further imaging studies to assess the patient's neurological status and potential metastatic disease.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust her medications and fluids as needed.
6. Consider further interventions to treat the patient's cholangitis, such as antibiotics and bile duct stenting.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely and consider further interventions to treat her GERD."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient placed on vanc/cefepime/flagyl/zosyn
   - intubated for ercp, continued to be intubated in the unit after
   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning
   - on exam this AM @5:30, patient with dilated, fixed, dyscoric right
   pupil

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis following one month of abdominal pain. The patient underwent ERCP, which demonstrated a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Septic Shock: The patient has likely septic shock related to biliary obstruction with cholecystitis and cholangitis, which may be related to the mass seen at the papilla, leading to obstruction and subsequent sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and has evidence of emesis peri-intubation, but no aspiration was admitted to. She has wheezing and minimal resistance on the ventilator, consistent with poor compliance. Weaning of ventilator support will be necessary in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
3. Cholangitis: The patient underwent ERCP and stent placement, and will need to be followed for drainage and pathology on the mass to determine long-term intervention and treatment.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has likely poor perfusion and resultant ATN due to sepsis and above baseline creatinine. Close monitoring of urine output, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications, and trending of creatinine will be necessary.
5. CHF: The patient will need an ECHO to follow up and define EF. Lasix and anti-hypertensive medications will be held, and enzymes will be followed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further deterioration of respiratory status, leading to increased ventilator support or failure.
2. Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Worsening of septic shock, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
4. Progression of cholangitis, leading to biliary obstruction or perforation.
5. Development of acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD).
6. Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy.
7. Development of cerebral edema or stroke due to hypotension or vasopressor therapy.
8. Worsening of cardiac function, leading to cardiac failure or arrhythmias.

The patient's family should be informed of the patient's condition and the potential complications that can arise. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU."

   Imaging: TTE [**4-13**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
   cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   prominent epicardial fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   CXR [**4-13**]:
   FINDINGS: Progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left
   hemithorax,
   likely a combination of moderate pleural effusion and adjacent
   atelectasis or
   developing infectious pneumonia. Appearance of the chest is otherwise
   similar to the recent radiograph.
   CT head: wet read [**4-13**]:
   Area of 2.5 cm hypoattenuation in right frontal lobe concerning for
   neoplasm with vasogenic edema given history. Less likely to represent
   cytotoxic edema related to ischemia. MRI recommended if clinically
   feasible (pt in ICU, on pressors, etc).

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with Likely related to biliary obstruction
   with cholecystitis and cholangitis with mass seen at papilla which
   suggests that obstruction may well be related to mass leading to
   obstruction and subsequent sepsis seen on exam.
   -AM cortisol normal
   -IVF given and CVP has improved
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl
cover for abdominal and possible pulmonary
   source
   -Will follow cultures and clinical course to look for resolution
   #
   1)ACUTE RENAL FAILURE-Patient above baseline and with sepsis has likely
   poor perfusion and resultant ATN
   -Follow urine output
   -Avoid nephrotoxic meds
   -Trend creatinine
   -Check urine lytes and urine sediment
   2)RESPIRATORY FAILURE--Patient intubated peri-procedure and had
   clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted.  We have evidence
   of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiraiton admitted to.  We have
   patient with wheezing and now with minimal resistance on ventilator all
   consistent with poor compliance and will need to work to wean
   ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
   -Will move to PSV when able
   -Continue with A/C
   CHOLANGITIS
S/P ERCP
   -Stent placed
   -Will look to drainage
   -Will need pathology on mass as this will instruct long term
   intervention and treatment with concern for possible cholangiocarinoma.
   CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE-
   -Will need ECHO to follow up and define EF
   -Hold lasix and anti-hypertensive
   -Follow enzymes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient placed on vanc/cefepime/flagyl/zosyn
   - intubated for ercp, continued to be intubated in the unit after
   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning
   - on exam this AM @5:30, patient with dilated, fixed, dyscoric right
   pupil
   - heparin gtt held, stat head CT ordered

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock secondary to cholangitis and a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy. The patient has undergone ERCP and a stent has been placed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and on ventilator support with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. The patient's SpO2 is 100% and the ABG results show a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 21, and PaO2 of 398.
* Cardiovascular: The patient is tachycardic with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 100/48 mmHg. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 11 mmHg and the patient's peripheral perfusion is poor.
* Neurological: The patient has a fixed, dilated right pupil and a left pupil that is equal, round, and reactive to light. The patient's mental status is altered and the patient is unable to follow commands.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of abdominal pain and has undergone ERCP. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal with elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.8 mg/dL and the patient's urine output is low.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Septic shock: The patient has septic shock secondary to cholangitis and a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy.
* Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure secondary to sepsis and poor perfusion.
* Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure secondary to sepsis and poor perfusion.
* Congestive heart failure: The patient has congestive heart failure secondary to sepsis and poor perfusion.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics: The patient is receiving antibiotics to cover for abdominal and possible pulmonary sources of infection.
* Vasopressors: The patient is receiving vasopressors to support blood pressure.
* Fluid management: The patient is receiving fluid management to support perfusion.
* Nutritional support: The patient is receiving nutritional support to support healing.
* Cardiovascular support: The patient is receiving cardiovascular support to support cardiac function.

The patient's prognosis is guarded due to the severity of the patient's illness and the presence of multiple medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   2)RESPIRATORY FAILURE--Patient intubated peri-procedure and had
   clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted.  We have evidence
   of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiraiton admitted to.  We have
   patient with wheezing and now with minimal resistance on ventilator all
   consistent with poor compliance and will need to work to wean
   ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis following ERCP. She had a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy. She was intubated for ERCP and failed a spontaneous breathing trial with an ABG of 7.18/38/92. She had a TTE showing normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, and trivial aortic regurgitation. She also had a CXR showing progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left hemithorax, likely due to a combination of moderate pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis or developing infectious pneumonia.

The patient had several medical complications, including:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level was above baseline, and she had sepsis, which may have resulted in ATN.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated peri-procedure and had evidence of emesis peri-intubation, but no aspiration admitted to. She had wheezing and minimal resistance on ventilator, consistent with poor compliance.
3. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient's sepsis was likely related to biliary obstruction with cholecystitis and cholangitis with mass seen at papilla.
4. Cholangitis: The patient had a stent placed after ERCP, and will need drainage and pathology on the mass to determine long-term intervention and treatment.
5. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient will need an ECHO to follow up and define EF, and will need to hold lasix and anti-hypertensive medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Increased risk of respiratory failure due to poor compliance and need for weaning from ventilator support.
2. Increased risk of acute kidney injury due to sepsis and potential ATN.
3. Increased risk of cardiovascular instability due to sepsis and potential congestive heart failure.
4. Increased risk of biliary obstruction and cholangitis due to the presence of a large fungating mass in the ampullary region.
5. Increased risk of septic shock due to ongoing sepsis and potential bacteremia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory values closely.
2. Continue to provide supportive care, including mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and antibiotics.
3. Consider performing a MRI to further characterize the mass and potential metastases.
4. Consider performing a pancreaticobiliary drainage procedure to alleviate biliary obstruction and reduce the risk of cholangitis.
5. Consider performing a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma and determine the best course of treatment."

   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient placed on vanc/cefepime/flagyl/zosyn
   - intubated for ercp, continued to be intubated in the unit after
   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning
   - on exam this AM @5:30, patient with dilated, fixed, dyscoric right
   pupil
   - heparin gtt held, stat head CT ordered

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock from cholangitis following ERCP, demonstrating a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy. The patient has undergone ERCP, biopsy of the mass, and stenting of the ampulla. The patient's condition has been complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, ischemia to her extremities, and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after restarting heparin.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
* Heart rate: 120 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 100/48 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Leukocytosis: 8.5-17.2 x 10^9/L
* Thrombocytopenia: 107-152 x 10^9/L
* Anemia: 24.0%
* Elevated lactate: 4.5 mmol/L
* Elevated creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL
* Elevated liver enzymes: ALT 72 IU/L, AST 249 IU/L, Alk Phos 579 IU/L
* Elevated troponin: 0.05 ng/mL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT head: hypodense lesion in the right frontal lobe concerning for metastatic lesion
* TTE: normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, trivial aortic regurgitation
* CXR: progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left hemithorax, likely a combination of moderate pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis or developing infectious pneumonia

The patient's medical complications include:

* Septic shock
* Limb ischemia
* Respiratory failure
* Cholangitis
* Acute renal failure with non-gap acidosis
* Anemia
* Thrombocytopenia
* dCHF (diastolic heart failure)
* GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Herniation or brainstem lesion
* Toxic or metabolic process
* Intrinsic process likely ATN (acute tubular necrosis)
* Nephrotoxic medication toxicity
* DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation)

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics
* IV fluids
* Pressors (Levophed and Vasopressin)
* Heparin
* Pentoxyphylline
* Ranitidine
* Lasix
* Lopressor
* IV steroids
* Mannitol
* Hyperventilation
* Consultation with Neurology and Vascular Surgery

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU."

   Imaging: TTE [**4-13**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
   cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   prominent epicardial fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   CXR [**4-13**]:
   FINDINGS: Progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left
   hemithorax,
   likely a combination of moderate pleural effusion and adjacent
   atelectasis or
   developing infectious pneumonia. Appearance of the chest is otherwise
   similar to the recent radiograph.
   CT head: wet read [**4-13**]:
   Area of 2.5 cm hypoattenuation in right frontal lobe concerning for
   neoplasm with vasogenic edema given history. Less likely to represent
   cytotoxic edema related to ischemia. MRI recommended if clinically
   feasible (pt in ICU, on pressors, etc).
   Microbiology: Urine cx [**4-12**]: no growth

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Neurosurgery consult
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids
   - No anticoagulation for now
   - Family meeting
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with leukocytosis, tachycardia, biliary
   infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring 2
   pressors. SVO2 94%. CVP 11. Lactate elevated to 4.5. this AM. Patient
   is currently on Levophed and Vasopressin as well as broad-spectrum
   antibiotics. WBC improved this AM, but clinically remains severely ill
   and unresponsive.
   - Continue IVF boluses
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Start Pentoxyphylline 400mg daily (for renal dosing)
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C
   - Repeat ABG
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - IVF
s PRN
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # dCHF: Patient with TTE demonstrating preserved EF, but no E/E or E/A
   ratio obtained to assess for diastolic dysfunction. However, patient
   carries clinical diagnosis of heart failure.
   -Holding home Lasix 40mg PO BID and Lopressor 25mg PO BID
   -Follow enzymes
   # GERD: Patient on PPI at home.
   - Continue Ranitidine 150mg PO daily for ppx

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Neurosurgery consult
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids
   - No anticoagulation for now

   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Start Pentoxyphylline 400mg daily (for renal dosing)
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C

   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis following one month of abdominal pain. She underwent ERCP, which demonstrated a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy. The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple comorbidities, including acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and limb ischemia. She is currently intubated and on pressors, and has a fixed, dilated right pupil, which is concerning for herniation or brainstem lesion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cerebral herniation: The patient's fixed, dilated right pupil and hypodense lesion in the right frontal lobe on CT scan suggest the possibility of cerebral herniation.
2. Sepsis-related organ failure: The patient's septic shock, acute kidney injury, and respiratory failure suggest the possibility of sepsis-related organ failure.
3. Limb ischemia: The patient's cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally suggest the possibility of limb ischemia.
4. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and hypoxemia suggest the possibility of ARDS.
5. Cardiac failure: The patient's TTE demonstrating preserved EF, but no E/E or E/A ratio obtained to assess for diastolic dysfunction, suggests the possibility of cardiac failure.
6. Cholangitis-related complications: The patient's cholangitis and fungating mass in the ampullary region may lead to complications such as cholangitis-related sepsis, cholangitis-related pancreatitis, or cholangitis-related liver failure.

Recommendations:

1. Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting heparin gtt.
2. F/U Neurology recs.
3. Neurosurgery consult.
4. Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids.
5. No anticoagulation for now.

   Imaging: TTE [**4-13**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
   cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   prominent epicardial fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   CXR [**4-13**]:
   FINDINGS: Progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient placed on vanc/cefepime/flagyl/zosyn
   - intubated for ercp, continued to be intubated in the unit after
   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning
   - on exam this AM @5:30, patient with dilated, fixed, dyscoric right
   pupil
   - heparin gtt held, stat head CT ordered

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis following ERCP. She has a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, concerning for malignancy, and has undergone ERCP with stenting. She has been intubated and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. She has developed limb ischemia, respiratory failure, acute renal failure with non-gap acidosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. She has also had a right frontal lobe hypodense lesion on CT scan, concerning for metastatic lesion, and has developed a fixed, dilated pupil on the right side.

Potential medical complications:

1. Herniation: The patient's pupillary defect and fixed, dilated pupil on the right side may indicate herniation, which is a life-threatening condition.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to be weaned from the ventilator and her poor compliance on the ventilator may indicate respiratory failure.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's rising creatinine and non-gap acidosis may indicate acute renal failure, which is a life-threatening condition.
5. Limb ischemia: The patient's cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally may indicate limb ischemia, which can lead to tissue necrosis and gangrene.
6. Anemia: The patient's worsening anemia may indicate ongoing blood loss or inadequate transfusion.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may indicate ongoing bleeding or inadequate platelet support.
8. Cholangitis: The patient's cholangitis may progress to cholestatic liver disease or liver failure if not treated promptly.
9. Malignancy: The patient's large fungating mass in the ampullary region may indicate malignancy, which can spread to other parts of the body if not treated promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting heparin gtt.
2. F/U Neurology recs.
3. Head of bed elevation >30 degrees.
4. Consider Mannitol and IV Steroids.
5. Hyperventilate if e/o for herniation and consult Neurosurgery.
6. No anticoagulation for now.
7. Family meeting.
8. Continue IVF boluses.
9. Continue pressors.
10. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics.
11. F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN.
12. Start Pentoxyphylline 400mg daily (for renal dosing).
13. Follow UOP.
14. Avoid nephrotoxic medications.
15. Renally dose all medications.
16. Trend creatinine.
17. [**Hospital1 7**] lytes.
18. Active T&S.
19. PIV s in place.
20. Transfuse 1u pRBC s given end organ ischemia and possible improved volume resuscitation.
21. [**Hospital1 7**] Hct.
22. Continue to trend.
23. Hold home Lasix 40mg PO BID and Lopressor 25mg PO BID.
24. Follow enzymes.
25. Continue Ranitidine 150mg PO daily for ppx."

   Imaging: TTE [**4-13**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
   cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   prominent epicardial fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   CXR [**4-13**]:
   FINDINGS: Progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with Likely related to biliary obstruction
   with cholecystitis and cholangitis with mass seen at papilla which
   suggests that obstruction may well be related to mass leading to
   obstruction and subsequent sepsis seen on exam.
   -AM cortisol normal
   -IVF given and CVP has improved
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl
cover for abdominal and possible pulmonary
   source
   -Will follow cultures and clinical course to look for resolution
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure and had
   clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted.  We have evidence
   of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiraiton admitted to.  We have
   patient with wheezing and now with minimal resistance on ventilator all
   consistent with poor compliance and will need to work to wean
   ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
   -Will move to PSV when able
   -Continue with A/C
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP
   -Stent placed
   -Will look to drainage
   -Will need pathology on mass as this will instruct long term
   intervention and treatment with concern for possible cholangiocarinoma.
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with baseline Cr of 1.1, currently Cr
   1.8 in context of sepsis and poor perfusion. UOP initially poor
   (~20cc/hr), but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may
   indicate improved end-organ perfusion.
   -Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   -Check urine lytes and urine sediment
   # dCHF: Patient with TTE demonstrating preserved EF, but no E/E or E/A
   ratio obtained to assess for diastolic dysfunction. However, patient
   carries clinical diagnosis of heart failure.
   -Holding home Lasix 40mg PO BID and Lopressor 25mg PO BID
   -Follow enzymes
   # GERD: Patient on PPI at home.
   - Continue Ranitidine 150mg PO daily for ppx

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with Likely related to biliary obstruction
   with cholecystitis and cholangitis with mass seen at papilla which
   suggests that obstruction may well be related to mass leading to
   obstruction and subsequent sepsis seen on exam.
   -AM cortisol normal
   -IVF given and CVP has improved
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl
cover for abdominal and possible pulmonary
   source
   -Will follow cultures and clinical course to look for resolution
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure and had
   clearance of mucus plug and improved wheezing noted.  We have evidence
   of emesis peri-intubation but no aspiraiton admitted to.  We have
   patient with wheezing and now with minimal resistance on ventilator all
   consistent with poor compliance and will need to work to wean
   ventilator support as possible in the setting of treatment for sepsis.
   -Will move to PSV when able
   -Continue with A/C
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP
   -Stent placed
   -Will look to drainage
   -Will need pathology on mass as this will instruct long term
   intervention and treatment with concern for possible cholangiocarinoma.
   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with baseline Cr of 1.1, currently Cr
   1.8 in context of sepsis and poor perfusion. UOP initially poor
   (~20cc/hr), but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may
   indicate improved end-organ perfusion.
   -Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   -Check urine lytes and urine sediment
   # dCHF: Patient with TTE demonstrating preserved EF, but no E/E or E/A
   ratio obtained to assess for diastolic dysfunction. However, patient
   carries clinical diagnosis of heart failure.
   -Holding home Lasix 40mg PO BID and Lopressor 25mg PO BID
   -Follow enzymes

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock secondary to cholangitis and a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy. She underwent ERCP, which demonstrated the mass and a stent was placed. She was intubated for the procedure and remains intubated due to respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with cholangitis, acute renal failure, and dCHF. She has also developed a right frontal lobe hypodense lesion consistent with metastatic disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is likely related to the biliary obstruction and cholangitis. Continued monitoring and treatment are necessary to prevent further complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely related to her underlying lung disease and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation. Weaning from the ventilator will be challenging due to her poor compliance.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely related to her sepsis and poor perfusion. Close monitoring of her creatinine and urine output is necessary to prevent further decline.
4. dCHF: The patient's dCHF is likely related to her underlying heart disease. Close monitoring of her cardiac enzymes and symptoms is necessary to prevent further decline.
5. Metastatic Disease: The patient's right frontal lobe hypodense lesion is consistent with metastatic disease. Further evaluation with MRI is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of disease.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's fixed, dilated pupil is concerning for a neurological complication. Further evaluation with an EEG and MRI is necessary to determine the cause of the pupil dilation.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's cholangitis and cholecystitis increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications such as perforation, abscess, and sepsis.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's dCHF and septic shock increase her risk of cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
9. Infection: The patient's sepsis and respiratory failure increase her risk of infection. Close monitoring of her temperature, white blood cell count, and other laboratory values is necessary to detect early signs of infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and imaging studies to detect early signs of complications.
2. Continue to treat the patient's septic shock with IV fluids, vasopressors, and antibiotics.
3. Wean the patient from the ventilator as soon as possible to prevent respiratory failure.
4. Monitor the patient's creatinine and urine output closely to prevent further decline in renal function.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and symptoms to prevent further decline in cardiac function.
6. Obtain an EEG and MRI to further evaluate the patient's neurological symptoms.
7. Consider consulting a neurologist or oncologist to further evaluate the patient's neurological and oncological symptoms.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's temperature, white blood cell count, and other laboratory values to detect early signs of infection.
9. Consider consulting a cardiologist to further evaluate the patient's cardiovascular symptoms."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient placed on vanc/cefepime/flagyl/zosyn
   - intubated for ercp, continued to be intubated in the unit after
   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock from cholangitis following ERCP. She has a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy. Her hospital course has been complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, ischemia to her extremities, and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after heparin gtt. She is currently on pressors, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and has a pending head CT scan.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cerebral herniation: The patient's right frontal lobe hypodensity lesion and fixed, dilated pupil suggest the possibility of cerebral herniation, which is a life-threatening complication.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and rising lactate levels indicate ongoing sepsis, which requires aggressive management to prevent further organ dysfunction.
3. Limb ischemia: The patient's cool, mottled, and cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally suggest limb ischemia, which may be due to thrombosis or embolism.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's rising creatinine levels and non-gap acidosis suggest acute kidney injury, which may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or nephrotoxic medications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be due to sepsis, DIC, or medications.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be due to blood loss, sepsis, or medications.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's poor compliance on the ventilator and rising PCO2 levels suggest respiratory failure, which may be due to sepsis, pneumonia, or ARDS.
8. Cholangitis: The patient's large fungating mass in the ampullary region suggests cholangitis, which requires aggressive management to prevent further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Repeat stat head CT scan to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting heparin gtt.
2. F/U Neurology recs.
3. Consider Mannitol and IV Steroids for cerebral edema.
4. Hyperventilate if e/o for herniation and consult Neurosurgery.
5. Hold off on percutaneous chole drainage for now, but can revisit after results of head CT.
6. Continue IVF boluses and pressors.
7. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics.
8. F/U cultures and adjust regimen PRN.

   Fluid analysis / Other labs: GI biopsy [**4-13**]: pending
   CBD brushing [**4-13**]: pending
   Imaging: TTE [**4-13**]: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in
   cavity size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   prominent epicardial fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   CXR [**4-13**]:
   FINDINGS: Progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left
   hemithorax,
   likely a combination of moderate pleural effusion and adjacent
   atelectasis or
   developing infectious pneumonia. Appearance of the chest is otherwise
   similar to the recent radiograph.
   CT head: wet read [**4-13**]:
   Area of 2.5 cm hypoattenuation in right frontal lobe concerning for
   neoplasm with vasogenic edema given history. Less likely to represent
   cytotoxic edema related to ischemia. MRI recommended if clinically
   feasible (pt in ICU, on pressors, etc).
   Microbiology: Urine cx [**4-12**]: no growth
   Blood cx [**Date range (1) 6470**]: pending
   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral right pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Head of bed elevation >30 degrees
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids
   - Hyperventilate if e/o for herniation & consult Neurosurgery
   - No anticoagulation for now
   - Family meeting
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with leukocytosis, tachycardia, biliary
   infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring 2
   pressors. SVO2 94%. CVP 11. Lactate elevated to 4.5. this AM. Coags all
   prolonged with existing thrombocytopenia & anemia.  Fibrinogen 324.
   Patient is currently on Levophed and Vasopressin as well as
   broad-spectrum antibiotics. WBC improved this AM, but clinically
   remains severely ill and unresponsive. Surgery recommending bedside RUQ
   U/S & IR percutaneous chole drainage
   - Hold off on perc drainage for now, but can revisit after results of
   head CT
   - Continue IVF boluses
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   - F/U Final Surgery recs
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Start Pentoxyphylline 400mg daily (for renal dosing)
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C
   - Repeat ABG
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy. LFT
s trending down.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - IVF
s PRN
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Anemia: Patient with worsening anemia to 24.0 this AM after
   significant blood loss from attempted CVL yesterday in addition to
   significant fluid boluses.
   - Active T&S
   - PIV
s in place
   - Transfuse 1u pRBC
s given end organ ischemia & possible improved
   volume resuscitation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis, following ERCP demonstrating a large fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy. She has undergone ERCP, biopsy of the mass, and placement of an ampullary stent. The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure and has been on pressors to manage her blood pressure. She has also developed limb ischemia, with cool, mottled, and cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of the legs.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels. Her coagulation profile is abnormal, with prolonged PT, PTT, and INR, and thrombocytopenia. Her electrolyte levels are abnormal, with elevated potassium and decreased sodium. Her renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 15 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show a large hypoattenuation in the right frontal lobe, concerning for neoplasm, and a CT scan of the head shows a 2.5 cm hypoattenuation in the right frontal lobe, consistent with a metastatic lesion.

The patient's medical history is significant for heart failure, and her physical examination shows tachycardia, hypotension, and bilateral pedal edema.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock is ongoing, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
3. Limb ischemia: The patient's limb ischemia is ongoing, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal function is impaired, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
5. Heart failure: The patient's heart failure is ongoing, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
6. Malignancy: The patient's biopsy of the mass is pending, and there is a risk of further spread of the malignancy.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Continue to manage the patient's septic shock with antibiotics and pressors.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's limb ischemia and adjust therapy as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust therapy as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's heart failure and adjust therapy as needed.
7. Consider further imaging studies to evaluate the extent of the malignancy.
8. Consider further neurological evaluation to evaluate the patient's neurological status.
9. Consider further discussion with the patient's family regarding code status and disposition."

   regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
   structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a
   prominent epicardial fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   CXR [**4-13**]:
   FINDINGS: Progressive worsening of opacity in the lower left
   hemithorax,
   likely a combination of moderate pleural effusion and adjacent
   atelectasis or

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   - patient placed on vanc/cefepime/flagyl/zosyn
   - intubated for ercp, continued to be intubated in the unit after
   failing a SBT with ABG 7.18/38/92
   - ercp demonstrated fungating 4cm mass seen in papilla concerning for
   adenoCA
   - biopsy of mass obtained, stent placed
   - cyanosis of right foot with weak dp pulse on doppler, arterial
   non-invasives ordered but machine broken, so deferred
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by in AM, recommended heparin gtt which was started
   - patient initially off pressors, but Levophed restarted at ~3pm for
   hypotension & cvp of 13 despite fluid boluses
   - heparin gtt held for CVL line placement, line attempted at subclav &
   IJ, unable to place, CXR did not demontrate pneumothorax or hematoma
   - TTE: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global and
   regional biventricular systolic function. Trivial aortic regurgitation.
   - vasc [**Doctor First Name 213**] came by again in the evening, by then, the patient had no
   dopperable dp pulse in the right foot, recommended restarting heparin
   gtt for now given likely thrombus
   - given concern for mental status off sedation, pan-CT scan ordered
   including head before restarting heparin gtt, pre-hydration/mucomyst
   started in anticipation of imaging
   - 8:30PM, patient with biliary vomiting, OG tube placed
   - SVO2 = 94%
   - patient with low UOP, SBP's - maxed out Levophed at 10PM, started on
   Vasopressin 2.4u/hr
   - patient later had head CT that showed large hypodensity in right
   cortex
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - levophed slowly weaned to 0.05 by early morning
   - on exam this AM @5:30, patient with dilated, fixed, dyscoric right
   pupil
   - heparin gtt held, stat head CT ordered

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis following an ERCP procedure. She has a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, concerning for malignancy. She has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. She has a history of abdominal pain, and her laboratory results show leukocytosis, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels. She has also developed a right frontal lobe hypodense lesion, which is concerning for a metastatic lesion. She has a fixed, dilated pupil on the right side, which is concerning for herniation or brainstem lesion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's septic shock is not responding to treatment, and she requires two pressors to maintain blood pressure. She has a high lactate level, and her coagulation profile is abnormal.
2. Limb Ischemia: The patient has cool, mottled, and cyanotic toes and feet, and her vascular surgeon has recommended heparin therapy. However, heparin was initially held due to the risk of bleeding, and it was restarted after a neurology consultation. The patient's bilateral plantar surfaces of the feet are also mottled.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and has poor compliance on the ventilator. She has a high arterial oxygen tension and a low partial pressure of carbon dioxide.
4. Acute Renal Failure with Non-Gap Acidosis: The patient has a high creatinine level and a low urine output, suggesting intrinsic renal failure. Her urine electrolytes show a high fractional excretion of sodium, suggesting an intrinsic process.
5. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, which is likely due to blood loss from the attempted central venous line placement and fluid boluses.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which is likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
7. dCHF: The patient has a clinical diagnosis of heart failure, but her echocardiogram shows preserved ejection fraction. However, her cardiac enzymes are elevated.
8. GERD: The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is taking ranitidine.

Plan:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for cholangitis.
2. Hold off on percutaneous cholecystostomy drainage for now.
3. Continue IV fluids and pressors to maintain blood pressure.
4. Restart heparin therapy if the head CT is negative for hemorrhage.
5. Consider nitroglycerin paste on the extremities to counteract the effect of pressors.
6. Continue with ARDSnet parameters to manage respiratory failure.
7. Follow up on the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia with transfusions and laboratory tests.
8. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and consider adjusting her medications for heart failure.
9. Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP precautions.
10. Consider a family meeting to discuss the patient's condition and prognosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Neurosurgery consult
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids

   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Start
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C
   - Repeat ABG
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy.

   # Acute Renal Failure: Patient with baseline Cr of 1.1, currently Cr
   1.8 in context of sepsis and poor perfusion. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock due to cholangitis following an ERCP procedure. She has a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, concerning for malignancy, and has undergone ERCP, biopsy, and stenting. She has developed bilateral limb ischemia, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. She has also developed a right frontal lobe hypodense lesion, concerning for metastatic disease, and has a fixed, dilated pupil on the right side.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Brain herniation: The patient's fixed, dilated pupil on the right side and hypodense lesion in the right frontal lobe may indicate a risk of brain herniation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's septic shock and continued hypotension despite pressors may indicate ongoing sepsis.
3. Limb ischemia: The patient's cool, mottled, and cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally may indicate limb ischemia, which may worsen if not treated promptly.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's poor compliance on the ventilator and continued need for pressors may indicate ongoing respiratory failure.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's increasing creatinine levels and urine electrolytes suggesting intrinsic process likely ATN may indicate worsening acute renal failure.
6. Cholangitis: The patient's ongoing cholangitis and sepsis may lead to further complications, such as liver failure, biliary obstruction, or abscess formation.
7. Malignancy: The patient's large fungating mass in the ampullary region, concerning for malignancy, may indicate a poor prognosis and a need for further treatment.

Plan:

1. Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting heparin gtt.
2. F/U Neurology recs.
3. Neurosurgery consult.
4. Consider Mannitol and IV Steroids.
5. No anticoagulation for now.
6. Family meeting.
7. Continue IVF boluses, pressors, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
8. F/U cultures and adjust regimen PRN.
9. F/U Vascular surgery recs.
10. Start anticoagulation therapy after Neurology consultation.
11. Continue with A/C and repeat ABG.
12. F/U biopsy results and continue broad-spectrum antibiotics.
13. Follow UOP and avoid nephrotoxic medications.
14. Renally dose all medications and trend creatinine.
15. Hold home Lasix and Lopressor and follow enzymes.
16. Continue Ranitidine 150mg PO daily for ppx.
17. ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female with iniital admission with sepsis and cholangitis found
   to have concerning mass lesion in ampulla consistent with
   adenocarcinoma and course complicated by persistent sepsis and
   respiratory failure with evolution of limb ischemia and persistent
   altered mental status.
   1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])-This is secondary to
   severe metabolic acidosis with associated respiratory failure in the
   setting fo bilateral effusions.
   -Will continue with support with optimized ventilatory support
   -Will need to consider patient at high risk for evolution of ARDS
   -We will see continued need for maintenance of effective ventilation to
   look to sedate patient to tolerate effective ventilation.
   -Will look to maintain Ve at 8-10 with Vt at 6cc/Kg at this time
   -Will need titration to ABG across the day
   2) SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION-Persistent and severe compromise in
   perfusion despite CVP at >12 and requiring 2 pressors and now adding a
   3^rd.  ScVO2 has been >90%, we have CVP at 12 this morning.  This is
   all consistent with severe vasodilatory state with distributative shock
   with concern for infection from possible biliary source and or possible
   pneumonia.  We will need to reverse infection with
   -Evaluation with radiology to consider percutaneous drainage of
   gallbladder system
   -Pulmonary opacities are seen with collapse suggested in LLL with
   associated bilateral infusions
   -Will maintain support with pressors
   -Antibiotics with vanco/cefepime/Zosyn/Flagyl
   -Will utilize pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure support.

   5)CHOLANGITIS-_We have stent placed with drainage but now with
   persistent and severe sepsis.  We do not see clear evidence of
   persistent obstruction but will have to consider imaging with radiology
   to consider drainage in light of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female admitted with sepsis, cholangitis, and respiratory failure. The patient's condition has worsened over time, with persistent sepsis, respiratory failure, and altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's severe metabolic acidosis and bilateral effusions increase the risk of developing ARDS.
2. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's persistent sepsis and vasodilatory state may lead to organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and coagulopathy.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's metabolic acidosis and hypotension increase the risk of developing AKI.
4. Hepatic failure: The patient's cholangitis and sepsis may lead to hepatic failure, which can exacerbate the patient's metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
5. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate cardiovascular instability, which can worsen the patient's condition.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and hypodensity on CT scan may indicate neurological complications, such as cerebral edema or hemorrhage.
7. Limb ischemia: The patient's absent distal pulses and mottled appearance of the extremities suggest limb ischemia, which may require urgent revascularization.
8. Infection: The patient's persistent sepsis and cholangitis increase the risk of developing further infections, such as pneumonia or bacteremia.
9. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy and the presence of a large left-sided effusion increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications, such as hemothorax or hemopericardium.

Given the patient's severe and acute worsening condition, the prognosis appears to be poor, and the likelihood of evolution to death is high."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy, and a
   hospital course complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation & ischemia
   to her extremities, now found to have right frontal lobe hypodense
   lesion c/w metastatic lesion and a new right fixed, dilated pupil after
   heparin gtt.
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral right pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Head of bed elevation >30 degrees
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids
   - Hyperventilate if e/o for herniation & consult Neurosurgery
   - No anticoagulation for now
   - Family meeting
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with leukocytosis, tachycardia, biliary
   infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring 2
   pressors. SVO2 94%. CVP 11. Lactate elevated to 4.5. this AM. Coags all
   prolonged with existing thrombocytopenia & anemia.  Fibrinogen 324.
   Patient is currently on Levophed and Vasopressin as well as
   broad-spectrum antibiotics. WBC improved this AM, but clinically
   remains severely ill and unresponsive. Surgery recommending bedside RUQ
   U/S & IR percutaneous chole drainage
   - Hold off on perc drainage for now, but can revisit after results of
   head CT
   - Continue IVF boluses
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   - F/U Final Surgery recs
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally. Can restart if head CT negative for
   hemorrhage.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Consider Nitro paste on extremities to counteract effect of pressors
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C with ARDSnet parameters given risk of ARDS
   - Repeat ABG
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy. LFT
s trending down.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - IVF
s PRN
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Anemia: Patient with worsening anemia to 24.0 this AM after
   significant blood loss from attempted CVL yesterday in addition to
   significant fluid boluses.
   - Active T&S
   - PIV
s in place
   - Transfuse 1u pRBC
s given end organ ischemia & possible improved
   volume resuscitation
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient with small PLT drop to 107 this AM from 117
   on admission.
   - DIC labs as above
   - Continue to trend
   # dCHF: Patient with TTE demonstrating preserved EF, but no E/E or E/A
   ratio obtained to assess for diastolic dysfunction. However, patient
   carries clinical diagnosis of heart failure.
   -Holding home Lasix 40mg PO BID and Lopressor 25mg PO BID
   -Follow enzymes
   # GERD: Patient on PPI at home.
   - Continue Ranitidine 150mg PO daily for ppx

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] Admission: Septic Shock s/p ERCP
   24 Hour Events:
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - progressively more hypotensive, maxed out on neo, levo, and
   vasopressin
   - on exam this AM @5:30, concern patient with dilated, fixed right
   pupil so heparin stopped but head CT was stable
   - plan to replace CVL, RIJ vs. subclavian but given worsening clinical
   status, this was deferred
   - CT-CAP: 1. 6mm RUL nodule, 2. extensive mediastinal LAD suggestive of
   lymphoma, 3. b/l pleural effusion with atelectasis, 4. cholelithiasis,
   5. splenic infarcts, 6. renal infarct, umbilical hernia with hyperdense
   lesion likely barium in diverticulum vs strangulated epiploic
   appendigitis.
   - path prelim read: high-grade poorly differentiated malignant tumor,
   but possibly lymphoma vs. carcinoma vs less likely melanoma.  stains
   pending
   - family meeting --> patient made DNR/DNI with no escalation of care
   - started on bicarb drip for worsening metabolic acidosis
   - heparin restarted
   - steroids started for empiric treatment of lymphoma and for refractory
   shock
   - added on tumor lysis labs given starting steroids.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock secondary to cholangitis following an ERCP procedure. She has a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, concerning for malignancy.

The patient's current condition is complex and multisystemic, with the following potential medical complications:

1. Neurological compromise: The patient has a right frontal lobe hypodense lesion, which may be a metastatic lesion. She has also developed a fixed, dilated right pupil, which is concerning for herniation or brainstem lesion. Neurology is following, and a repeat stat head CT is recommended to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting heparin.
2. Septic shock: The patient has leukocytosis, tachycardia, biliary infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses, requiring two pressors. Her coagulation profile is abnormal, with prolonged PT, PTT, and INR, and thrombocytopenia and anemia.
3. Limb ischemia: The patient has cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally, as well as some mottling of the right hand. Vascular surgery is consulted, and heparin is restarted after the discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower extremities bilaterally.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and unable to be weaned from the ventilator after failing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). She has poor compliance on the ventilator, and an ABG shows a pH of 7.11.
5. Cholangitis: The patient has a 10cm fungating mass at the ampulla, concerning for malignancy. Biopsy of the mass is pending, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are continued.
6. Acute renal failure with non-gap acidosis: The patient has a rising creatinine level, and her urine electrolytes show a FeNa of 2.08, suggesting an intrinsic process likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
7. Anemia: The patient has a worsening anemia, likely due to significant blood loss from attempted central venous line (CVL) placement and fluid boluses.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a small platelet drop, likely due to sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
9. dCHF: The patient has a clinical diagnosis of heart failure, despite a preserved ejection fraction on echocardiogram.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is to remain in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy,
   complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, limb ischemia, right
   frontal lobe ? metastasis, now on maximum doses of three pressors.
   Family meeting yesterday established severity of condition and grave
   prognosis, patient made DNR.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with worsening leukocytosis, tachycardia,
   biliary infection, and hypotension requiring 3 pressors, unresponsive
   to IVF boluses. CVP 18. Lactate elevated to 7.0 this AM. Patient is
   currently on Levophed, Vasopressin and Phenylephrine as well
   vanc/cefepime/flagyl.  Family would like to gather to readdress goals
   of care.
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   - F/U Final Surgery recs
   - family meeting, may make patient CMO and withdraw supportive
   measures.
   # Coma: likely [**2-24**] sepsis, also with new ? brain mets.  Appreciate
   neuro input, though further neuro w/u deferred given overall prognosis.
   - f/u neuro recs
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Likely [**2-24**] pressor, though also possible thrombus, given
   initial unilateral presenation, renal and splenic infacts on ct.
   - heparin gtt
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Currently hypercarbic on LTTV.
   - Continue with A/C with ARDSnet parameters
   - increase Tv to increase pH, decrease pCO2
   - Repeat ABG
   # Ampulllary Mass/Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy: path from ampulla showed
   high grade undifferentiated malignant tumor.  Mediastinal LAD
   susp[icious for lymphoma.  Regardless, given current clinical scenario,
   cancer diagnosis only contributes to a grim prognosis, and further w/u
   unnecessary.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - steroids
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy,
   complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, limb ischemia, right
   frontal lobe ? metastasis, now on maximum doses of three pressors.
   Family meeting yesterday established severity of condition and grave
   prognosis, patient made DNR.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with worsening leukocytosis, tachycardia,
   biliary infection, and hypotension requiring 3 pressors, unresponsive
   to IVF boluses. CVP 18. Lactate elevated to 7.0 this AM. Patient is
   currently on Levophed, Vasopressin and Phenylephrine as well
   vanc/cefepime/flagyl.  Family would like to gather to readdress goals
   of care.
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   - F/U Final Surgery recs
   - family meeting, may make patient CMO and withdraw supportive
   measures.
   # Coma: likely [**2-24**] sepsis, also with new ? brain mets.  Appreciate
   neuro input, though further neuro w/u deferred given overall prognosis.
   - f/u neuro recs
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Likely [**2-24**] pressor, though also possible thrombus, given
   initial unilateral presenation, renal and splenic infacts on ct.
   - heparin gtt
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Currently hypercarbic on LTTV.
   - Continue with A/C with ARDSnet parameters
   - increase Tv to increase pH, decrease pCO2
   - Repeat ABG
   # Ampulllary Mass/Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy: path from ampulla showed
   high grade undifferentiated malignant tumor.  Mediastinal LAD
   susp[icious for lymphoma.  Regardless, given current clinical scenario,
   cancer diagnosis only contributes to a grim prognosis, and further w/u
   unnecessary.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - steroids
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - continue bicarbonate gtt
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   - Trend creatinine, lytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour admission to the ICU with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. The patient has a history of septic shock following ERCP and has been experiencing worsening clinical status, with increasing hypotension, despite maximal vasopressor support. The patient has been diagnosed with a high-grade poorly differentiated malignant tumor, with pending pathology results. The patient has been started on steroids for empirical treatment of lymphoma and for refractory shock. The patient has also been started on bicarbonate drip for worsening metabolic acidosis.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 98.6°F (37°C)
* Heart rate: 132 bpm
* Blood pressure: 146/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 32 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 19.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 130 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 87 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 7.1 mmol/L
* D-dimer: 4180 ng/mL

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Septic shock and organ dysfunction

   24 Hour Events:
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - progressively more hypotensive, maxed out on neo, levo, and
   vasopressin
   - on exam this AM @5:30, concern patient with dilated, fixed right
   pupil so heparin stopped but head CT was stable
   - plan to replace CVL, RIJ vs. subclavian but given worsening clinical
   status, this was deferred
   - CT-CAP: 1. 6mm RUL nodule, 2. extensive mediastinal LAD suggestive of
   lymphoma, 3. b/l pleural effusion with atelectasis, 4. cholelithiasis,
   5. splenic infarcts, 6. renal infarct, umbilical hernia with hyperdense
   lesion likely barium in diverticulum vs strangulated epiploic
   appendigitis.
   - path prelim read: high-grade poorly differentiated malignant tumor,
   but possibly lymphoma vs. carcinoma vs less likely melanoma.  stains
   pending
   - family meeting --> patient made DNR/DNI with no escalation of care
   - started on bicarb drip for worsening metabolic acidosis

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy,
   complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, limb ischemia, right
   frontal lobe ? metastasis, now on maximum doses of three pressors.
   Family meeting yesterday established severity of condition and grave
   prognosis, patient made DNR.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with worsening leukocytosis, tachycardia,
   biliary infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring 3
   pressors. SVO2 94%. CVP 11. Lactate elevated to 7.0 this AM. Coags all
   prolonged with existing thrombocytopenia & anemia.  Fibrinogen 324.
   Patient is currently on Levophed, Vasopressin and Phenylephrine as well
   vanc/cefepime/flagyl.  Critically
   - Hold off on perc drainage for now, but can revisit after results of
   head CT
   - Continue IVF boluses
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   - F/U Final Surgery recs
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral right pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Head of bed elevation >30 degrees
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids
   - Hyperventilate if e/o for herniation & consult Neurosurgery
   - No anticoagulation for now
   - Family meeting
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally. Can restart if head CT negative for
   hemorrhage.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Consider Nitro paste on extremities to counteract effect of pressors
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C with ARDSnet parameters given risk of ARDS
   - Repeat ABG
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy. LFT
s trending down.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - IVF
s PRN
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Anemia: Patient with worsening anemia to 24.0 this AM after
   significant blood loss from attempted CVL yesterday in addition to
   significant fluid boluses.
   - Active T&S
   - PIV
s in place
   - Transfuse 1u pRBC
s given end organ ischemia & possible improved
   volume resuscitation
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient with small PLT drop to 107 this AM from 117
   on admission.
   - DIC labs as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Chief Complaint: Abdominal Pain
   [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] Admission: Septic Shock s/p ERCP
   24 Hour Events:
   - curbsided Neuro for hypodensities & they recommended MRI to further
   characterize mets vs. stroke before anticoagulating - they later came
   by and staffed the case and recommended heparinizing the patient with
   repeat head CT in 12 hours, an EEG in the morning, and MRI w&w/out as
   above
   - progressively more hypotensive, maxed out on neo, levo, and
   vasopressin
   - on exam this AM @5:30, concern patient with dilated, fixed right
   pupil so heparin stopped but head CT was stable
   - plan to replace CVL, RIJ vs. subclavian but given worsening clinical
   status, this was deferred
   - CT-CAP: 1. 6mm RUL nodule, 2. extensive mediastinal LAD suggestive of
   lymphoma, 3. b/l pleural effusion with atelectasis, 4. cholelithiasis,
   5. splenic infarcts, 6. renal infarct, umbilical hernia with hyperdense
   lesion likely barium in diverticulum vs strangulated epiploic
   appendigitis.
   - path prelim read: high-grade poorly differentiated malignant tumor,
   but possibly lymphoma vs. carcinoma vs less likely melanoma.  stains

   Assessment and Plan
   75 yo female admitted from OSH with septic shock from cholangitis
   following one month of abdominal pain now s/p ERCP demonstrating large
   fungating mass in the ampullary region concerning for malignancy,
   complicated by unresponsiveness off sedation, limb ischemia, right
   frontal lobe ? metastasis, now on maximum doses of three pressors.
   Family meeting yesterday established severity of condition and grave
   prognosis, patient made DNR.
   # Septic Shock:  Patient with worsening leukocytosis, tachycardia,
   biliary infection, and hypotension unresponsive to boluses requiring 3
   pressors. SVO2 94%. CVP 11. Lactate elevated to 7.0 this AM. Coags all
   prolonged with existing thrombocytopenia & anemia.  Fibrinogen 324.
   Patient is currently on Levophed, Vasopressin and Phenylephrine as well
   vanc/cefepime/flagyl.  Critically
   - Hold off on perc drainage for now, but can revisit after results of
   head CT
   - Continue IVF boluses
   - Continue pressors
   - Continue Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Zosyn
   - F/U cultures adjust regimen PRN
   - F/U Final Surgery recs
   # Coma: Patient unresponsive off sedation following ERCP yesterday, now
   with impaired unilateral right pupillary light reflex concerning for
   herniation or brainstem lesion given known hypodensity in the right
   frontal lobe & timing of heparin gtt onset and loss of pupillary
   response. Its unilateral appearance make a toxic or metabolic process
   less likely, but there is no clear midline shift on CT to support
   herniation. Neurology is following.
   - Repeat stat head CT to evaluate for new hemorrhage after restarting
   heparin gtt
   - F/U Neurology recs
   - Head of bed elevation >30 degrees
   - Consider Mannitol & IV Steroids
   - Hyperventilate if e/o for herniation & consult Neurosurgery
   - No anticoagulation for now
   - Family meeting
   # Limb ischemia: Patient with cool, mottled, cyanotic toes and
   bilateral plantar surfaces of LE bilaterally as well as some mottling
   of the right hand. Vascular surgery consulted yesterday for cool right
   foot and recommended Heparin gtt. Heparin initially given, but held for
   CVL placement. Restarted after Neurology consult recommended restarting
   despite known hypodense cortical lesion, but stopped again after
   discovery of pupillary defect despite lack of dp pulses in lower
   extremities bilaterally. Can restart if head CT negative for
   hemorrhage.
   - F/U Vascular surgery recs
   - Consider Nitro paste on extremities to counteract effect of pressors
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated peri-procedure, unable to be
   weaned from vent after failing SBT. Patient demonstrated poor
   compliance on ventilator.  AM ABG 7.4/21/159/13.
   - Continue with A/C with ARDSnet parameters given risk of ARDS
   - Repeat ABG
   # Cholangitis: s/p ERCP demonstrating 10cm fungating mass at the
   ampulla, now with ampullary stent. Biopsy of mass pending, but
   concerning for malignancy. LFT
s trending down.
   - F/U biopsy results
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics
   - IVF
s PRN
   # Acute Renal Failure w/ non-gap acidosis: Patient with baseline Cr of
   1.1, currently Cr 1.8 in context of sepsis, rising lactate, and poor
   perfusion. Non-gap likely due to receipt of HCO3. Urine electrolytes
   demonstrated FeNa of 2.08, suggestive of intrinsic process likely ATN.
   Urine sediment with 3-5 hyaline casts. UOP initially poor (~20cc/hr),
   but since 3AM, UOP has improved ~50-100cc/hr that may indicate improved
   end-organ perfusion.
   - Follow UOP
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications
   - Renally dose all medications
   -Trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Anemia: Patient with worsening anemia to 24.0 this AM after
   significant blood loss from attempted CVL yesterday in addition to
   significant fluid boluses.
   - Active T&S
   - PIV
s in place
   - Transfuse 1u pRBC
s given end organ ischemia & possible improved
   volume resuscitation
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   # Thrombocytopenia: Patient with small PLT drop to 107 this AM from 117
   on admission.
   - DIC labs as above
   - Continue to trend
   # dCHF: Patient with TTE demonstrating preserved EF, but no E/E or E/A
   ratio obtained to assess for diastolic dysfunction. However, patient
   carries clinical diagnosis of heart failure.
   -Holding home Lasix 40mg PO BID and Lopressor 25mg PO BID

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female admitted to the ICU with septic shock secondary to cholangitis and a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, concerning for malignancy. The patient has a grave prognosis and has made a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decision.

The patient's condition is deteriorating, with worsening leukocytosis, tachycardia, and hypotension, requiring maximum doses of three pressors. The patient has also developed limb ischemia, cool, mottled, and cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of the lower extremities, and a right frontal lobe hypodensity, which may be a metastasis.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

1. Septic shock: The patient's condition is worsening, and the patient is at risk of further deterioration.
2. Coma: The patient is unresponsive off sedation, and there is a concern for herniation or brainstem lesion given the known hypodensity in the right frontal lobe.
3. Limb ischemia: The patient has cool, mottled, and cyanotic toes and bilateral plantar surfaces of the lower extremities, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and unable to be weaned from the ventilator, and there is a risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Cholangitis: The patient has a large fungating mass in the ampullary region, and there is a concern for malignancy.
6. Acute renal failure with non-gap acidosis: The patient has a rising creatinine level and a non-gap acidosis, which may be due to receipt of bicarbonate.
7. Anemia: The patient has a worsening anemia, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a small platelet drop, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
9. dCHF: The patient has a clinical diagnosis of heart failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
10. GERD: The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and there is a risk of further deterioration.

The patient is currently receiving a number of treatments, including antibiotics, pressors, and IV fluids. The patient is also being monitored closely for signs of deterioration, and the healthcare team is working to manage the patient's condition and prevent further complications."

   75 yo female admitted with chlangitis and now with refractory septic
   shock in the setting of extensive and widespread adenopathy concerning
   for widespread malignancy.  She has had persistent sepsis with
   inability to return to meaningful perfusion of tissues as evidenced by
   continued rise in lactate.  We have persistent acidemia despite
   maximized support on the ventilator and utilization of the bicarbonate
   drip.
   1)RESPIRATORY FAILURE-
   -Will continue with A/C support
   -We have continued to maintain low tidal volume ventilation as
   protective strategy to minimize ARDS risk
   2) SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION-
   -Steroids in place
   -Pressors at maxium
   -Broad spectrum antibiotics in place
   -Ongoing fluid bolus without effect of durable response in terms of
   blood pressure stability.
   3)Cholangitis-Patient with mass lesion obstructing biliary system with
   stent drainage in place which has local control but we are left with
   diffuse and extensive cancer
   -Continue drainage
   4)Acidemia-
   -Persistent anion gap acidosis with optimization of vent support
   -Will need to continue with HCO3- gtt

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 75-year-old female admitted with cholangitis and refractory septic shock in the setting of extensive and widespread adenopathy concerning for widespread malignancy. She has had persistent sepsis with inability to return to meaningful perfusion of tissues, as evidenced by continued rise in lactate. Despite maximized support on the ventilator and utilization of the bicarbonate drip, she has persistent acidemia. The patient is on pressor support, steroids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. She has a mass lesion obstructing the biliary system with stent drainage in place, which has local control but is left with diffuse and extensive cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is on mechanical ventilation with a high FiO2. There is a risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to the low tidal volume ventilation strategy.
2. Sepsis with Organ Dysfunction: The patient's sepsis is refractory, and she has persistent acidemia despite maximized support. There is a risk of developing organ dysfunction, including renal and hepatic failure.
3. Cholangitis: The patient has a mass lesion obstructing the biliary system, which is causing cholangitis. There is a risk of further deterioration of her liver function and development of liver failure.
4. Malignancy: The patient has widespread adenopathy and diffuse high-grade malignancy, which is a poor prognostic indicator. There is a risk of further progression of her cancer and development of metastases.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiovascular status is critical, and she is on pressor support. There is a risk of developing cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a mass lesion obstructing the biliary system, which is causing cholangitis. There is a risk of further gastrointestinal complications, including pancreatitis and intestinal obstruction.
7. Infections: The patient has a high risk of developing secondary infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs).
8. Hemorrhagic Complications: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases her risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.
9. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status is critical, and she is at risk of developing neurological complications, including seizures and stroke.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential medical complications."
