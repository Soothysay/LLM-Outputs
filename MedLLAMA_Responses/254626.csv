You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 58-year-old female, was extubated and reintubated due to increased somnolence and inadequate airway protection. She has been on ventilator support with a FiO2 of 50% and a Vt of 400-450 mL. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.46, pCO2 of 36, and pO2 of 444. She has been weaned off Levo and is currently on Heparin Sodium and Propofol infusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen due to her recent reintubation and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged ventilation and reintubation may increase her risk of developing VAP.
3. Sepsis: The patient's recent antibiotic administration and potential bacterial colonization may lead to sepsis.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's chronic heart failure may worsen due to her recent respiratory instability and potential cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation and potential gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to gastrointestinal complications.
6. Thrombosis: The patient's prolonged immobility and potential hypercoagulability may increase her risk of developing thrombosis.
7. Infection: The patient's recent antibiotic administration and potential bacterial colonization may lead to infection.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient's prolonged sedation and potential neurological instability may lead to neurological complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as necessary.
2. Consider administering antibiotics to prevent VAP and sepsis.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medication as necessary to prevent cardiac complications.
4. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust medication as necessary to prevent gastrointestinal complications.
5. Consider administering thromboprophylaxis to prevent thrombosis.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust sedation as necessary to prevent neurological complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CHF with an EF of 30%, COPD, and known AAA. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, and her current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient was reintubated due to desaturation and increased respiratory distress after extubation. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 49, and PaO2 of 444. Her respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 18, and FiO2 of 50%.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has known CAD with multiple MIs, and her most recent echo showed an EF of 15-20%. She is currently in atrial fibrillation with a controlled heart rate.
* Neurological status: The patient is sedated and not assessed for movement, tone, or sensation.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is 111/70 mmHg, and her heart rate is 86 bpm.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require continued mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's known CAD and atrial fibrillation put her at risk for cardiac complications, including MI, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
* Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and lack of assessment for neurological function make it difficult to determine the extent of any potential neurological deficits.
* Infectious complications: The patient's respiratory failure and prolonged ICU stay increase her risk for developing pneumonia, VAP, and other infections.
* Metabolic complications: The patient's diabetes and hyperglycemia require close monitoring and management to prevent complications such as DKA and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome.
* Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is slightly low, and her heart rate is slightly elevated, which may indicate hemodynamic instability and the need for further monitoring and management.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue mechanical ventilation and respiratory support
* Monitor and manage cardiovascular status, including atrial fibrillation and CAD
* Monitor and manage neurological status, including sedation and potential neurological deficits
* Monitor and manage hemodynamic status, including blood pressure and heart rate
* Monitor and manage metabolic status, including glucose control and electrolyte balance
* Monitor and manage infectious risk, including pneumonia and VAP
* Consider further workup and biopsy of the lung mass concerning for malignancy"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient weaned from ventilator and extubated around 6pm.  Patient
   seemed increasingly somnolent after extubation, not protecting her
   airway.  ABG: 7.25/86/76/39.  Reintubated patient at 9pm.
   Attempted A-line --> unsuccessful.
   This AM, repeat ABG showed 7.46/49/444/36.  Vent settings adjusted
   (decreased FiO2, decreased TV, increased RR).
   Patient intermittently on Levo --> weaned off at midnight.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and known abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypoxia and reduced ejection fraction.

The patient's respiratory status has been a concern, with a diagnosis of respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes COPD exacerbation, community-acquired pneumonia, and pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia or hypertension. The patient's lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and the chest X-ray is not grossly overloaded. The laboratory results show a contraction alkalosis, which suggests that the patient is not diuresing.

The patient's cardiac status is also a concern, with a known history of coronary artery disease and systolic heart failure with a baseline ejection fraction of 30%. The most recent echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15-20%. The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, which is well-controlled. The patient's INR is 1.4, and she is being anticoagulated with warfarin and heparin drip.

The patient's neurologic status is also a concern, with a history of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, and she is being treated with insulin and oral medications.

The patient's electrolyte status is also a concern, with a sodium level of 130 prior to transfer. The patient has a new lung nodule, which is concerning for malignancy. The patient's urine electrolyte levels are being sent, and the patient is being repleted with electrolytes as needed.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are also abnormal, with elevated AST and ALT levels. The patient's creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 36 mg/dL.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, and the patient may require mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is complex, and the patient may be at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
3. Neurologic complications: The patient's neurologic status is a concern, and the patient may be at risk for further neurologic complications such as stroke or seizures.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte status is a concern, and the patient may be at risk for electrolyte imbalances that can lead to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
5. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and the patient may be at risk for further liver dysfunction or liver failure.
6. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and the patient may be at risk for further kidney dysfunction or kidney failure.
7. Malignancy: The patient has a new lung nodule, which is concerning for malignancy. The patient may require further evaluation and treatment for this condition.
8. Infection: The patient's WBC count is elevated, and the patient may be at risk for infection. The patient's blood cultures and sputum cultures are pending.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current condition, the patient requires close monitoring and management by the healthcare team to prevent and manage potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CHF with an EF of 30%, COPD, known AAA who
   presented to OSH with hypoxia and reduced EF, now extubated.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Differential includes COPD exacerbation,
   community acquired pneumonia, vs. pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia
   or HTN. Patient currently appears euvolemic.  Lungs clear to
   auscultation bilaterally. CXR not grossly overloaded. Chem 7 appears to
   be contraction alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.
   -f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures (negative to date)
   -Continue nebs, solumedrol for presumed COPD exacerbation (Given IV
   solumedrol 80mg [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.)
   -Continue Azithromycin for 5 day course empiric atypical PNA given
   increased WBC count this AM; although no infiltrate on OSH chest CT,
   thick secretions yesterday.  Will stop ceftriaxone
   - Extubated today
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p multiple MIs. We do not have
   these records in our system. Outpatient cardiologist at [**Hospital 9079**]
   clinic.  Ruled out for MI during this admission.
   -Continue ASA, statin, Lisinopril
   -Hold BB in the setting of recent hypotension
 will consider
   restarting in the future if BP stable
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has known systolic heart failure with baseline EF of
   30%. Most recent echo showed EF of 15-20%.  Unclear why she has
   worsening systolic function, but should have TTE as an outpatient once
   her acute issues have resolved. Ruled out for ischemia at OSH. Patient
   currently appears euvolemic on exam. Chem 7 suggests contraction
   alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.
   - Continue Lisinopril
   - Follow I/Os, with goal even
   - Continue home Digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM:  currently in atrial fibrillation, rate well controlled. Afib
   with RVR induced by levophed at OSH. As a result, patient was loaded
   with IV amiodarone. Most recent INR 1.4.
   - Adjust Heparin sliding scale per correct weight.
   -Continue to anticoagulate with Warfarin, recheck INR.  CHAD2 score is
   3
 6% annual stroke risk from age, chf, dm so benefits from continued
   anticoagulation
   - Initiate Diltiazem 30mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Neuro deficits by history, most likely TIA.
   - consider carotid dopplers, likely as outpatient.
   - full neuro exam when off sedation
   .
   # DM2: Unclear outpatient regimen. However with steroids, sugars have
   been elevated. Question of Lantus dose at OSH, currently adequate sugar
   control on SSI without need for long acting insulin.
   -Discontinue Glargine as pt not requiring, and not on Glargine at home
   - Continue SSI
   -qid fingersticks
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 130 prior to transfer, currently resolved. Appears
   euvolemic. Patient has new lung nodule, concerning for malignancy, but
   given resolution of Na, unlikely to be SIADH.
   .
   # Transaminitis with elevated AST, ALT:  Resolving.  She underwent an
   abdominal ultrasound which revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC
   likely representing increased right heart pressure. AAA was noted at
   4.8 x 4.7 cm. Her crestor was held.
   .
   #.  Spiculated 1.8 cm lung mass in the right apical segment concerning
   for malignancy:
   - This will need a biopsy and further workup once acute issues have
   resolved.
   - Will notify pt and family once patient stabilized and out of the ICU
       .
   FEN:  Diabetic, heart healthy, low sodium diet. No IV fluids. Replete
   lytes PRN.
   .
   ACCESS: L IJ, may be pulled once pt stable after extubation.  PIV in
   place.
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip
   -Pain management with
   -Bowel regimen with  Miralax
   - GI PPx for high dose steroid use
   .
   CODE: DNR, confirmed with HCP at OSH. Patient already intubated. Okay
   with central lines and pressors.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 23**] or health care proxy.
   Total time spent on patient care: 35 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Critically ill due to hypoxic respiratory failure, acute on chronic
   systolic CHF, altered mental status, atrial fibrillation.
   Date/time of service 9/28/9 at 1130.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 174**] [**Name (NI) **], MD
   on:[**2184-11-1**] 16:43 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CHF with an EF of 30%, COPD, known AAA, who presented to the hospital with hypoxia and reduced EF. She was intubated and is currently extubated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 130/64 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 400 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 114 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging studies show a CXR with an orogastric tube coil within the stomach and no microorganisms seen in the sputum culture.

The patient's diagnosis is respiratory failure, likely due to COPD exacerbation, community-acquired pneumonia, or pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia or hypertension. The patient's treatment plan includes nebs, solumedrol, and azithromycin for presumed COPD exacerbation, and heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis.

The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a normal sinus rhythm and no signs of ischemia or infarction. Her cardiac medications include ASA, statin, and lisinopril.

The patient's neurologic status is stable, with no signs of worsening neurologic deficits. Her blood glucose levels are elevated, but she is receiving insulin therapy.

The patient's liver function tests show mild transaminitis, which is resolving. Her abdominal ultrasound shows dilated hepatic veins and IVC, likely representing increased right heart pressure.

The patient's lung mass is concerning for malignancy, and a biopsy and further workup are planned once her acute issues have resolved.

The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated sodium level of 130 mEq/L, which is likely due to her hyponatremia.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and she has a healthcare proxy who has been informed of her condition.

The patient's disposition is to the CCU for further care and management.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying COPD and pulmonary edema.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but she may still be at risk for cardiac complications due to her underlying CHF and atrial fibrillation.
3. Neurologic complications: The patient's neurologic status is stable, but she may still be at risk for neurologic complications due to her underlying diabetes and hypertension.
4. Infection: The patient's sputum culture is negative, but she may still be at risk for infection due to her underlying respiratory failure and immunocompromised state.
5. Malignancy: The patient's lung mass is concerning for malignancy, and further workup and treatment may be necessary.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but she may still be at risk for electrolyte imbalances due to her underlying medical conditions and medications.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is slightly elevated, but she may still be at risk for hyponatremia due to her underlying medical conditions and medications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CHF with an EF of 30%, COPD, known AAA who
   presented to OSH with hypoxia and reduced EF, now extubated.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Differential includes COPD exacerbation,
   community acquired pneumonia, vs. pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia
   or HTN. Patient currently appears euvolemic.  Lungs clear to
   auscultation bilaterally. CXR not grossly overloaded. Chem 7 appears to
   be contraction alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.
   -f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures (negative to date)
   -Continue nebs, solumedrol for presumed COPD exacerbation (Given IV
   solumedrol 80mg [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.)
   -Continue Azithromycin for 5 day course empiric atypical PNA given
   increased WBC count this AM; although no infiltrate on OSH chest CT,
   thick secretions yesterday.  Will stop ceftriaxone
   - Extubated today
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p multiple MIs. We do not have
   these records in our system. Outpatient cardiologist at [**Hospital 9079**] clinic.
    Ruled out for MI during this admission.
   -Continue ASA, statin, Lisinopril
   -Hold BB in the setting of recent hypotension
 will consider
   restarting in the future if BP stable
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has known systolic heart failure with baseline EF of
   30%. Most recent echo showed EF of 15-20%.  Unclear why she has
   worsening systolic function, but should have TTE as an outpatient once
   her acute issues have resolved. Ruled out for ischemia at OSH. Patient
   currently appears euvolemic on exam. Chem 7 suggests contraction
   alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.
   - Continue Lisinopril
   - Follow I/Os, with goal even
   - Continue home Digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM:  currently in atrial fibrillation, rate well controlled. Afib
   with RVR induced by levophed at OSH. As a result, patient was loaded
   with IV amiodarone. Most recent INR 1.4.
   - Adjust Heparin sliding scale per correct weight.
   -Continue to anticoagulate with Warfarin, recheck INR.  CHAD2 score is
   3
 6% annual stroke risk from age, chf, dm so benefits from continued
   anticoagulation
   - Initiate Diltiazem 30mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Neuro deficits by history, most likely TIA.
   - consider carotid dopplers, likely as outpatient.
   - full neuro exam when off sedation
   .
   # DM2: Unclear outpatient regimen. However with steroids, sugars have
   been elevated. Question of Lantus dose at OSH, currently adequate sugar
   control on SSI without need for long acting insulin.
   -Discontinue Glargine as pt not requiring, and not on Glargine at home
   - Continue SSI
   -qid fingersticks
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 130 prior to transfer, currently resolved. Appears
   euvolemic. Patient has new lung nodule, concerning for malignancy, but
   given resolution of Na, unlikely to be SIADH.
   .
   # Transaminitis with elevated AST, ALT:  Resolving.  She underwent an
   abdominal ultrasound which revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC
   likely representing increased right heart pressure. AAA was noted at
   4.8 x 4.7 cm. Her crestor was held.
   .
   #.  Spiculated 1.8 cm lung mass in the right apical segment concerning
   for malignancy:
   - This will need a biopsy and further workup once acute issues have
   resolved.
   - Will notify pt and family once patient stabilized and out of the ICU
       .
   FEN:  Diabetic, heart healthy, low sodium diet. No IV fluids. Replete
   lytes PRN.
   .
   ACCESS: L IJ, may be pulled once pt stable after extubation.  PIV in
   place.
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip
   -Pain management with
   -Bowel regimen with  Miralax
   - GI PPx for high dose steroid use
   .
   CODE: DNR, confirmed with HCP at OSH. Patient already intubated. Okay
   with central lines and pressors.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and known abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).

The patient's current condition is critical, with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and is at risk of developing various medical complications. The potential complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary edema: Given the patient's history of chronic heart failure and recent worsening of systolic function, there is a risk of developing pulmonary edema, which can worsen respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's increased white blood cell count and the presence of bacteria in the sputum sample suggest a risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the use of amiodarone may increase the risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, which can worsen cardiac function.
4. Stroke: The patient's history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and the presence of atrial fibrillation increase the risk of developing a stroke.
5. Infection: The patient's respiratory failure and the presence of bacteria in the sputum sample suggest a risk of developing a respiratory infection, which can worsen respiratory failure.
6. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and the presence of a known AAA increase the risk of bleeding, which can worsen respiratory failure.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may be related to the presence of a new lung nodule, which could be a sign of malignancy, or it could be due to SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion).
8. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated AST and ALT levels may be related to the presence of liver disease, which can worsen respiratory failure.

To mitigate these risks, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, and metabolic status. The patient's medical team should also consider performing further diagnostic tests, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to better understand the underlying causes of her respiratory failure and to identify any potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical condition. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is currently present. The patient's cardiac function is impaired, with a chronic systolic heart failure diagnosis. The patient also has respiratory failure, which is acute but not acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient has a severe hyperglycemia, with a blood glucose level of 246 mg/dL. The patient's skin integrity is impaired, with no assessment performed.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.9, hemoglobin of 12.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 114. The patient's creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dL, and troponin-T level is 0.01 ng/mL. The patient's other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient has a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate) and is not expected to survive.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's respiratory failure and hyperglycemia make them susceptible to sepsis.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and impaired cardiac function increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen, requiring increased ventilatory support.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of skin breakdown and pressure ulcers.
5. Hyperglycemic crisis: The patient's severe hyperglycemia may worsen, requiring insulin therapy and close monitoring.
6. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and impaired cardiac function increase the risk of renal failure.
7. Infection: The patient's respiratory failure and impaired immune function make them susceptible to infection.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, close monitoring and management are essential to prevent these potential complications and improve their outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CHF with an EF of 30%, COPD, known AAA who
   presented to OSH with hypoxia and reduced EF, now extubated.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Differential includes COPD exacerbation,
   community acquired pneumonia, vs. pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia
   or HTN. Patient currently appears euvolemic.  Lungs clear to
   auscultation bilaterally. CXR not grossly overloaded. Chem 7 appears to
   be contraction alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.
   -f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures (negative to date)
   -Continue nebs, solumedrol for presumed COPD exacerbation (Given IV
   solumedrol 80mg [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.)
   -Continue Azithromycin for 5 day course empiric atypical PNA given
   increased WBC count this AM; although no infiltrate on OSH chest CT,
   thick secretions yesterday.  Will stop ceftriaxone
   - Extubated yesterday
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p multiple MIs. We do not have
   these records in our system. Outpatient cardiologist at [**Hospital 9079**]
   clinic.  Ruled out for MI during this admission.
   -Continue ASA, statin, Lisinopril
   -Hold BB in the setting of recent hypotension
 will consider
   restarting in the future if BP stable
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has known systolic heart failure with baseline EF of
   30%. Most recent echo showed EF of 15-20%.  Unclear why she has
   worsening systolic function, but should have TTE as an outpatient once
   her acute issues have resolved. Ruled out for ischemia at OSH. Patient
   currently appears euvolemic on exam. Chem 7 suggests contraction
   alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.
   - Continue Lisinopril
   - Follow I/Os, with goal even
   - Continue home Digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM:  currently in atrial fibrillation, rate well controlled. Afib
   with RVR induced by levophed at OSH. As a result, patient was loaded
   with IV amiodarone. Most recent INR 1.4.
   - Adjust Heparin sliding scale per correct weight.
   -Continue to anticoagulate with Warfarin, recheck INR.  CHAD2 score is
   3
 6% annual stroke risk from age, chf, dm so benefits from continued
   anticoagulation
   - Initiate Diltiazem 30mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Neuro deficits by history, most likely TIA.
   - consider carotid dopplers, likely as outpatient.
   - full neuro exam when off sedation
   .
   # DM2: Unclear outpatient regimen. However with steroids, sugars have
   been elevated. Question of Lantus dose at OSH, currently adequate sugar
   control on SSI without need for long acting insulin.
   -Discontinue Glargine as pt not requiring, and not on Glargine at home
   - Continue SSI
   -qid fingersticks
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 130 prior to transfer, currently resolved. Appears
   euvolemic. Patient has new lung nodule, concerning for malignancy, but
   given resolution of hyponatremia, unlikely to be SIADH.
   .
   # Transaminitis with elevated AST, ALT:  Resolving.  She underwent an
   abdominal ultrasound which revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC
   likely representing increased right heart pressure. AAA was noted at
   4.8 x 4.7 cm. Her crestor was held.
   .
   #.  Spiculated 1.8 cm lung mass in the right apical segment concerning
   for malignancy:
   - This will need a biopsy and further workup once acute issues have
   resolved.
   - Will notify pt and family once patient stabilized and out of the ICU
       .
   FEN:  Diabetic, heart healthy, low sodium diet. No IV fluids. Replete
   lytes PRN.
   .
   ACCESS: L IJ, may be pulled once pt stable after extubation.  PIV in
   place.
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip
   -Pain management
   -Bowel regimen with  Miralax
   - GI PPx for high dose steroid use
   .
   CODE: DNR, confirmed with HCP at OSH. Patient already intubated. Okay
   with central lines and pressors.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CHF with an EF of 30%, COPD, known AAA who
   presented to OSH with hypoxia and reduced EF, now extubated.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Differential includes COPD exacerbation,
   community acquired pneumonia, vs. pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia
   or HTN. Patient currently appears euvolemic.  Lungs clear to
   auscultation bilaterally. CXR not grossly overloaded. Chem 7 appears to
   be contraction alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.
   -f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures (negative to date)
   -Continue nebs, solumedrol for presumed COPD exacerbation (Given IV
   solumedrol 80mg [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.)
   -Continue Azithromycin for 5 day course empiric atypical PNA given
   increased WBC count this AM; although no infiltrate on OSH chest CT,
   thick secretions yesterday.  Will stop ceftriaxone
   - Extubated yesterday
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p multiple MIs. We do not have
   these records in our system. Outpatient cardiologist at [**Hospital 9079**]
   clinic.  Ruled out for MI during this admission.
   -Continue ASA, statin, Lisinopril
   -Hold BB in the setting of recent hypotension
 will consider
   restarting in the future if BP stable
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has known systolic heart failure with baseline EF of
   30%. Most recent echo showed EF of 15-20%.  Unclear why she has
   worsening systolic function, but should have TTE as an outpatient once
   her acute issues have resolved. Ruled out for ischemia at OSH. Patient
   currently appears euvolemic on exam. Chem 7 suggests contraction
   alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.
   - Continue Lisinopril
   - Follow I/Os, with goal even
   - Continue home Digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM:  currently in atrial fibrillation, rate well controlled. Afib
   with RVR induced by levophed at OSH. As a result, patient was loaded
   with IV amiodarone. Most recent INR 1.4.
   - Adjust Heparin sliding scale per correct weight.
   -Continue to anticoagulate with Warfarin, recheck INR.  CHAD2 score is
   3
 6% annual stroke risk from age, chf, dm so benefits from continued
   anticoagulation
   - Initiate Diltiazem 30mg [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Neuro deficits by history, most likely TIA.
   - consider carotid dopplers, likely as outpatient.
   - full neuro exam when off sedation
   .
   # DM2: Unclear outpatient regimen. However with steroids, sugars have
   been elevated. Question of Lantus dose at OSH, currently adequate sugar
   control on SSI without need for long acting insulin.
   -Discontinue Glargine as pt not requiring, and not on Glargine at home
   - Continue SSI
   -qid fingersticks
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 130 prior to transfer, currently resolved. Appears
   euvolemic. Patient has new lung nodule, concerning for malignancy, but
   given resolution of hyponatremia, unlikely to be SIADH.
   .
   # Transaminitis with elevated AST, ALT:  Resolving.  She underwent an
   abdominal ultrasound which revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC
   likely representing increased right heart pressure. AAA was noted at
   4.8 x 4.7 cm. Her crestor was held.
   .
   #.  Spiculated 1.8 cm lung mass in the right apical segment concerning
   for malignancy:
   - This will need a biopsy and further workup once acute issues have
   resolved.
   - Will notify pt and family once patient stabilized and out of the ICU
       .
   FEN:  Diabetic, heart healthy, low sodium diet. No IV fluids. Replete

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and known abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypoxia and reduced EF. She has been extubated and is currently on oxygen therapy. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. She also has impaired skin integrity and hyperglycemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to COPD exacerbation, community-acquired pneumonia, or pulmonary edema secondary to ischemia or hypertension. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is well-controlled, but she is at risk for stroke due to her age, CHF, and diabetes. Anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended.
3. Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure is chronic, but her systolic function is worsening. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of her worsening systolic function.
4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity is likely due to her chronic heart failure and respiratory failure. Further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of her skin integrity issues.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is likely due to her diabetes and the use of steroids. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of her hyperglycemia.
6. Lung Nodule: The patient has a new lung nodule that is concerning for malignancy. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the nodule.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia has resolved, but further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of her hyponatremia.
8. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis is likely due to her liver function tests (LFTs) and the use of steroids. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of her transaminitis.
9. Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: The patient has a known abdominal aortic aneurysm that is 4.8 x 4.7 cm. Further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of her aneurysm and the need for surgical intervention.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires further evaluation and management to determine the underlying causes of her respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, impaired skin integrity, hyperglycemia, lung nodule, hyponatremia, transaminitis, and abdominal aortic aneurysm."

   Assessment and Plan
   78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CHF with an EF of 30%, COPD, known AAA who
   presented to OSH with hypoxia and reduced EF, now extubated breathing
   well on 3L NC.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Differential includes COPD exacerbation,
   community acquired pneumonia, vs. pulmonary edema secondary to HTN.
   Ruled out for ischemia.  Patient currently appears euvolemic, CXR not
   grossly overloaded.  Rales on LLL possibly [**3-8**] fluid overload.
   Respiratory culture [**11-1**] grew out rare yeast, gram stain >25 PMN but no
   bacteria. Still with leukocytosis 12.1.  Ucx negative.  Chem 7 appears
   to be contraction alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.  Extubated
   yesterday, breathing well on 3L NC.
   - Continue Azithromycin for 5 day course for COPD flare
   - Taper steroids
   - Continue nebs
   - f/u blood cultures (negative to date)
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p multiple MIs. We do not have
   these records in our system. Outpatient cardiologist at [**Hospital 9079**]
   clinic.  Ruled out for MI during this admission.  Re-initiated on BB
   yesterday at home dose.
   -Continue ASA, statin, Lisinopril
   -Continue Metoprolol, uptitrate as needed to optimize HR control
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has known chronic systolic heart failure with baseline
   EF of 30%. Most recent echo showed EF of 15-20%.  Unclear why she has
   worsening systolic function, but should have TTE as an outpatient once
   her acute issues have resolved. Ruled out for ischemia at OSH. Patient
   currently appears euvolemic on exam. Chem 7 suggests contraction
   alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time unless patient becomes
   dyspneic or hypoxic.  Postive ~0.3 over 24 hours, initiated on 20mg po
   Lasix to start this morning.  Will monitor I/O today and diurese with
   additional Lasix to keep even if necessary.
   - Continue Lasix 20mg po daily
   - Lasix IV as needed to keep I/O even
   - Continue Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Currently in atrial fibrillation, rate well controlled. Afib
   with RVR induced by levophed at OSH. As a result, patient was loaded
   with IV Amiodarone. Most recent INR 1.4.   Initiated on Metoprolol at
   12.5mg daily (home dose) yesterday for tachycardia in 100
s.  Currently
   with HR 80
s with Metoprolol with SBP high 80
s, will transition to
   long acting Metoprolol today.  Will increase Diltiazem as needed for
   rate control to avoid risk of bronchospasm in pt with COPD.  PTT 150 on
   Heparin sliding scale.
   - Change Metoprolol to Metoprolol XR at same dose of 12.5 mg daily
   - Continue Diltiazem 30mg qid, increase as needed for rate control
   - Continue Coumadin, as INR 1.4, slowly increasing following
   administration of Vitamin K at OSH.  CHAD2 score is 3
 6% annual
   stroke risk from age, CHF, DM so benefits from continued
   anticoagulation
   .
 Neuro deficits by history, most likely TIA, no residual deficits.
   - Consider carotid dopplers, likely as outpatient.
   - full neuro exam when off sedation
   .
 DM2: Unclear outpatient regimen. However with steroids, sugars have
   been elevated. Question of Lantus dose at OSH, currently adequate sugar
   control on SSI without need for long acting insulin, will hold
   initiating Glargine if possible.
   - Continue SSI, adjust as needed
   - qid fingersticks
   .
 Hyponatremia: Na 130 prior to transfer, currently resolved. Appears
   euvolemic. Patient has new lung nodule, concerning for malignancy, but
   given resolution of hyponatremia, unlikely to be SIADH.
   .
 Transaminitis with elevated AST, ALT:  Resolving.  She underwent an
   abdominal ultrasound which revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC
   likely representing increased right heart pressure. AAA was noted at
   4.8 x 4.7 cm. Her crestor was held.
   .
 Spiculated 1.8 cm lung mass in the right apical segment concerning
   for malignancy:  In-house radiology will re-read CT images to confirm
   mass consistent with malignancy.  Patient notified this morning.
   - Obtain OSH imaging and f/u in-house read
   - Consult pulm pending in-house radiology read of CT; biopsy and
   further workup once acute issues have resolved.
       .
   FEN:  Diabetic, heart healthy, low sodium diet. No IV fluids. Replete
   lytes PRN.
   .
   ACCESS: L IJ, may be pulled once pt stable after extubation.  PIV in
   place.
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip
   -Pain management
   -Bowel regimen with Miralax
   - GI PPx for high dose steroid use
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CHF with an EF of 30%, COPD, known AAA who
   presented to OSH with hypoxia and reduced EF, now extubated breathing
   well on 3L NC.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Differential includes COPD exacerbation,
   community acquired pneumonia, vs. pulmonary edema secondary to HTN.
   Ruled out for ischemia.  Patient currently appears euvolemic, CXR not
   grossly overloaded.  Rales on LLL possibly [**3-8**] fluid overload.
   Respiratory culture [**11-1**] grew out rare yeast, gram stain >25 PMN but no
   bacteria. Still with leukocytosis 12.1.  Ucx negative.  Chem 7 appears
   to be contraction alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.  Extubated
   yesterday, breathing well on 3L NC.
   - Continue Azithromycin for 5 day course for COPD flare
   - Taper steroids
   - Continue nebs
   - f/u blood cultures (negative to date)
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p multiple MIs. We do not have
   these records in our system. Outpatient cardiologist at [**Hospital 9079**]
   clinic.  Ruled out for MI during this admission.  Re-initiated on BB
   yesterday at home dose.
   -Continue ASA, statin, Lisinopril
   -Continue Metoprolol, uptitrate as needed to optimize HR control
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has known chronic systolic heart failure with baseline
   EF of 30%. Most recent echo showed EF of 15-20%.  Unclear why she has
   worsening systolic function, but should have TTE as an outpatient once
   her acute issues have resolved. Ruled out for ischemia at OSH. Patient
   currently appears euvolemic on exam. Chem 7 suggests contraction
   alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time unless patient becomes
   dyspneic or hypoxic.  Postive ~0.3 over 24 hours, initiated on 20mg po
   Lasix to start this morning.  Will monitor I/O today and diurese with
   additional Lasix to keep even if necessary.
   - Continue Lasix 20mg po daily
   - Lasix IV as needed to keep I/O even
   - Continue Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Currently in atrial fibrillation, rate well controlled. Afib
   with RVR induced by levophed at OSH. As a result, patient was loaded
   with IV Amiodarone. Most recent INR 1.4.   Initiated on Metoprolol at
   12.5mg daily (home dose) yesterday for tachycardia in 100
s.  Currently
   with HR 80
s with Metoprolol with SBP high 80
s, will transition to
   long acting Metoprolol today.  Will increase Diltiazem as needed for
   rate control to avoid risk of bronchospasm in pt with COPD.  PTT 150 on
   Heparin sliding scale.
   - Change Metoprolol to Metoprolol XR at same dose of 12.5 mg daily
   - Continue Diltiazem 30mg qid, increase as needed for rate control
   - Continue Coumadin, as INR 1.4, slowly increasing following
   administration of Vitamin K at OSH.  CHAD2 score is 3
 6% annual
   stroke risk from age, CHF, DM so benefits from continued
   anticoagulation
   .
 Neuro deficits by history, most likely TIA, no residual deficits.
   - Consider carotid dopplers, likely as outpatient.
   - full neuro exam when off sedation
   .
 DM2: Unclear outpatient regimen. However with steroids, sugars have
   been elevated. Question of Lantus dose at OSH, currently adequate sugar
   control on SSI without need for long acting insulin, will hold
   initiating Glargine if possible.
   - Continue SSI, adjust as needed
   - qid fingersticks
   .
 Hyponatremia: Na 130 prior to transfer, currently resolved. Appears
   euvolemic. Patient has new lung nodule, concerning for malignancy, but
   given resolution of hyponatremia, unlikely to be SIADH.
   .
 Transaminitis with elevated AST, ALT:  Resolving.  She underwent an
   abdominal ultrasound which revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC
   likely representing increased right heart pressure. AAA was noted at
   4.8 x 4.7 cm. Her crestor was held.
   .
 Spiculated 1.8 cm lung mass in the right apical segment concerning
   for malignancy:  In-house radiology will re-read CT images to confirm
   mass consistent with malignancy.  Patient notified this morning.
   - Obtain OSH imaging and f/u in-house read
   - Consult pulm pending in-house radiology read of CT; biopsy and
   further workup once acute issues have resolved.
       .
   FEN:  Diabetic, heart healthy, low sodium diet. No IV fluids. Replete
   lytes PRN.
   .
   ACCESS: L IJ, may be pulled once pt stable after extubation.  PIV in
   place.
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip
   -Pain management
   -Bowel regimen with Miralax
   - GI PPx for high dose steroid use
   .
   CODE: DNR, confirmed with HCP at OSH. Patient already intubated. Okay
   with central lines and pressors.

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypoxia and reduced EF. She has been extubated and is breathing well on 3L nasal cannula oxygen. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and has had multiple myocardial infarctions (MIs). She has also had a recent abdominal ultrasound that revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC, likely due to increased right heart pressure.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98°F)
* Heart rate: 96 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 108/59 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 inspirations per minute (ipm)
* SpO2: 99%
* Hemoglobin: 13.2 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 12.1 K/uL
* Platelet count: 116 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.01 ng/mL
* Electrolytes: Na 130 mmol/L, K 4.2 mmol/L, Cl 97 mmol/L, HCO3 26 mmol/L

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to COPD exacerbation, community-acquired pneumonia, or pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension. She has also been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and has been treated with amiodarone. The patient's condition is considered stable, but she requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to respiratory arrest or failure to wean from mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart block, or cardiac arrest. Her history of CAD and MIs increases her risk of cardiac complications.
3. Infection: The patient's respiratory culture grew out a rare yeast, and she has a history of diabetes and COPD, which increases her risk of infection.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of diabetes and use of steroids can lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of TIA and recent abdominal ultrasound findings suggest a potential risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.
6. Endocrine complications: The patient's history of diabetes and use of steroids can lead to endocrine complications, such as hyperglycemia or adrenal insufficiency.
7. Renal complications: The patient's history of hypertension and use of diuretics can lead to renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.

The patient's code status is DNR, and she has a healthcare proxy who has been notified of her condition. The patient's disposition is currently CCU, and she will require close monitoring and management to prevent complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CHF with an EF of 30%, COPD, known AAA who
   presented to OSH with hypoxia and reduced EF, now extubated breathing
   well on 3L NC.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Differential includes COPD exacerbation,
   community acquired pneumonia, vs. pulmonary edema secondary to HTN.
   Ruled out for ischemia.  Patient currently appears euvolemic, CXR not
   grossly overloaded.  Rales on LLL possibly [**3-8**] fluid overload.
   Respiratory culture [**11-1**] grew out rare yeast, gram stain >25 PMN but no
   bacteria. Still with leukocytosis 12.1.  Ucx negative.  Chem 7 appears
   to be contraction alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.  Extubated
   yesterday, breathing well on 3L NC.
   - Continue Azithromycin for 5 day course for COPD flare
   - Taper steroids
   - Continue nebs
   - f/u blood cultures (negative to date)
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p multiple MIs. We do not have
   these records in our system. Outpatient cardiologist at [**Hospital 9079**]
   clinic.  Ruled out for MI during this admission.  Re-initiated on BB
   yesterday at home dose.
   -Continue ASA, statin, Lisinopril
   -Continue Metoprolol, uptitrate as needed to optimize HR control
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has known systolic heart failure with baseline EF of
   30%. Most recent echo showed EF of 15-20%.  Unclear why she has
   worsening systolic function, but should have TTE as an outpatient once
   her acute issues have resolved. Ruled out for ischemia at OSH. Patient
   currently appears euvolemic on exam. Chem 7 suggests contraction
   alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time unless patient becomes
   dyspneic or hypoxic.  Postive ~0.3 over 24 hours, initiated on 20mg po
   Lasix to start this morning.  Will monitor I/O today and diurese with
   additional Lasix to keep even if necessary.
   - Continue Lasix 20mg po daily
   - Lasix IV as needed to keep I/O even
   - Continue Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM:  currently in atrial fibrillation, rate well controlled. Afib
   with RVR induced by levophed at OSH. As a result, patient was loaded
   with IV Amiodarone. Most recent INR 1.4.   Initiated on Metoprolol at
   12.5mg daily (home dose) yesterday for tachycardia in 100
s.  Currently
   with HR 80
s with Metoprolol with SBP high 80
s, will transition to
   long acting Metoprolol today.  PTT 150 on Heparin sliding scale.
   - Change Metoprolol to Metoprolol XR at same dose of 12.5 mg daily
   - Continue Diltiazem 30mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue Coumadin, as INR 1.4, slowly increasing following
   administration of Vitamin K at OSH.  CHAD2 score is 3
 6% annual
   stroke risk from age, CHF, DM so benefits from continued
   anticoagulation
   .
   # Neuro deficits by history, most likely TIA, no residual deficits.
   - Consider carotid dopplers, likely as outpatient.
   - full neuro exam when off sedation
   .
   # DM2: Unclear outpatient regimen. However with steroids, sugars have
   been elevated. Question of Lantus dose at OSH, currently adequate sugar
   control on SSI without need for long acting insulin.
   - Discontinue Glargine as pt not requiring, and not on Glargine at home
   - Continue SSI
   -qid fingersticks
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 130 prior to transfer, currently resolved. Appears
   euvolemic. Patient has new lung nodule, concerning for malignancy, but
   given resolution of hyponatremia, unlikely to be SIADH.
   .
   # Transaminitis with elevated AST, ALT:  Resolving.  She underwent an
   abdominal ultrasound which revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC
   likely representing increased right heart pressure. AAA was noted at
   4.8 x 4.7 cm. Her crestor was held.
   .
   #.  Spiculated 1.8 cm lung mass in the right apical segment concerning
   for malignancy:
   - This will need a biopsy and further workup once acute issues have
   resolved.
   - Will notify pt and family once patient stabilized and out of the ICU
       .
   FEN:  Diabetic, heart healthy, low sodium diet. No IV fluids. Replete
   lytes PRN.
   .
   ACCESS: L IJ, may be pulled once pt stable after extubation.  PIV in
   place.
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip
   -Pain management
   -Bowel regimen with  Miralax
   - GI PPx for high dose steroid use

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, chronic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia and reduced ejection fraction.

The patient was extubated yesterday and is currently breathing well on 3L nasal cannula oxygen. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 96 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 108/59 mmHg.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation, community-acquired pneumonia, and pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension. The patient's chest x-ray is not grossly overloaded, but there are rales on the left lower lobe, which may indicate fluid overload.
2. Coronary artery disease: The patient has known coronary artery disease with a history of multiple myocardial infarctions. She was ruled out for myocardial infarction during this admission.
3. Heart failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with a baseline ejection fraction of 30%. Her most recent echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 15-20%. The patient is currently euvolemic, but her chem 7 suggests contraction alkalosis. She was initiated on 20mg of oral Lasix daily and will be monitored for fluid balance.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, which is well-controlled. She was loaded with IV amiodarone and initiated on metoprolol at 12.5mg daily.
5. Neurological deficits: The patient has a history of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and is at risk for stroke. She was ruled out for ischemia during this admission.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level was 130 prior to transfer, but it has since resolved. She has a new lung nodule that is concerning for malignancy.
7. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated AST and ALT levels, which are resolving. She underwent an abdominal ultrasound that revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC, likely representing increased right heart pressure.
8. Lung mass: The patient has a spiculated 1.8 cm lung mass in the right apical segment that is concerning for malignancy.

The patient's medications include:

* Azithromycin for 5 days for COPD flare
* Tapering steroids
* Nebulizers
* Furosemide 20mg daily
* Lisinopril
* Metoprolol XR 12.5mg daily
* Diltiazem 30mg daily
* Coumadin
* SSI insulin

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing Azithromycin for 5 days
* Tapering steroids
* Continuing nebs
* Furosemide 20mg daily
* Monitoring for fluid balance
* Considering carotid dopplers as an outpatient
* Full neuro exam when off sedation

   Assessment and Plan
   78-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin,
   diabetes, hyperlipidemia, CHF with an EF of 30%, COPD, known AAA who
   presented to OSH with hypoxia and reduced EF, now extubated breathing
   well.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Differential includes COPD exacerbation,
   community acquired pneumonia, vs. pulmonary edema secondary to HTN.
   Ruled out for ischemia.  Patient currently appears euvolemic, CXR not
   grossly overloaded.  Rales on LLL possibly [**3-8**] PNA, as respiratory
   culture [**11-1**] grew out rare yeast, gram stain >25 PMN but no bacteria.
   Still with leukocytosis 12.1.  Ucx negative.  Chem 7 appears to be
   contraction alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time.  Extubated
   yesterday, breathing well on 3L NC.
   - Continue Azithromycin for 5 day course empiric atypical PNA given
   increased WBC count this AM; although no infiltrate on OSH chest CT,
   thick secretions yesterday.
   - f/u blood cultures (negative to date)
   - Continue nebs, solumedrol for presumed COPD exacerbation (Given IV
   solumedrol 80mg [**Hospital1 **] at OSH.)
   .
   # CORONARIES:  Patient has known CAD s/p multiple MIs. We do not have
   these records in our system. Outpatient cardiologist at [**Hospital 9079**]
   clinic.  Ruled out for MI during this admission.  Re-initiated on BB
   yesterday at home dose.
   -Continue ASA, statin, Lisinopril
   -Continue Metoprolol, uptitrate as needed to optimize HR control
   .
   # PUMP:  Patient has known systolic heart failure with baseline EF of
   30%. Most recent echo showed EF of 15-20%.  Unclear why she has
   worsening systolic function, but should have TTE as an outpatient once
   her acute issues have resolved. Ruled out for ischemia at OSH. Patient
   currently appears euvolemic on exam. Chem 7 suggests contraction
   alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time unless patient becomes
   dyspneic or hypoxic.  Postive ~0.3 over 24 hours, initiated on 20mg po
   Lasix to start this morning.  Will monitor I/O today and diurese with
   additional Lasix to keep even.
   - Continue Lasix 20mg po daily
   - Lasix 20mg IV as needed to keep I/O even
   - Continue Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM:  currently in atrial fibrillation, rate well controlled. Afib
   with RVR induced by levophed at OSH. As a result, patient was loaded
   with IV Amiodarone. Most recent INR 1.4.   Initiated on Metoprolol at
   12.5mg daily (home dose) yesterday for tachycardia in 100
s.  Currently
   with continued HR 80
s-100
s, in need of up-titration of Metoprolol.
   PTT 150 on Heparin sliding scale.
   - Increase Metoprolol to 25mg daily
   - Continue Diltiazem 30mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider increasing Warfarin dose, as INR 1.4 four days after
   re-initiation.  CHAD2 score is 3
 6% annual stroke risk from age, chf,
   dm so benefits from continued anticoagulation
   .
   # Neuro deficits by history, most likely TIA.
   - consider carotid dopplers, likely as outpatient.
   - full neuro exam when off sedation
   .
   # DM2: Unclear outpatient regimen. However with steroids, sugars have
   been elevated. Question of Lantus dose at OSH, currently adequate sugar
   control on SSI without need for long acting insulin.
   - Discontinue Glargine as pt not requiring, and not on Glargine at home
   - Continue SSI
   -qid fingersticks
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 130 prior to transfer, currently resolved. Appears
   euvolemic. Patient has new lung nodule, concerning for malignancy, but
   given resolution of hyponatremia, unlikely to be SIADH.
   .
   # Transaminitis with elevated AST, ALT:  Resolving.  She underwent an
   abdominal ultrasound which revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC
   likely representing increased right heart pressure. AAA was noted at
   4.8 x 4.7 cm. Her crestor was held.
   .
   #.  Spiculated 1.8 cm lung mass in the right apical segment concerning
   for malignancy:
   - This will need a biopsy and further workup once acute issues have
   resolved.
   - Will notify pt and family once patient stabilized and out of the ICU
       .
   FEN:  Diabetic, heart healthy, low sodium diet. No IV fluids. Replete
   lytes PRN.
   .
   ACCESS: L IJ, may be pulled once pt stable after extubation.  PIV in
   place.
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip
   -Pain management
   -Bowel regimen with  Miralax
   - GI PPx for high dose steroid use
   .
   CODE: DNR, confirmed with HCP at OSH. Patient already intubated. Okay
   with central lines and pressors.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   30%. Most recent echo showed EF of 15-20%.  Unclear why she has
   worsening systolic function, but should have TTE as an outpatient once
   her acute issues have resolved. Ruled out for ischemia at OSH. Patient
   currently appears euvolemic on exam. Chem 7 suggests contraction
   alkalosis. Would not diurese at this time unless patient becomes
   dyspneic or hypoxic.  Postive ~0.3 over 24 hours, initiated on 20mg po
   Lasix to start this morning.  Will monitor I/O today and diurese with
   additional Lasix to keep even.
   - Continue Lasix 20mg po daily
   - Lasix 20mg IV as needed to keep I/O even
   - Continue Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Digoxin
   .
   # RHYTHM:  currently in atrial fibrillation, rate well controlled. Afib
   with RVR induced by levophed at OSH. As a result, patient was loaded
   with IV Amiodarone. Most recent INR 1.4.   Initiated on Metoprolol at
   12.5mg daily (home dose) yesterday for tachycardia in 100
s.  Currently
   with continued HR 80
s-100
s, in need of up-titration of Metoprolol.
   PTT 150 on Heparin sliding scale.
   - Increase Metoprolol to 25mg daily
   - Continue Diltiazem 30mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider increasing Warfarin dose, as INR 1.4 four days after
   re-initiation.  CHAD2 score is 3
 6% annual stroke risk from age, chf,
   dm so benefits from continued anticoagulation
   .
   # Neuro deficits by history, most likely TIA.
   - consider carotid dopplers, likely as outpatient.
   - full neuro exam when off sedation
   .
   # DM2: Unclear outpatient regimen. However with steroids, sugars have
   been elevated. Question of Lantus dose at OSH, currently adequate sugar
   control on SSI without need for long acting insulin.
   - Discontinue Glargine as pt not requiring, and not on Glargine at home
   - Continue SSI

   .
   # Hyponatremia: Na 130 prior to transfer, currently resolved. Appears
   euvolemic. Patient has new lung nodule, concerning for malignancy, but
   given resolution of hyponatremia, unlikely to be SIADH.
   .
   # Transaminitis with elevated AST, ALT:  Resolving.  She underwent an
   abdominal ultrasound which revealed dilated hepatic veins and IVC
   likely representing increased right heart pressure. AAA was noted at
   4.8 x 4.7 cm. Her crestor was held.
   .
   #.  Spiculated 1.8 cm lung mass in the right apical segment concerning
   for malignancy:
   - This will need a biopsy and further workup once acute issues have
   resolved.
   - Will notify pt and family once patient stabilized and out of the ICU
       .
   FEN:  Diabetic, heart healthy, low sodium diet. No IV fluids. Replete
   lytes PRN.
   .
   ACCESS: L IJ, may be pulled once pt stable after extubation.  PIV in
   place.
   .
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with heparin drip
   -Pain management
   -Bowel regimen with  Miralax
   - GI PPx for high dose steroid use
   .
   CODE: DNR, confirmed with HCP at OSH. Patient already intubated. Okay
   with central lines and pressors.

   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation, community-acquired pneumonia, and pulmonary edema secondary to hypertension. The patient's current respiratory status is stable, but further deterioration is possible.
2. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has known CAD with multiple MIs. The patient's current cardiac status is stable, but further cardiac events are possible.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic systolic heart failure with a baseline EF of 30%. The patient's current heart function is worsening, and further deterioration is possible.
4. Neurological Deficits: The patient has a history of TIA and is at risk for further neurological deficits.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels were previously low, but have since resolved. However, further hyponatremia is possible.
6. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated AST and ALT levels, which are resolving. Further liver damage is possible.
7. Lung Nodule: The patient has a new lung nodule, which is concerning for malignancy. Further workup is necessary to determine the cause and extent of the nodule.
8. Hyperglycemia: The patient has diabetes and has been experiencing hyperglycemia. Further hyperglycemia is possible if not managed properly.
9. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which is a risk factor for further skin breakdown and infection.
10. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is at risk for further sepsis if not managed properly.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, the following interventions are necessary:

1. Continue respiratory support and monitor for further respiratory deterioration.
2. Continue cardiac medications and monitor for further cardiac events.
3. Monitor the patient's neurological status and perform further workup for potential neurological deficits.
4. Monitor the patient's sodium levels and adjust hydration accordingly.
5. Continue liver function tests and monitor for further liver damage.
6. Perform further workup for the lung nodule and consider biopsy.
7. Manage hyperglycemia with insulin and monitor for further hyperglycemia.
8. Monitor the patient's skin integrity and perform further wound care as necessary.
9. Monitor the patient's temperature and blood pressure and adjust medication accordingly.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust treatment as necessary."
