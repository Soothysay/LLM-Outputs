You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient remains intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating between 60-80 mmHg, and their heart rate is within normal limits. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a SpO2 of 100% and a respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute. The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 9.4, hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, and a platelet count of 107. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating between 60-80 mmHg, which may indicate hypotension. This could be due to inadequate fluid resuscitation, cardiac dysfunction, or vasopressor medication.
2. Respiratory Compromise: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and their PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 186, which may indicate respiratory compromise. This could be due to inadequate ventilator settings, pneumonia, or lung injury.
3. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate sepsis. This could be due to a bacterial infection, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's lactate level is slightly elevated, which may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. This could be due to stress ulcer disease or gastrointestinal ischemia.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly low, which may indicate thrombocytopenia. This could be due to bone marrow suppression, sepsis, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but fluctuations in these levels could occur due to inadequate fluid resuscitation, diuretic therapy, or electrolyte imbalances.
7. Renal Compromise: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, which may indicate renal compromise. This could be due to inadequate fluid resuscitation, sepsis, or nephrotoxic medication.
8. Cardiac Compromise: The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, which may indicate cardiac compromise. This could be due to myocardial infarction, cardiac dysfunction, or cardiomyopathy."

   Assessment and Plan
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis.  No
   e/o malignancy at this point.  Patient started on heparin gtt.  Also
   with diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion.
   No e/o localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though
   s/p paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC).  Given compromised bowel
   wall, at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Vanc / Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Transition to Lovenox (30 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Pharmacy given decreased renal
   function; if improves increase to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **])
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Resend C.diff if new leukocytosis, febrile
    - GI recommendations
   - Started on Tube feeds overnight
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes
   in ventilator settings.  Following VBGs given too contracted for ABG.
   Family endorses heavy secretions at baseline.
     - Scopolamine patch (Cyproheptadine at home)
     - Goal fluid balance of even
     - VAP (Cefepime / Vanc) x 14 days total
     - Check NIF in AM (to assess for nueromuscular component)
     - Trial pressure support
   # Fever: Intermittent since admission on [**2-10**], [**2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**]
   ischemia; other possible sources of infection include pulmonary with
   some infiltrate on his CXR but he is without a leukocytosis.  Does have
   prominent secretions per primary Surgical team.
    - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP/VAP (14 days total)
    - Stop Tobramycin
    - Follow-up Micro
    - Culture if febrile
    - UA
   # Hypotension: Per family, patient's baseline BP high 70s - low 80s.
   Per nursing, also newly bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP 70s) overnight
   on [**2115-2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**] vagal tone with ET/CVL but also consider
   infectious process. Previously responded to Albumin and 500cc bolus
   LR.  Echo (final pending) Ef=55% and no focal wall motion
   abnormalities.
    - Monitor fluid balance
    - Goal SBP 80
   # SMV Occlusion: SMV occulsion with plan for 6 months anticoagulation
   per Vascular recommendation.  Started on Heparin gtt for
   anticoagulation PTT 60-80, as well as daily Coumadin with Goal INR
   [**1-16**].  Also noted to have diarrhea during stay (C.diff negative) thought
   to be lack of absorption due to bowel wall edema.
    - Per discussion with Vascular, no reason to not use Lovenox
    - Per discussion with pharmacy, will dose 30 mg SC BID (consider 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if Cr improves)
   # Anemia: Unclear source for acute on chronic anemia (baseline 35) but
   now on anticoagulation.  NG lavage / guaiac negative [**2115-2-20**].  Could
   consider some dilutional component, but likely does not explain
   complete loss
    - T&C x 2U PRBC
    - Monitor q8H Hct until stable
    - Continue to monitor stool guaiac
   # Renal insufficiency: Increased Cr to 0.7 from 0.4-0.5.  Could be [**1-15**]
   hypovolemia, infection (with Foley) vs medication reaction with AIN.
    - UA, Ulytes, UEos
   # Thrombocytopenia: New [**2-17**].  With prior hospitalization, could
   consider new exposure to heparin with HIT.  Other medications include
   antibiotics and Leviteracitam.
    - Stop heparin
    - Start Lovenox
    - Stop Keppra
   # Coagulopathy: Noted on admission; consider malnutrition vs
   malabsorption vs intrinsic liver disease.
    - Stop heparin, Coumadin
    - Start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hypoalbuminemia:  Noted on arrival, with similar etiology to
   coagulopathy.
    - Restart TF; support nutrition as able
    - Discuss trophic TF with Surgery
   # Cerebral Palsy: Not ambulatory at baseline; also with h/o chronic,
   intermittent diarrhea; chronic pancreatitis.  Could be an undiagnosed
   syndrome.
    - Seizure meds as below
    - Discuss with outpatient Neurology
    - Pancreatic enzymes as diet advances
   # Seizure disorder: Family describes them as 'drop seizures' with
   sudden head slumps.  On Dilantin / Phenobarbital as outpatient.
   Patient transitioned to Keppra while inpatient.
    - Discuss restarting Dilantin / Phenobarbital safely with pharmacy
    - Touch base with outpatient Neurology Openheimer ([**Hospital1 883**])

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the 24-hour events and progress note, the patient is a 6-year-old child with a complex medical history, including chronic pancreatitis, cerebral palsy, and a recent SMV thrombus with collaterals. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 71 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 70/48 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with a respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.4 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 107 x 10^9/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's medications include tobramycin, vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and dilantin. The patient is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin and Coumadin.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Abdominal pain: The patient has a finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals, which is likely due to chronic pancreatitis. The patient is at high risk for translocation of bacteria due to compromised bowel wall.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is being treated for HAP/VAP with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and tobramycin. The patient's lung infiltrate on CXR is persistent, and the patient is experiencing heavy secretions.
3. Fever: The patient has intermittent fever since admission, which could be due to ischemia, infection, or other sources.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which could be due to vagal tone, infectious process, or other factors.
5. SMV occlusion: The patient has a SMV occlusion, which requires anticoagulation therapy with heparin and Coumadin.
6. Anemia: The patient has acute on chronic anemia, which is unclear in its source.
7. Renal insufficiency: The patient has increased creatinine levels, which could be due to hypovolemia, infection, or medication reaction with acute interstitial nephritis.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has new thrombocytopenia, which could be due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or other medications.
9. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulopathy, which is unclear in its source.
10. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, which is likely due to malnutrition, malabsorption, or intrinsic liver disease.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue Vanc and Zosyn for HAP/VAP for 14 days total.
2. Follow-up cultures and check for new leukocytosis and fever.
3. Transition to Lovenox if the patient's renal function improves.
4. Monitor fluid balance and goal blood pressure.
5. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin and Coumadin.
6. Monitor stool guaiac and consider dilutional component in anemia.
7. Consider restarting dilantin and phenobarbital safely with pharmacy.
8. Discuss with outpatient neurology and consider pancreatic enzymes as diet advances.
9. Monitor for seizure disorder and consider restarting dilantin and phenobarbital.
10. Monitor for hypoglycemia and consider restarting TF.

The patient's code status is full code, and the patient's disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement."

    Assessment and Plan
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis.  No
   e/o malignancy at this point.  Patient started on heparin gtt.  Also
   with diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion.
   No e/o localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though
   s/p paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC).  Given compromised bowel
   wall, at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Vanc / Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Transition to Lovenox (30 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Pharmacy given decreased renal
   function; if improves increase to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **])
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Resend C.diff if new leukocytosis, febrile
    - GI recommendations
   - Started on Tube feeds overnight
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes
   in ventilator settings.  Following VBGs given too contracted for ABG.
   Family endorses heavy secretions at baseline.
     - Scopolamine patch (Cyproheptadine at home)
     - Goal fluid balance of even
     - VAP (Cefepime / Vanc) x 14 days total
     - Check NIF in AM (to assess for nueromuscular component)
     - Trial pressure support
   # Fever: Intermittent since admission on [**2-10**], [**2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**]
   ischemia; other possible sources of infection include pulmonary with
   some infiltrate on his CXR but he is without a leukocytosis.  Does have
   prominent secretions per primary Surgical team.
    - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP/VAP (14 days total)
    - Stop Tobramycin
    - Follow-up Micro
    - Culture if febrile
    - UA
   # Hypotension: Per family, patient's baseline BP high 70s - low 80s.
   Per nursing, also newly bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP 70s) overnight
   on [**2115-2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**] vagal tone with ET/CVL but also consider
   infectious process. Previously responded to Albumin and 500cc bolus
   LR.  Echo (final pending) Ef=55% and no focal wall motion
   abnormalities.
    - Monitor fluid balance
    - Goal SBP 80
   # SMV Occlusion: SMV occulsion with plan for 6 months anticoagulation
   per Vascular recommendation.  Started on Heparin gtt for
   anticoagulation PTT 60-80, as well as daily Coumadin with Goal INR
   [**1-16**].  Also noted to have diarrhea during stay (C.diff negative) thought
   to be lack of absorption due to bowel wall edema.
    - Per discussion with Vascular, no reason to not use Lovenox
    - Per discussion with pharmacy, will dose 30 mg SC BID (consider 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if Cr improves)
   # Anemia: Unclear source for acute on chronic anemia (baseline 35) but

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

    Assessment and Plan
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis.  No
   e/o malignancy at this point.  Patient started on heparin gtt.  Also
   with diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion.
   No e/o localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though
   s/p paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC).  Given compromised bowel
   wall, at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Vanc / Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Transition to Lovenox (30 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Pharmacy given decreased renal
   function; if improves increase to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **])
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Resend C.diff if new leukocytosis, febrile
    - GI recommendations
   - Started on Tube feeds overnight
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes
   in ventilator settings.  Following VBGs given too contracted for ABG.
   Family endorses heavy secretions at baseline.
     - Scopolamine patch (Cyproheptadine at home)
     - Goal fluid balance of even
     - VAP (Cefepime / Vanc) x 14 days total
     - Check NIF in AM (to assess for nueromuscular component)
     - Trial pressure support
   # Fever: Intermittent since admission on [**2-10**], [**2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**]
   ischemia; other possible sources of infection include pulmonary with
   some infiltrate on his CXR but he is without a leukocytosis.  Does have
   prominent secretions per primary Surgical team.
    - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for HAP/VAP (14 days total)
    - Stop Tobramycin
    - Follow-up Micro
    - Culture if febrile
    - UA
   # Hypotension: Per family, patient's baseline BP high 70s - low 80s.
   Per nursing, also newly bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP 70s) overnight
   on [**2115-2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**] vagal tone with ET/CVL but also consider
   infectious process. Previously responded to Albumin and 500cc bolus
   LR.  Echo (final pending) Ef=55% and no focal wall motion
   abnormalities.
    - Monitor fluid balance
    - Goal SBP 80
   # SMV Occlusion: SMV occulsion with plan for 6 months anticoagulation
   per Vascular recommendation.  Started on Heparin gtt for
   anticoagulation PTT 60-80, as well as daily Coumadin with Goal INR
   [**1-16**].  Also noted to have diarrhea during stay (C.diff negative) thought
   to be lack of absorption due to bowel wall edema.
    - Per discussion with Vascular, no reason to not use Lovenox
    - Per discussion with pharmacy, will dose 30 mg SC BID (consider 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if Cr improves)
   # Anemia: Unclear source for acute on chronic anemia (baseline 35) but
   now on anticoagulation.  NG lavage / guaiac negative [**2115-2-20**].  Could
   consider some dilutional component, but likely does not explain
   complete loss
    - T&C x 2U PRBC
    - Monitor q8H Hct until stable
    - Continue to monitor stool guaiac
   # Renal insufficiency: Increased Cr to 0.7 from 0.4-0.5.  Could be [**1-15**]
   hypovolemia, infection (with Foley) vs medication reaction with AIN.
    - UA, Ulytes, UEos
   # Thrombocytopenia: New [**2-17**].  With prior hospitalization, could
   consider new exposure to heparin with HIT.  Other medications include
   antibiotics and Leviteracitam.
    - Stop heparin
    - Start Lovenox
    - Stop Keppra
   # Coagulopathy: Noted on admission; consider malnutrition vs
   malabsorption vs intrinsic liver disease.
    - Stop heparin, Coumadin
    - Start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **]
   # Hypoalbuminemia:  Noted on arrival, with similar etiology to
   coagulopathy.
    - Restart TF; support nutrition as able
    - Discuss trophic TF with Surgery
   # Cerebral Palsy: Not ambulatory at baseline; also with h/o chronic,
   intermittent diarrhea; chronic pancreatitis.  Could be an undiagnosed
   syndrome.
    - Seizure meds as below
    - Discuss with outpatient Neurology
    - Pancreatic enzymes as diet advances
   # Seizure disorder: Family describes them as 'drop seizures' with
   sudden head slumps.  On Dilantin / Phenobarbital as outpatient.
   Patient transitioned to Keppra while inpatient.
    - Discuss restarting Dilantin / Phenobarbital safely with pharmacy
    - Touch base with outpatient Neurology Openheimer ([**Hospital1 883**])

Based on the 24-hour progress note, the patient remains intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a systolic blood pressure in the 60s-80s, heart rate of 71 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on 50% FiO2.

The patient's abdominal pain is managed with heparin gtt and antibiotics, and the patient is at high risk for translocation of bacteria due to compromised bowel wall. The patient is also at risk for bowel ischemia/congestion due to diffuse bowel edema.

The patient's respiratory failure is managed with Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin, and the patient has a persistent infiltrate on the CXR. The patient's fever is intermittent, and the patient may have a low-flow state in the setting of chronic pancreatitis.

The patient's hypotension is managed with fluid balance and goal SBP of 80, and the patient's renal insufficiency is managed with UA, Ulytes, and UEos.

The patient's thrombocytopenia is managed with stopping heparin and starting Lovenox, and the patient's coagulopathy is managed with stopping heparin and Coumadin and starting Lovenox.

The patient's hypoalbuminemia is managed with restarting TF and supporting nutrition as able, and the patient's cerebral palsy is managed with seizure meds and discussion with outpatient Neurology.

The patient's seizure disorder is managed with discussing restarting Dilantin/Phenobarbital safely with pharmacy and touching base with outpatient Neurology.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Sepsis due to bowel ischemia/congestion or translocation of bacteria
* Respiratory failure due to persistent infiltrate on CXR
* Renal failure due to decreased renal function
* Thrombotic complications due to anticoagulation therapy
* Bleeding complications due to coagulopathy
* Malnutrition due to bowel edema and compromised bowel wall
* Cerebral edema due to hypoalbuminemia
* Seizure activity due to anticonvulsant therapy

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing Vanc/Zosyn for HAP/VAP, stopping Tobramycin, and following up with cultures. The patient will also receive Lovenox for anticoagulation, and the patient's family will be educated on the importance of maintaining a euvolemic state."

    Assessment and Plan
   34M cerebral palsy initially p/w concern for abdominal infection now
   reintubated for respiratory failure.
   # Renal insufficiency: [**Last Name (un) 2406**] with Cr at 1.0 from baseline 0.3-0.4. Likely
   multifactorial with series of renal insults including hypovolemia
   followed by infection (with Foley) and then medications (including ABX)
   with possible AIN. CVP 10-15. Unwell week prior to admission, likely
   poor PO intake.
   - UA, Ulytes, UEos
   - holding vanc and tobra
   - consider renal consult
   - give another 500cc NS
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis. No
   e/o malignancy at this point. Patient started on heparin gtt. Also with
   diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion. No e/o
   localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though s/p
   paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC). Given compromised bowel wall,
   at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - D/C vanc given high levels
    - Continue Lovenox (30 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Pharmacy given decreased renal
   function; if improves increase to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **])
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Send repeat C.diff given fevers
   - GI recommendations
   - Hold tube feeds (started overnight) for extubation
   - Cont TPN across the day, order for tomorrow but hope to wean if can
   - Start pancreatic enzymes
   - f/u with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 10376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10339**] re: potential syndrome
   - check celiac disease labs
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes
   in ventilator settings.  Following VBGs given too contracted for ABG.
   Family endorses heavy secretions at baseline. NIF today showing
   significant component of NM contribution.
     - Scopolamine patch (Cyproheptadine at home)
     - Goal fluid balance of even
     - d/c vanc and tobra
     - continue Cefepime x 14 days total
     - Trial pressure support today and ? extubation
   # Fever: Intermittent since admission on [**2-10**], [**2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**]
   ischemia; other possible sources of infection include pulmonary with
   some infiltrate on his CXR but he is without a leukocytosis.  Does have
   prominent secretions per primary Surgical team.
    - Antibiotics as above (cont Zosyn, stopping Vanc and Tobra)
    - Follow-up Micro
    - Culture if febrile
    - UA
   # Hypotension: Per family, patient's baseline BP high 70s - low 80s.
   Per nursing, also newly bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP 70s) overnight
   on [**2115-2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**] vagal tone with ET/CVL but also consider
   infectious process. Previously responded to Albumin and 500cc bolus
   LR.  Echo (final pending) Ef=55% and no focal wall motion
   abnormalities.
    - Monitor fluid balance; goal even
    - Goal SBP 80, MAP ~60s
    - if bolus use 250-500cc
   # SMV Occlusion: SMV occulsion with plan for 6 months anticoagulation
   per Vascular recommendation.  Started on Heparin gtt for
   anticoagulation PTT 60-80, as well as daily Coumadin with Goal INR [**1-16**],
   now holding coumadin. Also noted to have diarrhea during stay (C.diff
   negative) thought to be lack of absorption due to bowel wall edema.
    - continue low dose Lovenox (discussed with vascular) at 30 qd
    - check Factor Xa level after 3^rd dose
    - Per discussion with pharmacy, will dose 30 mg SC BID (consider 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if Cr improves)
    - trend PLT (increased today, but some concern for HIT)
    - send HIT antibody
    - if tolerates tube feeds may restart Coumadin in next few days
   # Anemia: Unclear source for acute on chronic anemia (baseline 35) but
   now on anticoagulation. NG lavage / guaiac negative [**2115-2-20**]. Could
   consider some dilutional component, but likely does not explain
   complete loss. No blood yet given.
    - T&C x 2U PRBC; transfuse to 21 unless e/o ischemia/bleeding
    - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hct now that stable
    - Continue to monitor stool guaiac
   # Thrombocytopenia: New [**2-17**].  With prior hospitalization, could
   consider new exposure to heparin with HIT.  Other medications include
   antibiotics and Leviteracitam.
    - Stop heparin
    - Start Lovenox
    - Stop Keppra
    - check HIT antibodies as above
   # Coagulopathy: Noted on admission; consider malnutrition vs
   malabsorption vs intrinsic liver disease.
    - Stop heparin, Coumadin
    - Start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **] as above
   # Hypoalbuminemia:  Noted on arrival, with similar etiology to
   coagulopathy.
    - Restart TF; support nutrition as able
    - Discuss trophic TF with Surgery
   # Cerebral Palsy: Not ambulatory at baseline; also with h/o chronic,
   intermittent diarrhea; chronic pancreatitis. Could be an undiagnosed
   syndrome. Phenobarb level within therapeutic range on admission.
    - Seizure meds as below
    - Discuss with outpatient Neurology
    - Pancreatic enzymes as diet advances
    - check free dilantin level and free phenobarb levels
   # Seizure disorder: Family describes them as 'drop seizures' with
   sudden head slumps. On Dilantin / Phenobarbital as outpatient. Patient
   transitioned to Keppra while inpatient.
    - Discuss restarting Dilantin / Phenobarbital safely with pharmacy
    - Touch base with outpatient Neurology Openheimer ([**Hospital1 883**])
    - switch to phosphenitoin
   # FEN  Euvolemic to hypovolemic / replete PRN / continue TPN for now /
   start tube feeds later today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 34-year-old male with cerebral palsy who was initially admitted with concerns for abdominal infection and was reintubated for respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic pancreatitis, chronic diarrhea, and chronic malnutrition. He has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, tobramycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam, and has been receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and tube feeds. The patient has also been experiencing respiratory failure, hypotension, and fever, and has been treated with anticoagulation therapy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Renal insufficiency: The patient has a history of chronic pancreatitis, which may have contributed to his renal insufficiency. He is also receiving nephrotoxic antibiotics, which may further compromise his kidney function.
2. Abdominal pain: The patient has a history of chronic pancreatitis, which may have caused abdominal pain. He also has a finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals, which may be contributing to his abdominal pain.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, which may be related to his underlying chronic lung disease or to his recent hospitalization.
4. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be related to his underlying chronic illness or to his recent hospitalization.
5. Fever: The patient has been experiencing intermittent fever, which may be related to his underlying chronic illness or to his recent hospitalization.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient has a history of coagulopathy, which may be related to his underlying chronic illness or to his recent hospitalization.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has been experiencing thrombocytopenia, which may be related to his underlying chronic illness or to his recent hospitalization.
8. Anemia: The patient has been experiencing anemia, which may be related to his underlying chronic illness or to his recent hospitalization.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his antibiotic therapy as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's abdominal pain and consider further imaging studies to rule out other causes.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's hypotension and adjust his fluid therapy as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's fever and adjust his antibiotic therapy as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulopathy and adjust his anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and adjust his platelet transfusions as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust his transfusions as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   34M cerebral palsy initially p/w concern for abdominal infection now
   reintubated for respiratory failure.
   # Renal insufficiency: [**Last Name (un) 2406**] with Cr at 1.2 from baseline 0.3-0.4. Likely
   multifactorial with series of renal insults including hypovolemia
   followed by infection (with Foley) and then medications (including ABX)
   with possible AIN. CVP 10-15. Unwell week prior to admission, likely
   poor PO intake.
   -Urine lytes consistent w/ ATN
   - holding vanc and tobra
   - consider renal consult
   - give another 500cc NS
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis. No
   e/o malignancy at this point. Patient started on heparin gtt. Also with
   diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion. No e/o
   localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though s/p
   paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC). Given compromised bowel wall,
   at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - D/C vanc given high levels
    - Continue Lovenox (30 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Pharmacy given decreased renal
   function; if improves increase to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **])
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Send repeat C.diff given fevers
   - GI recommendations
   - Hold tube feeds (started overnight) for extubation
   - Cont TPN across the day, order for tomorrow but hope to wean if can
   - Start pancreatic enzymes
   - f/u with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 10376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10339**] re: potential syndrome
   - check celiac disease labs
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes
   in ventilator settings.  Following VBGs given too contracted for ABG.
   Family endorses heavy secretions at baseline. NIF today showing
   significant component of NM contribution.
     - Scopolamine patch (Cyproheptadine at home)
     - Goal fluid balance of even
     - d/c vanc and tobra
     - continue Cefepime x 14 days total
   # Fever: Intermittent since admission on [**2-10**], [**2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**]
   ischemia; other possible sources of infection include pulmonary with
   some infiltrate on his CXR but he is without a leukocytosis.  Does have
   prominent secretions per primary Surgical team.
    - Antibiotics as above (cont Zosyn, stopping Vanc and Tobra)
    - Follow-up Micro
    - Culture if febrile
    - UA
   # Hypotension: Per family, patient's baseline BP high 70s - low 80s.
   Per nursing, also newly bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP 70s) overnight
   on [**2115-2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**] vagal tone with ET/CVL but also consider
   infectious process. Previously responded to Albumin and 500cc bolus
   LR.  Echo (final pending) Ef=55% and no focal wall motion
   abnormalities.
    - Monitor fluid balance; goal even
    - Goal SBP 80, MAP ~60s
    - if bolus use 250-500cc
   # SMV Occlusion: SMV occulsion with plan for 6 months anticoagulation
   per Vascular recommendation.  Started on Heparin gtt for
   anticoagulation PTT 60-80, as well as daily Coumadin with Goal INR [**1-16**],
   now holding coumadin. Also noted to have diarrhea during stay (C.diff
   negative) thought to be lack of absorption due to bowel wall edema.
    - continue low dose Lovenox (discussed with vascular) at 30 qd
    - check Factor Xa level after 3^rd dose
    - Per discussion with pharmacy, will dose 30 mg SC BID (consider 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if Cr improves)
    - trend PLT (increased today, but some concern for HIT)
    - send HIT antibody
    - if tolerates tube feeds may restart Coumadin in next few days
   # Anemia: Unclear source for acute on chronic anemia (baseline 35) but
   now on anticoagulation. NG lavage / guaiac negative [**2115-2-20**]. Could
   consider some dilutional component, but likely does not explain
   complete loss. No blood yet given.
    - T&C x 2U PRBC; transfuse to 21 unless e/o ischemia/bleeding
    - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hct now that stable
    - Continue to monitor stool guaiac
   # Thrombocytopenia: New [**2-17**].  With prior hospitalization, could
   consider new exposure to heparin with HIT.  Other medications include
   antibiotics and Leviteracitam.
    - Stop heparin
    - Start Lovenox
    - Stop Keppra
    - check HIT antibodies as above
   # Coagulopathy: Noted on admission; consider malnutrition vs
   malabsorption vs intrinsic liver disease.
    - Stop heparin, Coumadin
    - Start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **] as above
   # Hypoalbuminemia:  Noted on arrival, with similar etiology to
   coagulopathy.
    - Restart TF; support nutrition as able
    - Discuss trophic TF with Surgery
   # Cerebral Palsy: Not ambulatory at baseline; also with h/o chronic,
   intermittent diarrhea; chronic pancreatitis. Could be an undiagnosed
   syndrome. Phenobarb level within therapeutic range on admission.
    - Seizure meds as below
    - Discuss with outpatient Neurology
    - Pancreatic enzymes as diet advances
    - check free dilantin level and free phenobarb levels
   # Seizure disorder: Family describes them as 'drop seizures' with
   sudden head slumps. On Dilantin / Phenobarbital as outpatient. Patient
   transitioned to Keppra while inpatient.
    - Discuss restarting Dilantin / Phenobarbital safely with pharmacy
    - Touch base with outpatient Neurology Openheimer ([**Hospital1 883**])

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   34M cerebral palsy initially p/w concern for abdominal infection now
   reintubated for respiratory failure.
   # Renal insufficiency: [**Last Name (un) 2406**] with Cr at 1.2 from baseline 0.3-0.4. Likely
   multifactorial with series of renal insults including hypovolemia
   followed by infection (with Foley) and then medications (including ABX)
   with possible AIN. CVP 10-15. Unwell week prior to admission, likely
   poor PO intake.
   -Urine lytes consistent w/ ATN
   - holding vanc and tobra
   - consider renal consult
   - give another 500cc NS
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis. No
   e/o malignancy at this point. Patient started on heparin gtt. Also with
   diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion. No e/o
   localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though s/p
   paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC). Given compromised bowel wall,
   at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - D/C vanc given high levels
    - Continue Lovenox (30 mg [**Hospital1 **] per Pharmacy given decreased renal
   function; if improves increase to 40 mg [**Hospital1 **])
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Send repeat C.diff given fevers
   - GI recommendations
   - Hold tube feeds (started overnight) for extubation
   - Cont TPN across the day, order for tomorrow but hope to wean if can
   - Start pancreatic enzymes
   - f/u with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 10376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10339**] re: potential syndrome
   - check celiac disease labs
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes
   in ventilator settings.  Following VBGs given too contracted for ABG.
   Family endorses heavy secretions at baseline. NIF today showing
   significant component of NM contribution.
     - Scopolamine patch (Cyproheptadine at home)
     - Goal fluid balance of even
     - d/c vanc and tobra
     - continue Cefepime x 14 days total
   # Fever: Intermittent since admission on [**2-10**], [**2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**]
   ischemia; other possible sources of infection include pulmonary with
   some infiltrate on his CXR but he is without a leukocytosis.  Does have
   prominent secretions per primary Surgical team.
    - Antibiotics as above (cont Zosyn, stopping Vanc and Tobra)
    - Follow-up Micro
    - Culture if febrile
    - UA
   # Hypotension: Per family, patient's baseline BP high 70s - low 80s.
   Per nursing, also newly bradycardic and hypotensive (SBP 70s) overnight
   on [**2115-2-19**].  Could be [**1-15**] vagal tone with ET/CVL but also consider
   infectious process. Previously responded to Albumin and 500cc bolus
   LR.  Echo (final pending) Ef=55% and no focal wall motion
   abnormalities.
    - Monitor fluid balance; goal even
    - Goal SBP 80, MAP ~60s
    - if bolus use 250-500cc
   # SMV Occlusion: SMV occulsion with plan for 6 months anticoagulation
   per Vascular recommendation.  Started on Heparin gtt for
   anticoagulation PTT 60-80, as well as daily Coumadin with Goal INR [**1-16**],
   now holding coumadin. Also noted to have diarrhea during stay (C.diff
   negative) thought to be lack of absorption due to bowel wall edema.
    - continue low dose Lovenox (discussed with vascular) at 30 qd
    - check Factor Xa level after 3^rd dose
    - Per discussion with pharmacy, will dose 30 mg SC BID (consider 40 mg
   [**Hospital1 **] if Cr improves)
    - trend PLT (increased today, but some concern for HIT)
    - send HIT antibody
    - if tolerates tube feeds may restart Coumadin in next few days
   # Anemia: Unclear source for acute on chronic anemia (baseline 35) but
   now on anticoagulation. NG lavage / guaiac negative [**2115-2-20**]. Could
   consider some dilutional component, but likely does not explain
   complete loss. No blood yet given.
    - T&C x 2U PRBC; transfuse to 21 unless e/o ischemia/bleeding
    - Monitor [**Hospital1 **] Hct now that stable
    - Continue to monitor stool guaiac
   # Thrombocytopenia: New [**2-17**].  With prior hospitalization, could
   consider new exposure to heparin with HIT.  Other medications include
   antibiotics and Leviteracitam.
    - Stop heparin
    - Start Lovenox
    - Stop Keppra
    - check HIT antibodies as above
   # Coagulopathy: Noted on admission; consider malnutrition vs
   malabsorption vs intrinsic liver disease.
    - Stop heparin, Coumadin
    - Start Lovenox [**Hospital1 **] as above
   # Hypoalbuminemia:  Noted on arrival, with similar etiology to
   coagulopathy.
    - Restart TF; support nutrition as able
    - Discuss trophic TF with Surgery
   # Cerebral Palsy: Not ambulatory at baseline; also with h/o chronic,
   intermittent diarrhea; chronic pancreatitis. Could be an undiagnosed
   syndrome. Phenobarb level within therapeutic range on admission.
    - Seizure meds as below
    - Discuss with outpatient Neurology
    - Pancreatic enzymes as diet advances
    - check free dilantin level and free phenobarb levels
   # Seizure disorder: Family describes them as 'drop seizures' with
   sudden head slumps. On Dilantin / Phenobarbital as outpatient. Patient
   transitioned to Keppra while inpatient.
    - Discuss restarting Dilantin / Phenobarbital safely with pharmacy
    - Touch base with outpatient Neurology Openheimer ([**Hospital1 883**])
    - switch to phosphenitoin
   # FEN  Euvolemic to hypovolemic / replete PRN / continue TPN for now /
   start tube feeds later today
   # PPX:
   - PPI
   - Chlorehexadine gluconate
   - Pneumoboots

Based on the 24-hour progress note, the patient is a 34-year-old male with cerebral palsy, who was reintubated for respiratory failure and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen therapy. The patient has several medical conditions, including renal insufficiency, abdominal pain, respiratory failure, fever, hypotension, SMV occlusion, anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and hypoalbuminemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 101/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's CVP is 10 mmHg, and the total fluid balance is -123 mL.

The patient has several lab results that are abnormal, including:

* Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL (baseline 0.3-0.4 mg/dL)
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 143 mg/dL
* Potassium: 5.4 mEq/L
* Phosphorus: 4.3 mEq/L
* Magnesium: 2.7 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.3 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.4 g/dL
* Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 162 IU/L
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* White blood cell count (WBC): 10.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 7.4 g/dL
* Platelet count (PLT): 110 x 10^9/L

The patient is receiving several medications, including:

* Fosphenytoin
* Pantoprazole
* Piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Tobramycin
* Vancomycin
* Heparin
* Lovenox
* Keppra
* Phosphenytoin

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and the patient is at risk for further renal damage due to the presence of SMV occlusion and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
* Abdominal infection: The patient has a SMV thrombus with collaterals, which may be causing abdominal pain and fever.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen therapy and has a history of respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient has a fever and is at risk for sepsis due to the presence of a central line and the use of antibiotics.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to the use of heparin or other medications.
* Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which may be due to malnutrition, malabsorption, or intrinsic liver disease.
* Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has a low albumin level, which may be due to malnutrition, malabsorption, or intrinsic liver disease.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy
* Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust the dose of medications accordingly
* Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust the dose of medications accordingly
* Continue to monitor the patient's temperature and adjust the dose of antipyretics accordingly
* Monitor the patient's fluid balance and adjust the dose of fluids accordingly
* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust the dose of oxygen therapy accordingly
* Consider the use of a renal consult to further evaluate the patient's renal function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided 24-hour progress note, the patient is a pediatric ICU patient who was extubated yesterday morning and is currently on humidified face mask and nasal cannula oxygen therapy at 3 L/min. The patient received two 500cc normal saline boluses during the day and has continued to receive total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and tube feedings (TFs).

The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 10 mmHg, and their fluid balance is negative 123 mL. Their vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 101/62 mmHg. Their respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and their oxygen saturation is 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show an increasing creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, with a urine output of 60-100 cc/hr. Their white blood cell count is 10.1 K/uL, and their platelet count is 110 K/uL. Their liver function tests (LFTs) are within normal limits, except for a mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase level of 77 U/L.

The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low calcium level of 8.3 mg/dL. Their blood glucose level is within normal limits, and their lactate level is 0.9 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications that may arise based on this information include:

1. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative, but their CVP is slightly elevated, which may indicate fluid overload.
2. Respiratory compromise: The patient is still on oxygen therapy, and their respiratory rate is slightly elevated. They may require further respiratory support.
3. Renal compromise: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, which may indicate renal compromise or injury.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is receiving tube feedings, and their liver function tests are within normal limits, but they may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as necrotizing enterocolitis.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's calcium level is slightly low, which may indicate an electrolyte imbalance.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is within normal limits, but they may be at risk for hypoglycemia due to their underlying medical condition and medication regimen.

Further monitoring and evaluation are necessary to address these potential complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   34M cerebral palsy initially p/w concern for abdominal infection now
   reintubated for respiratory failure.
   # Renal insufficiency: [**Last Name (un) 2406**] with Cr at 1.2 from baseline 0.3-0.4. Likely
   multifactorial with series of renal insults including hypovolemia
   followed by infection (with Foley) and then medications (including ABX)
   with possible ATN/AIN. CVP 10-15. Unwell week prior to admission,
   likely poor PO intake.
   -Urine lytes consistent w/ ATN
   - holding vanc and tobra
   - consider renal consult
   - give another 500cc NS
   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis. No
   e/o malignancy at this point. Patient started on heparin gtt. Also with
   diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion. No e/o
   localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though s/p
   paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC). Given compromised bowel wall,
   at high risk for translocation of bacteria.
    - Continue Zosyn (14 day total course)
    - D/C vanc given high levels
    - Continue Lovenox (30 mg QD per Pharmacy)
   -  Start on Coumadin 5mg PO tonight
    - Vascular recs / Surgery recs
    - Follow-up cultures
    - Send repeat C.diff given fevers
   - GI recommendations
   - Hold tube feeds (started overnight) for extubation
   - Cont TPN and tube feeds
 start weaning TPN once INR starts to
   elevate (would indicate gut absorption)
   - Continue pancreatic enzymes
   - f/u with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 10376**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10339**] re: potential syndrome
   - F/U celiac disease labs
   # Respiratory failure: Treating for HAP/VAP with
   Vanc/Zosyn/Tobramycin.  ID said no to Amikacin.  With LLL infiltrate on
   CXR (persistent) but new since admission.  Afebrile the night prior to
   transfer but with continued heavy secretions.  No appreciable changes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   reintubated for respiratory failure.
   # Renal insufficiency: [**Last Name (un) 2406**] with Cr at 1.2 from baseline 0.3-0.4. Likely
   multifactorial with series of renal insults including hypovolemia
   followed by infection (with Foley) and then medications (including ABX)
   with possible ATN/AIN. CVP 10-15. Unwell week prior to admission,
   likely poor PO intake.

   # Abdominal pain: Patient with finding of SMV thrombus with collaterals
   indicative of a chronic process.  Surgery and Vascular involved,
   suspect [**1-15**] to low flow state in setting of chronic pancreatitis. No
   e/o malignancy at this point. Patient started on heparin gtt. Also with
   diffuse bowel edema concerning for bowel ischemia / congestion. No e/o
   localized infection overlying inflammation at this point (though s/p
   paracentesis x 2, both with > 1000 WBC). Given compromised bowel wall,
   at high risk for translocation of bacteria.

Based on the 24-hour events, the patient's condition remains unstable with multiple comorbidities. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level has risen to 1.2, indicating renal insufficiency. The patient is at risk for further decline in renal function due to hypovolemia, infection, and medications.
2. Abdominal Pain: The patient has a SMV thrombus with collaterals, indicating a chronic process. The patient is at risk for bowel ischemia/congestion, and the compromised bowel wall increases the risk of translocation of bacteria.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is being treated for HAP/VAP, and the continued heavy secretions and LLL infiltrate on CXR indicate ongoing respiratory compromise.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is 149, indicating a free water deficit of approximately 1.3L. The patient is at risk for further electrolyte imbalance.
5. Fever: The patient has intermittent fever since admission, which could be due to ischemia, infection, or other sources.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has dropped, and the family reports a baseline blood pressure in the high 70s to low 80s. The patient is at risk for further hypotension due to underlying conditions.
7. SMV Occlusion: The patient has an SMV occlusion, which requires anticoagulation therapy. The patient is at risk for bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia is acute on chronic, and the source is unclear. The patient may require blood transfusions to correct the anemia.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has new thrombocytopenia, which may be due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The patient is at risk for bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia.
10. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, which may be due to malnutrition, malabsorption, or intrinsic liver disease. The patient is at risk for bleeding complications due to coagulopathy.
11. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has hypoalbuminemia, which may be due to malnutrition, malabsorption, or intrinsic liver disease. The patient is at risk for further complications due to hypoalbuminemia.

The patient's medical team should continue to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust therapy accordingly to address these potential complications."
