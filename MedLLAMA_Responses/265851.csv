   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: Mrs. [**Known lastname 7199**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with PMH of mesenteric
   ischemia and TIA a/w abdominal pain and hyponatremia transferred to
   MICU with with hypertensive emergency now resolved.
   #Hypertensive urgency/emergency: Pt with hypertensive urgency vs.
   emergency. Currently BP improved after receiving IV labetalol. Had HA
   and SBP>200 but resolved. Floor team was having difficulty achieving
   control (systolic > 210) despite metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 40mg
   daily, and amlodipine 10 in addition to standing hydralazine 25mg PO
   q6H with PRN 10mg IV. They also tried enalaprilat with no effect.
   However, upon transfer, pts SBPs 150s and has not required further
   expansion of antihypertensive regimen. Possibly was hypertensive from
   constipation and abdominal pain which is now improved.  CT and MRI
   showed no sign of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.
   - Will discontinue labetalol drip today given improvement to SBP down
   to 130
s to 150
s, goal should be around 150 systolic
   - Will restart oral regimen of Valsartan 80mg daily,
   hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO, metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 10mg
   QD
   - Will make hydralazine PRN, and will consider nitropaste for elevated
   pressures
   - F/U formal read of MRI
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Pt had
   increasing pulmonary edema (cephalization) on chest x-ray but oxygen
   requirement mildly improved from admission. Currently satting mid 90s
   on 2L, appears comfortable.
   - received Furosemide 40mg IV x 1 yesterday
   - will dose daily based on exam
   # Pneumonia - Pt with low grade fevers, productive cough, infiltrate on
   CXR and Moraxella in sputum cx. Continues to have productive cough.
   Oxygenation improved. CXR was clear on admission and on [**11-30**] so may
   have health care associated pneumonia but currently doing well.
   Completed azithromycin course, on day 5 of ceftriaxone, last day
   [**2172-12-10**].
   - Continue benzonatate and codeine for symptomatic relief of cough
   - Consulted physical therapy for chest physical therapy, appreciate
   assistance
   # Abdominal pain, nausea: Stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and
   normal lactate. Possibly represents intestinal angina vs. dyspepsia vs.
   gastritis.
   - Continue bowel regimen as this is likely related to constipation, if
   worsens consider KUB to rule out obstruction
   - Continue pantoprazole
   - Guaiac stools
   # Chronic renal failure (bl 1.4-1.6): Stable, continue to renally dose
   meds, continuing valsartan. Will closely follow renal function with
   increased dose valsartan.
   - at baseline. will follow
   # Anemia: Stable recently, iron deficiency?  Continue iron
   supplementation
   - continue to trend

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of mesenteric ischemia, TIA, and chronic renal failure. She was transferred to the MICU with a hypertensive emergency, which has since been resolved with IV labetalol. Her current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.9°C (100.2°F)
* Heart rate: 83 bpm
* Blood pressure: 150/41 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 97%

She has a history of pneumonia, abdominal pain, and chronic renal failure. She is currently receiving treatment for pneumonia with azithromycin and ceftriaxone, and her cough has improved. Her abdominal pain is stable, and a CTA showed no signs of ischemia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 5.4 K/uL
* Hct: 30.0%
* Plt: 376 K/uL
* Cr: 1.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 132 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Discontinuing labetalol drip and restarting oral antihypertensive medications
* Continuing treatment for pneumonia with azithromycin and ceftriaxone
* Managing abdominal pain with bowel regimen and pantoprazole
* Continuing treatment for chronic renal failure with valsartan
* Monitoring for anemia and iron deficiency
* Continuing treatment for TIA with aggrenox and simvastatin

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Hypertensive crisis or emergency due to inadequate blood pressure control
* Pneumonia complications such as respiratory failure or sepsis
* Abdominal pain complications such as intestinal obstruction or perforation
* Chronic renal failure complications such as acute kidney injury or uremia
* Anemia complications such as fatigue or weakness
* TIA complications such as stroke or transient ischemic attack

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: Mrs. [**Known lastname 7199**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with PMH of mesenteric
   ischemia and TIA a/w abdominal pain and hyponatremia transferred to
   MICU with with hypertensive emergency now resolved.
   #Hypertensive urgency/emergency: Pt with hypertensive urgency vs.
   emergency. Currently BP improved after receiving IV labetalol. Had HA
   and SBP>200 but resolved. Floor team was having difficulty achieving
   control (systolic > 210) despite metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 40mg
   daily, and amlodipine 10 in addition to standing hydralazine 25mg PO
   q6H with PRN 10mg IV. They also tried enalaprilat with no effect.
   However, upon transfer, pts SBPs 150s and has not required further
   expansion of antihypertensive regimen. Possibly was hypertensive from
   constipation and abdominal pain which is now improved.  CT and MRI
   showed no sign of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.
   - Will discontinue labetalol drip today given improvement to SBP down
   to 130
s to 150
s, goal should be around 150 systolic
   - Will restart oral regimen of Valsartan 80mg daily,
   hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO, metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 10mg
   QD
   - Will make hydralazine PRN, and will consider nitropaste for elevated
   pressures
   - F/U formal read of MRI
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Pt had
   increasing pulmonary edema (cephalization) on chest x-ray but oxygen
   requirement mildly improved from admission. Currently satting mid 90s
   on 2L, appears comfortable.
   - received Furosemide 40mg IV x 1 today
   - will dose daily based on exam
   # Pneumonia - Pt with low grade fevers, productive cough, infiltrate on
   CXR and Moraxella in sputum cx. Continues to have productive cough.
   Oxygenation marginally improved. CXR was clear on admission and on
   [**11-30**] so may have health care associated pneumonia but currently doing
   well on CTX/Azithro.
   - Continue empiric CAP coverage with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for
   10-day course. Sputum cx grew moraxella which would be covered by
   current regimen.  Azithromycin to finish on [**12-5**], ceftriaxone on
   [**2172-12-10**].
   - Continue benzonatate and codeine
   - Consulted physical therapy for chest physical therapy, appreciate
   assistance
   # Abdominal pain, nausea: Stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and
   normal lactate. Possibly represents intestinal angina vs. dyspepsia.
   Amylase and lipase reviously normal but can recheck in am
   - Continue to monitor, repeat lactate if needed
   - repeat amylase and lipase
   - Guaiac stools
   # Chronic renal failure (bl 1.4-1.6): Stable, renally dose meds,
   continuing valsartan. Will closely follow renal function with increased
   dose valsartan.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of mesenteric ischemia, TIA, and hypertension, who was transferred to the MICU with a hypertensive emergency. The patient's blood pressure has been better controlled since being started on Labetalol drip, ranging from 150/130 to 150/150 mmHg.

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

1. Hypertensive urgency/emergency: The patient's blood pressure was initially uncontrolled, but has since improved with Labetalol drip. The patient may have had a hypertensive emergency due to constipation and abdominal pain, which has now improved.
2. Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient has increasing pulmonary edema, but oxygen requirement has mildly improved.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has a low-grade fever, productive cough, and infiltrate on CXR, and has been empirically treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
4. Abdominal pain, nausea: The patient's abdominal pain has improved, but may still represent intestinal angina or dyspepsia.
5. Chronic renal failure: The patient has stable renal function, and is being closely monitored with increased dose of valsartan.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia has increased from yesterday, and will be closely followed.
7. FEN: The patient is receiving IV fluids and repleting electrolytes as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure may fluctuate and require further treatment.
2. Heart failure: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen, and further treatment may be necessary.
3. Pneumonia: The patient may develop a more severe form of pneumonia, and may require additional antibiotics or treatment.
4. Abdominal ischemia: The patient's abdominal pain may worsen, and may require further treatment or surgery.
5. Renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen, and may require further treatment or dialysis.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, and may require further treatment or transfusions.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, abdominal pain, and malignant hypertension. They are receiving labetalol for hypertension and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient is being monitored for fluid balance, hemodynamics, and respiratory support. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, and blood pressure of 165/41 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and face tent, with an SpO2 of 97%. The patient's lab results show mild anemia, mild thrombocytopenia, and normal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's community-acquired pneumonia increases the risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's malignant hypertension requires close monitoring to prevent further complications, such as hypertensive encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, or renal failure.
3. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness increase the risk of developing abdominal compartment syndrome, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
4. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing VTE, which can lead to pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and hypertension increase the risk of developing respiratory failure, which can lead to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia increase the risk of developing metabolic acidosis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
7. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and other comorbidities increase the risk of developing secondary infections, such as urinary tract infections or bloodstream infections."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname 7199**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with PMH of mesenteric
   ischemia and TIA a/w abdominal pain and hyponatremia transferred to
   MICU with with hypertensive emergency now resolved.
   #Hypertensive urgency/emergency: Pt with hypertensive urgency vs.
   emergency. Currently BP improved. Had HA and SBP>200 but these now
   resolved. Floor team having difficulty achieving control (systolic >
   210) despite metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 40mg daily, and amlodipine
   10 in addition to standing hydralazine 25mg PO q6H with PRN 10mg IV.
   They have also tried enalaprilat with no effect. However, upon
   transfer, pts SBPs 150s and has not required further expansion of
   antihypertensive regimen. Unclear when BP improved but has not required
   labetalol drip. Possibly was hypertensive from constipation and
   abdominal pain which is now improved. Stroke was also concern but would
   not expect spontaneous improvement
   - Furosemide 40mg IV and hydral IV prn
   - Continue Valsartan 80mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO,
   metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine
   - PRN hydralazine and will start labetalol drip if neccessary to
   maintain SBP<180
   - F/U read MRI
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Pt had
   increasing pulmonary edema (cephalization) on chest x-ray but oxygen
   requirement mildly improved from admission. Currently satting mid 90s
   on 2L, appears comfortable.
   - received Furosemide 40mg IV x 1 today
   - will dose daily based on exam
   # Pneumonia - Pt with low grade fevers, productive cough, infiltrate on
   CXR and Moraxella in sputum cx. Continues to have productive cough.
   Oxygenation marginally improved. CXR was clear on admission and on
   [**11-30**] so may have health care associated pneumonia but currently doing
   well on CTX/Azithro.
   - Continue empiric CAP coverage with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for
   10-day course. Sputum cx grew moraxella which would be covered by
   current regimen.  Azithromycin to finish on [**12-5**], ceftriaxone on
   [**2172-12-10**].
   - Continue benzonatate and codeine
   - Consulted physical therapy for chest physical therapy, appreciate
   assistance
   # Abdominal pain, nausea: Stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and
   normal lactate. Possibly represents intestinal angina vs. dyspepsia.
   Amylase and lipase reviously normal but can recheck in am
   - Continue to monitor, repeat lactate if needed
   - repeat amylase and lipase
   - Guaiac stools
   # Chronic renal failure (bl 1.4-1.6): Stable, renally dose meds,
   continuing valsartan. Will closely follow renal function with increased
   dose valsartan.
   - at baseline. will follow
   # Anemia: Stable recently. Increased from yesterday.
   - trend
   - guaiac stools
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / regular diet
   # PPX: PPI, heparin SQ, bowel regimen
   # ACCESS: PIV
   # CODE: DNR/DNI - on previous admissions, confirmed w/ Daughter [**Name (NI) 7200**]
   and grandchildren
   # CONTACT: Daughter [**Name2 (NI) **] [**0-0-**]

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: Mr. [**Known lastname 7199**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with PMH of mesenteric
   ischemia and TIA a/w abdominal pain and hyponatremia transferred to
   MICU with with hypertensive emergency now resolved.
   #Hypertensive urgency/emergency: Pt with hypertensive urgency vs.
   emergency. Currently BP improved. Had HA and SBP>200 but these now
   resolved. Floor team having difficulty achieving control (systolic >
   210) despite metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 40mg daily, and amlodipine
   10 in addition to standing hydralazine 25mg PO q6H with PRN 10mg IV.
   They have also tried enalaprilat with no effect. However, upon
   transfer, pts SBPs 150s and has not required further expansion of
   antihypertensive regimen. Unclear when BP improved but has not required
   labetalol drip. Possibly was hypertensive from constipation and
   abdominal pain which is now improved. Stroke was also concern but would
   not expect spontaneous improvement
   - Furosemide 40mg IV and hydral IV prn
   - Continue Valsartan 80mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO,
   metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine
   - PRN hydralazine and will start labetalol drip if neccessary to
   maintain SBP<180
   - F/U read MRI
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Pt had
   increasing pulmonary edema (cephalization) on chest x-ray but oxygen
   requirement mildly improved from admission. Currently satting mid 90s
   on 2L, appears comfortable.
   - received Furosemide 40mg IV x 1 today
   - will dose daily based on exam
   # Pneumonia - Pt with low grade fevers, productive cough, infiltrate on
   CXR and Moraxella in sputum cx. Continues to have productive cough.
   Oxygenation marginally improved. CXR was clear on admission and on
   [**11-30**] so may have health care associated pneumonia but currently doing
   well on CTX/Azithro.
   - Continue empiric CAP coverage with ceftriaxone and azithromycin for
   10-day course. Sputum cx grew moraxella which would be covered by
   current regimen.  Azithromycin to finish on [**12-5**], ceftriaxone on
   [**2172-12-10**].
   - Continue benzonatate and codeine
   - Consulted physical therapy for chest physical therapy, appreciate
   assistance
   # Abdominal pain, nausea: Stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and
   normal lactate. Possibly represents intestinal angina vs. dyspepsia.
   Amylase and lipase reviously normal but can recheck in am
   - Continue to monitor, repeat lactate if needed
   - repeat amylase and lipase
   - Guaiac stools
   # Chronic renal failure (bl 1.4-1.6): Stable, renally dose meds,
   continuing valsartan. Will closely follow renal function with increased
   dose valsartan.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of mesenteric ischemia and TIA, who was transferred to the MICU with hypertensive emergency, which has now resolved. She has chronic renal failure, anemia, and is being treated for pneumonia, abdominal pain, and hypertension. Her current vital signs are: Tmax 37.9°C, Tcurrent 36.9°C, HR 83 bpm, BP 165/41 mmHg, RR 22 breaths/min, SpO2 97%. She is receiving various medications, including labetalol, pantoprazole, heparin, and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertension: Despite improvement, the patient's hypertension is still not fully controlled, and there is a risk of recurrent hypertensive emergency.
2. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen with continued use of renally dosed medications, and close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen if not properly treated, and there is a risk of healthcare-associated pneumonia.
4. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain may be a sign of intestinal angina or dyspepsia, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly treated, and close monitoring of hemoglobin levels is necessary.
6. Fluid Imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, and there is a risk of fluid overload or dehydration.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen requirement is still mild, but there is a risk of respiratory failure if her pneumonia worsens or if she develops respiratory muscle weakness.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of hypertension and chronic renal failure increases her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions to prevent complications and improve her overall outcome."

* Cr: 1.7 mg/dL (normal range 0.5-1.2 mg/dL)
* Glucose: 132 mg/dL (normal range 70-110 mg/dL)

The patient is receiving various medications, including ceftriaxone, and has an IV line placed. They are also receiving prophylactic treatment for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and abdominal pain may lead to respiratory compromise, which can worsen their condition.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypertension and hypertensive crisis may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate kidney damage, which can worsen their condition and increase the risk of complications.
4. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and abdominal pain may lead to secondary infections, which can worsen their condition and increase the risk of complications.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: Mrs. [**Known lastname 7199**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with PMH of mesenteric
   ischemia and TIA a/w abdominal pain and hyponatremia transferred to
   MICU with with hypertensive emergency now resolved.
   #Hypertensive urgency/emergency: Pt with hypertensive urgency vs.
   emergency. Currently BP improved after receiving IV labetalol. Had HA
   and SBP>200 but resolved. Floor team was having difficulty achieving
   control (systolic > 210) despite metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 40mg
   daily, and amlodipine 10 in addition to standing hydralazine 25mg PO
   q6H with PRN 10mg IV. They also tried enalaprilat with no effect.
   However, upon transfer, pts SBPs 150s and has not required further
   expansion of antihypertensive regimen. Possibly was hypertensive from
   constipation and abdominal pain which is now improved.  CT and MRI
   showed no sign of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.
   - Will discontinue labetalol drip today given improvement to SBP down
   to 130
s to 150
s, goal should be around 150 systolic
   - Will restart oral regimen of Valsartan 80mg daily,
   hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO, metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 10mg
   QD
   - Will make hydralazine PRN, and will consider nitropaste for elevated
   pressures
   - F/U formal read of MRI
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Pt had
   increasing pulmonary edema (cephalization) on chest x-ray but oxygen
   requirement mildly improved from admission. Currently satting mid 90s
   on 2L, appears comfortable.
   - received Furosemide 40mg IV x 1 yesterday
   - will dose daily based on exam
   # Pneumonia - Pt with low grade fevers, productive cough, infiltrate on
   CXR and Moraxella in sputum cx. Continues to have productive cough.
   Oxygenation improved. CXR was clear on admission and on [**11-30**] so may
   have health care associated pneumonia but currently doing well.
   Completed azithromycin course, on day 5 of ceftriaxone, last day
   [**2172-12-10**].
   - Continue benzonatate and codeine for symptomatic relief of cough
   - Consulted physical therapy for chest physical therapy, appreciate
   assistance
   # Abdominal pain, nausea: Stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and
   normal lactate. Possibly represents intestinal angina vs. dyspepsia vs.
   gastritis.
   - Continue bowel regimen as this is likely related to constipation, if
   worsens consider KUB to rule out obstruction
   - Continue pantoprazole
   - Guaiac stools
   # Chronic renal failure (bl 1.4-1.6): Stable, continue to renally dose
   meds, continuing valsartan. Will closely follow renal function with
   increased dose valsartan.
   - at baseline. will follow
   # Anemia: Stable recently, iron deficiency?  Continue iron
   supplementation
   - continue to trend
   - guaiac stools
   # TIA history:  No mental status changes.  CT negative for acute

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   ASSESSMENT & PLAN: Mrs. [**Known lastname 7199**] is a [**Age over 90 **] yo F with PMH of mesenteric
   ischemia and TIA a/w abdominal pain and hyponatremia transferred to
   MICU with with hypertensive emergency now resolved.
   #Hypertensive urgency/emergency: Pt with hypertensive urgency vs.
   emergency. Currently BP improved after receiving IV labetalol. Had HA
   and SBP>200 but resolved. Floor team was having difficulty achieving
   control (systolic > 210) despite metoprolol 100 [**Hospital1 **], valsartan 40mg
   daily, and amlodipine 10 in addition to standing hydralazine 25mg PO
   q6H with PRN 10mg IV. They also tried enalaprilat with no effect.
   However, upon transfer, pts SBPs 150s and has not required further
   expansion of antihypertensive regimen. Possibly was hypertensive from
   constipation and abdominal pain which is now improved.  CT and MRI
   showed no sign of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.
   - Will discontinue labetalol drip today given improvement to SBP down
   to 130
s to 150
s, goal should be around 150 systolic
   - Will restart oral regimen of Valsartan 80mg daily,
   hydrochlorothiazide 25mg PO, metoprolol 100mg [**Hospital1 **] and amlodipine 10mg
   QD
   - Will make hydralazine PRN, and will consider nitropaste for elevated
   pressures
   - F/U formal read of MRI
   # Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: Pt had
   increasing pulmonary edema (cephalization) on chest x-ray but oxygen
   requirement mildly improved from admission. Currently satting mid 90s
   on 2L, appears comfortable.
   - received Furosemide 40mg IV x 1 yesterday
   - will dose daily based on exam
   # Pneumonia - Pt with low grade fevers, productive cough, infiltrate on
   CXR and Moraxella in sputum cx. Continues to have productive cough.
   Oxygenation improved. CXR was clear on admission and on [**11-30**] so may
   have health care associated pneumonia but currently doing well.
   Completed azithromycin course, on day 5 of ceftriaxone, last day
   [**2172-12-10**].
   - Continue benzonatate and codeine for symptomatic relief of cough
   - Consulted physical therapy for chest physical therapy, appreciate
   assistance
   # Abdominal pain, nausea: Stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and
   normal lactate. Possibly represents intestinal angina vs. dyspepsia vs.
   gastritis.
   - Continue bowel regimen as this is likely related to constipation, if
   worsens consider KUB to rule out obstruction
   - Continue pantoprazole
   - Guaiac stools
   # Chronic renal failure (bl 1.4-1.6): Stable, continue to renally dose
   meds, continuing valsartan. Will closely follow renal function with
   increased dose valsartan.
   - at baseline. will follow
   # Anemia: Stable recently, iron deficiency?  Continue iron
   supplementation

The patient's medical history includes mesenteric ischemia, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and hyponatremia. She has a history of pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and abdominal pain, including abdominal tenderness.

The patient's current medications include:

* Ceftriaxone
* Labetalol
* Valsartan
* Hydrochlorothiazide
* Metoprolol
* Amlodipine
* Hydralazine
* Furosemide
* Pantoprazole
* Benzonatate
* Codeine
* Aggrenox
* Simvastatin

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Discontinuing labetalol drip due to improved blood pressure
* Restarting oral regimen of Valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and amlodipine
* Making hydralazine PRN and considering nitropaste for elevated pressures
* Following up on a formal read of MRI
* Continuing to monitor and manage the patient's chronic renal failure
* Continuing iron supplementation for anemia
* Continuing treatment for pneumonia, including benzonatate and codeine for symptomatic relief of cough
* Consulting physical therapy for chest physical therapy

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Hypertensive crisis or emergency if blood pressure is not well-controlled
* Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure if cardiac function is not well-managed
* Pneumonia progression or complications if antibiotic treatment is not effective
* Abdominal pain progression or complications if constipation or intestinal angina is not managed
* Chronic renal failure progression if renal function is not closely monitored and managed
* Anemia worsening if iron supplementation is not effective
* TIA recurrence if underlying causes are not addressed

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent or manage these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient, a 90-year-old female, is being treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for hypertensive urgency, acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, pneumonia, abdominal pain, and chronic renal failure. She was admitted with a blood pressure of 204/77 mmHg, which has improved after treatment with labetalol and hydralazine. Her respiratory status is stable, with oxygen saturation of 98% on 2L NC. Her abdominal pain is stable, with negative CTA for ischemia and normal lactate. Her chronic renal failure is stable, and she is being closely monitored for changes in her renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and she may be at risk for another hypertensive crisis if her blood pressure is not properly controlled.
2. Heart failure: The patient's acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure may worsen if her blood pressure is not controlled, and she may experience worsening pulmonary edema.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen if she does not receive proper treatment, and she may experience respiratory failure.
4. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain may worsen if her constipation is not properly managed, and she may experience bowel obstruction.
5. Chronic renal failure: The patient's chronic renal failure may worsen if her blood pressure is not properly controlled, and she may experience worsening kidney function.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she does not receive proper treatment, and she may experience fatigue and weakness.
7. TIA history: The patient's history of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) may increase her risk for stroke, and she may experience worsening cognitive function.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to closely monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust her medication as needed to prevent hypertensive crisis.
2. Continue to treat the patient's pneumonia with antibiotics and oxygen therapy, and monitor her respiratory status closely.
3. Continue to manage the patient's abdominal pain with bowel regimen and consider KUB to rule out obstruction if necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's chronic renal failure and adjust her medication as needed to prevent worsening kidney function.
5. Continue to treat the patient's anemia with iron supplementation and monitor her hematocrit levels closely.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's TIA history and adjust her medication as needed to prevent stroke."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for management of hypertensive urgency. She has a history of pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP), abdominal pain, and hypertension.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 156/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination is notable for diminished breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin with trace pre-tibial edema. Neurologically, she is attentive and responds to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Serum creatinine is elevated at 1.8 mg/dL, and blood glucose is 175 mg/dL. Other laboratory results, including electrolyte levels and liver function tests, are within normal limits.

The patient is receiving antibiotics for pneumonia, and her abdominal pain has improved with bowel movement. She is being managed for hypertension with increased doses of Valsartan and po Hydralazine, and her blood pressure remains labile.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure remains labile, and there is a risk of further elevation, which can lead to end-organ damage.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia, and there is a risk of progression to severe pneumonia or respiratory failure.
3. Abdominal pain: Although the patient's abdominal pain has improved, there is a risk of recurrent pain or worsening of symptoms, particularly if there is underlying bowel obstruction or ischemia.
4. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's serum creatinine is elevated, and there is a risk of further electrolyte imbalance, particularly if her blood pressure remains uncontrolled.
5. Infection: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing secondary infections, particularly if her immune system is compromised.

In summary, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including hypertension, pneumonia, and abdominal pain. She is being managed in the ICU for hypertensive urgency and requires close monitoring to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.
