   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   74 yo man with cryptogenic cirrhosis, ESRD on HD.  came for bleeding
   from fistual site.  Was admitted for bleeding fistual on [**5-19**]. In ED
   had not active bleeding, but noted to have postive blood cx from prior
   admission.  Remarked that he was feeling bad, admitted to floor.  BP
   was 60/d on lower extremity.  Was mentating well and asymptomatic.
   Midodrine was restarted and got 1L IVF, with no improvement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old man with cryptogenic cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who was admitted for bleeding from a fistula site. He has a history of portal vein thrombosis, multiple surgeries, and is currently experiencing bleeding from the fistula site. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 89/50 mmHg and a heart rate of 106 bpm. He is experiencing tachycardia, leukocytosis, and bleeding from the fistula site. His laboratory results show anemia, and his microbiology results indicate the presence of Gram-positive cocci in chains.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Bleeding from the fistula site: The patient's bleeding from the fistula site is a significant concern, and further evaluation and management are necessary to prevent further bleeding and ensure hemostasis.
2. Infection: The patient's microbiology results indicate the presence of Gram-positive cocci in chains, which could indicate an infection. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the source and severity of the infection.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia could be a sign of underlying cardiac disease or infection, and further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and prevent complications.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis could be a sign of infection or inflammation, and further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and prevent complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia could be a sign of chronic disease or bleeding, and further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and prevent complications.
6. Dialysis catheter complications: The patient's dialysis catheter was inserted on the same day as admission, and further evaluation and management are necessary to ensure proper function and prevent complications.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of portal vein thrombosis and ESRD on hemodialysis increases his risk of cardiovascular complications, and further evaluation and management are necessary to prevent and manage these complications.

Based on the patient's medical history, laboratory results, and current condition, it is essential to continue monitoring and managing his bleeding, infection, tachycardia, leukocytosis, anemia, and dialysis catheter complications to prevent further complications and ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with cryptogenic cirrhosis and ESRD on HD admitted with bleeding
   fistula and bacteremia with hypotension on floor.
   # Hypotension: Pt has chronically low BP with SBP 60s-70s UEs and
   100s-120s LEs but BP on arrival to floor 60/D in LUE and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/L. In
   retrospect, this may have been a false measurement as pt mentating at
   baseline throughout and LE BPs here now measured back at baseline.
   Unlikely that midodrine would effect a change so quickly. Pt is s/p 1L
   IV fluids so could have had a component of hypovolemia from increased
   fluid removal at HD and/or blood loss from fistula. Differential does
   include sepsis however from bacteremia given known positive blood cx.
   AM cortisol previously checked [**5-/2106**] and was WNL at 22.
   - closely follow BPs in UEs and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   - [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] need small IV boluses to maintain goal SBP >70 in UE >90 in LE
   - no pressors needed
   - cont midodrine for now
   - trend lactate to assess end organ perfusion
   - follow up surveillance cx and speciation of GPCs
   - daptomycin as below
   # Bacteremia: Pt afebrile with mild leukocytosis (no left-shift). GPCs
   in chains growing from [**5-19**] blood cx now proven to be enterococcus (no
   sensitivities). PICC tip cx no growth (final). No other localizing s/s
   infection aside from sacral/perineal skin break down. No murmur or
   stigmata of endocarditis appreciated.
   - daptomycin given after HD
   - F/U blood cx
   - Depending on micro data, may need TTE
   # R AV fistula bleeding: Pt now presenting with second episode of
   bleeding from AV fistula in last 2 HD sessions. He was seen by
   transplant surgery in ED and they felt bleeding had resolved however
   will likely need some intervention or plan since pt cannot be referred
   to ED and admitted each HD session.
   - continue to monitor
   - repeat HCT, am coags
   - type and screen
   - appreciate transplant surgery recommendations
   - fistulogram reportedly normal
   # Tachycardia: C/w baseline HR in 110s.  Difficult to assess if afib
   given poor baseline; not noted in PMH.
   - Monitor on tele, repeat EKG
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to bacteremia. Has trended down from
   yesterday, possibly since PICC line removed. Pt does have chronic
   diarrhea but C. diff is on differential.
   - trend
   - check C. diff

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with cryptogenic cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) admission with bleeding fistula and bacteremia. He has been experiencing hypotension, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. His blood cultures grew Enterococcus, and he was started on daptomycin. He has a history of VRE and was changed to daptomycin accordingly. His PICC tip culture showed no growth. He has a sacral decubitus ulcer, oral candidiasis, and chronic diarrhea. His platelet count is low, and he has been experiencing bleeding from his AV fistula.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and hypotension make him at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Endocarditis: Although the patient's blood cultures grew Enterococcus, there is no evidence of endocarditis, but it is a potential complication to consider.
3. Fistula bleeding: The patient's AV fistula is bleeding, and he may require further intervention or treatment to stop the bleeding.
4. Hypovolemia: The patient's hypotension may be due to hypovolemia, which could be exacerbated by his chronic diarrhea and bleeding from the fistula.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be a sign of underlying infection or inflammation, and it should be closely monitored.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of infection or inflammation, and it should be closely monitored.
7. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer may become infected, and it should be closely monitored for signs of infection.
8. Oral candidiasis: The patient's oral candidiasis may be a sign of immunocompromised state, and it should be treated promptly.
9. Chronic diarrhea: The patient's chronic diarrhea may be a sign of underlying infection or inflammation, and it should be closely monitored.
10. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be a sign of underlying infection or inflammation, and it should be closely monitored.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood cultures and follow-up with surveillance cultures to ensure that the bacteremia is being effectively treated.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and administer small IV boluses as needed to maintain a goal SBP >70 in the upper extremities and >90 in the lower extremities.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's lactate levels to assess end-organ perfusion.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusing platelets if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's AV fistula for signs of bleeding or infection.
6. Consider performing a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) to rule out endocarditis.
7. Consider performing a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule out other potential causes of bleeding or infection.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's sacral decubitus ulcer for signs of infection and consider debridement if necessary.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's oral candidiasis and consider treating with antifungal medication if necessary.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's chronic diarrhea and consider treating with antidiarrheal medication if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with cryptogenic cirrhosis and ESRD on HD admitted with bleeding
   fistula and bacteremia with hypotension on floor.
   # Hypotension: Pt has chronically low BP with SBP 60s-70s UEs and
   100s-120s LEs but BP on arrival to floor 60/D in LUE and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/L. In
   retrospect, this may have been a false measurement as pt mentating at
   baseline throughout and LE BPs here now measured back at baseline.
   Unlikely that midodrine would effect a change so quickly. Pt is s/p 1L
   IV fluids so could have had a component of hypovolemia from increased
   fluid removal at HD and/or blood loss from fistula. Differential
   however does include sepsis from bacteremia given known positive blood
   cx. AM cortisol previously checked [**5-/2106**] and was WNL at 22.
   - closely follow BPs in UEs and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   - [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] need small IV boluses to maintain goal SBP >70 in UE, >90 in LE
   - no pressors needed
   - cont midodrine for now
   - trend lactate to assess end organ perfusion: currently elevated to
   5.4 but in setting of Cr elevation; will repeat
   - follow up surveillance cx and speciation of GPCs
   - daptomycin as below
   # Bacteremia: Pt afebrile with mild leukocytosis (no left-shift). GPCs
   in chains growing from [**5-19**] blood cx now proven to be enterococcus (no
   sensitivities). PICC tip cx no growth (final). No other localizing s/s
   infection aside from sacral/perineal skin break down. No murmur or
   stigmata of endocarditis appreciated.
   - daptomycin given after HD, day 1 = [**5-21**]
   - F/U blood cx
   - Depending on micro data, ordered for TTE
   # R AV fistula bleeding: Pt now presenting with second episode of
   bleeding from AV fistula in last 2 HD sessions. He was seen by
   transplant surgery in ED and they felt bleeding had resolved however
   will likely need some intervention or plan since pt cannot be referred
   to ED and admitted each HD session.
   - continue to monitor
   - repeat HCT, am coags
   - type and screen
   - appreciate transplant surgery recommendations
   - fistulogram reportedly normal
   # Tachycardia: C/w baseline HR in 110s.  Difficult to assess if afib
   given poor baseline; not noted in PMH.
   - Monitor on tele, repeat EKG
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to bacteremia. Has trended down from
   yesterday, possibly since PICC line removed. Pt does have chronic
   diarrhea but C. diff is on differential.
   - trend
   - C. diff negative X1
   - cont vanc as above
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Currently does not appear infected.
   - lidocaine jelly
   - f/u any new wound consult recommendations
   # Oral candidiasis: Concerning for immunocompromised state given HIV
   risk factors but has reportedly refused testing in past
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   # ESRD: On HD T,TH, Sat.
   - Continue nephrocaps.
   - f/u renal recs
   # Cryptogenic cirrhosis: Stable. Continue rifaximin.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Elevated from baseline
   .
   # Chronic diarrhea: Pt has chronic diarrhea but given concern for C
   diff will hold loperamide until ruled out C diff again, continue
   cholesytramine
   - c. diff negative X1
   - Restart loperamide given negative c diff
   .

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with cryptogenic cirrhosis and ESRD on hemodialysis (HD) admitted with bleeding fistula and bacteremia. He has a history of chronic diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and oral candidiasis. The patient's current vital signs include a blood pressure of 88/48 mmHg, heart rate of 101 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He has a temperature of 36°C, and his respiratory rate is 12 inspirations per minute. The patient's physical examination reveals a cachectic male who is tired but alert, with scleral icterus, mild tachycardia, and irregular rhythm.

The patient has a number of medical complications, including:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and he is at risk of developing septic shock.
2. Bacteremia: The patient has a positive blood culture for Enterococcus, which is resistant to antibiotics.
3. Bleeding fistula: The patient has had two episodes of bleeding from his arteriovenous (AV) fistula, which is a concern.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be related to his bacteremia or other underlying conditions.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may be related to his bacteremia or other underlying conditions.
6. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer that is not currently infected.
7. Oral candidiasis: The patient has oral candidiasis, which is a concern given his immunocompromised state.
8. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be related to his underlying conditions.
9. Chronic diarrhea: The patient has chronic diarrhea, which may be related to his underlying conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: The patient is at risk of developing septic shock due to his bacteremia and low blood pressure.
2. Endocarditis: The patient's bacteremia may lead to endocarditis, which is a life-threatening condition.
3. Kidney injury: The patient's underlying kidney disease may worsen due to his bacteremia and low blood pressure.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying respiratory disease may worsen due to his bacteremia and low blood pressure.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's chronic diarrhea may worsen due to his bacteremia and low blood pressure.
6. Wound infection: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer may become infected, which could lead to a life-threatening condition.
7. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS): The patient's bacteremia may lead to SIRS, which is a life-threatening condition."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a bleeding fistula, hypotension, and septic shock. They have a history of enterococcus bacteremia and are being treated with daptomycin and hemodialysis. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 79/50 mmHg, and a lactate level of 5.4 mmol/L. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 94%. They are also receiving fluid resuscitation and have a total fluid balance of 730 mL over the past 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient's septic shock is being treated with antibiotics and hemodialysis, but there is a risk of further deterioration and organ failure.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's bleeding fistula is a significant concern, and there is a risk of further bleeding and hemorrhage.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is a sign of inadequate perfusion and may lead to organ damage and failure if not addressed.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration and respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiac compromise, and there is a risk of cardiac arrest if not addressed.
6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and there is a risk of further renal damage and failure if not addressed.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and lack of movement may indicate neurological compromise, and there is a risk of further neurological damage and failure if not addressed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely.
2. Adjust fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy as needed to maintain adequate perfusion.
3. Consider further imaging studies to evaluate the bleeding fistula and potential sources of bleeding.
4. Continue antibiotics and hemodialysis as prescribed.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
6. Consider consulting cardiology and nephrology services to optimize cardiac and renal function.
7. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider consulting neurology services if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour ICU admission with a chief complaint of sinus tachycardia and occasional PVCs. The patient has a history of VRE and is currently receiving daptomycin. The patient's blood culture grew Enterococcus, but sensitivity results showed pan-sensitivity, allowing for a potential switch to ampicillin. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, with a blood pressure of 73/39 mmHg, and has required a gentle 250cc bolus to maintain blood pressure. The patient's renal plan includes hemodialysis tomorrow.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 13.0-11.3 K/uL
* Hct: 43.6-37.8%
* Plt: 105-81 K/uL
* Cr: 4.7-3.1 mg/dL
* Glucose: 131-126 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 21.9/38.6/2.0, Lactic Acid: 4.7 mmol/L, Ca++: 8.3 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.7 mg/dL, PO4: 2.4 mg/dL

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's blood culture grew Enterococcus, and the patient's blood pressure is low, indicating a potential risk of septic shock.
2. Infection: The patient's wound is at risk of infection due to impaired skin integrity, and the patient's blood culture growing Enterococcus increases the risk of infection.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential renal failure, which could worsen if the patient's blood pressure is not maintained.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating a potential risk of organ dysfunction and increased risk of sepsis.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show an electrolyte imbalance, which could worsen if not addressed.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's SpO2 is 98%, indicating potential respiratory failure if not monitored closely.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia with occasional PVCs, indicating potential cardiovascular instability."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a cachectic male in the ICU with a complex medical history. The note highlights several key events and findings.

The patient's blood cultures grew Enterococcus, which was initially resistant to antibiotics. However, subsequent sensitivities showed that the Enterococcus is pan-sensitive, allowing for the potential to switch antibiotics to ampicillin.

The patient has been experiencing sinus arrhythmia and occasional PVCs, which may be related to his underlying medical conditions. He has also been experiencing difficulty in obtaining lab samples due to low magnesium and phosphate levels, which have been repleted.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, and blood pressure of 73/39 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 98%.

The patient's physical examination reveals scleral icterus, oral thrush, and ascites, as well as irregular rhythm with mild tachycardia. His abdomen is soft and distended, with bowel sounds present. He has 3+ edema to the upper thigh and cool to touch skin.

Laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL and a platelet count of 81 K/uL. His liver enzymes are elevated, with a bilirubin level of 3.4 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hyperglycemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's Enterococcus infection, there is a risk of sepsis developing, which could lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus arrhythmia and PVCs may be a sign of underlying cardiac disease, which could lead to cardiac arrest or arrhythmia-related complications.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ascites and distended abdomen may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hemorrhage and hypovolemic shock.
4. Renal failure: The patient's anemia, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia may increase the risk of renal failure, which could lead to end-stage renal disease.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity may increase the risk of skin breakdown, which could lead to infections and sepsis.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to prevent potential complications and optimize his care."

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with cryptogenic cirrhosis and ESRD on HD admitted with bleeding
   fistula and bacteremia with hypotension on floor.
   # Hypotension: Pt has chronically low BP with SBP 60s-70s UEs and
   100s-120s LEs but BP on arrival to floor 60/D in LUE and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/L. In
   retrospect, this may have been a false measurement as pt mentating at
   baseline throughout and LE BPs here now measured back at baseline.
   Unlikely that midodrine would effect a change so quickly. Pt is s/p 1L
   IV fluids so could have had a component of hypovolemia from increased
   fluid removal at HD and/or blood loss from fistula. Differential
   however does include sepsis from bacteremia given known positive blood
   cx, now speciated to sensitive entertococcus. AM cortisol previously
   checked [**5-/2106**] and was WNL at 22.
   - closely follow BPs in UEs and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   - [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] need small IV boluses to maintain goal SBP >70 in UE, >90 in LE
   - no pressors needed
   - cont midodrine for now
   - trend lactate to assess end organ perfusion: currently elevated to
   4.7 but in setting of Cr elevation; will repeat again this morning
   - change Abx as below
   # Bacteremia: Pt afebrile with mild leukocytosis (no left-shift). GPCs
   in chains growing from [**5-19**] blood cx now proven to be enterococcus (no
   sensitivities). PICC tip cx no growth (final). No other localizing s/s
   infection aside from sacral/perineal skin break down. No murmur or
   stigmata of endocarditis appreciated.
   - daptomycin given after HD, day 1 = [**5-21**]
 consider change to
   ampicillin given enterococcus is sensitive
   - F/U blood cx
   - Depending on micro data, ordered for TTE (not done yesterday)
   # R AV fistula bleeding: Pt now presenting with second episode of
   bleeding from AV fistula in last 2 HD sessions. He was seen by
   transplant surgery in ED and they felt bleeding had resolved however
   will likely need some intervention or plan since pt cannot be referred
   to ED and admitted each HD session.  Fistulogram read as normal.  Hct
   dropped to 37.8 from recent baseline in 40s (could also relate to fluid
   shifts from HD schedule).
   - continue to monitor
   - repeat HCT, am coags
   - type and screen
   - appreciate transplant surgery recommendations
   # Tachycardia: C/w baseline HR in 110s.  Difficult to assess if afib
   given poor baseline; not noted in PMH.
   - Monitor on tele, repeat EKG
   # Brief runs of VT: Noted on telemetry.
   - Replete Mg PRN (monitor K but would not replete given ESRD unless
   low)
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to bacteremia. Has trended down from
   yesterday, possibly since PICC line removed. Pt does have chronic
   diarrhea but C. diff is on differential.
   - trend
   - C. diff negative X1
   - cont Abx as above
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Currently does not appear infected.
   - lidocaine jelly
   - follow wound consult recommendations
   # Oral candidiasis: Concerning for immunocompromised state given HIV
   risk factors but has reportedly refused testing in past
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   # ESRD: On HD T,TH, Sat.
   - Continue nephrocaps.
   - f/u renal recs
   # Cryptogenic cirrhosis: Stable. Continue rifaximin.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Elevated from baseline
   .
   # Chronic diarrhea: Pt has chronic diarrhea but given concern for C
   diff will hold loperamide until ruled out C diff again, continue
   cholesytramine
   - c. diff negative X1
   - Restart loperamide given negative c diff
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, low Na, K diet

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with cryptogenic cirrhosis and ESRD on HD admitted with bleeding
   fistula and bacteremia with hypotension on floor.
   # Hypotension: Pt has chronically low BP with SBP 60s-70s UEs and
   100s-120s LEs but BP on arrival to floor 60/D in LUE and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/L. In
   retrospect, this may have been a false measurement as pt mentating at
   baseline throughout and LE BPs here now measured back at baseline.
   Unlikely that midodrine would effect a change so quickly. Pt is s/p 1L
   IV fluids so could have had a component of hypovolemia from increased
   fluid removal at HD and/or blood loss from fistula. Differential
   however does include sepsis from bacteremia given known positive blood
   cx, now speciated to sensitive entertococcus. AM cortisol previously
   checked [**5-/2106**] and was WNL at 22.
   - closely follow BPs in UEs and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   - [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] need small IV boluses to maintain goal SBP >70 in UE, >90 in LE
   - no pressors needed
   - cont midodrine for now
   - trend lactate to assess end organ perfusion: currently elevated to
   4.7 but in setting of Cr elevation; will repeat again this morning
   - change Abx as below
   # Bacteremia: Pt afebrile with mild leukocytosis (no left-shift). GPCs
   in chains growing from [**5-19**] blood cx now proven to be enterococcus (no
   sensitivities). PICC tip cx no growth (final). No other localizing s/s
   infection aside from sacral/perineal skin break down. No murmur or
   stigmata of endocarditis appreciated.
   - daptomycin given after HD, day 1 = [**5-21**]
 consider change to
   ampicillin given enterococcus is sensitive
   - F/U blood cx
   - Depending on micro data, ordered for TTE (not done yesterday)
   # R AV fistula bleeding: Pt now presenting with second episode of
   bleeding from AV fistula in last 2 HD sessions. He was seen by
   transplant surgery in ED and they felt bleeding had resolved however
   will likely need some intervention or plan since pt cannot be referred
   to ED and admitted each HD session.  Fistulogram read as normal.  Hct
   dropped to 37.8 from recent baseline in 40s (could also relate to fluid
   shifts from HD schedule).
   - continue to monitor
   - repeat HCT, am coags
   - type and screen
   - appreciate transplant surgery recommendations
   # Tachycardia: C/w baseline HR in 110s.  Difficult to assess if afib
   given poor baseline; not noted in PMH.
   - Monitor on tele, repeat EKG
   # Brief runs of VT: Noted on telemetry.
   - Replete Mg PRN (monitor K but would not replete given ESRD unless
   low)
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to bacteremia. Has trended down from
   yesterday, possibly since PICC line removed. Pt does have chronic
   diarrhea but C. diff is on differential.
   - trend
   - C. diff negative X1
   - cont Abx as above
   # Sacral decubitus ulcer: Currently does not appear infected.
   - lidocaine jelly
   - follow wound consult recommendations
   # Oral candidiasis: Concerning for immunocompromised state given HIV
   risk factors but has reportedly refused testing in past
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   # ESRD: On HD T,TH, Sat.
   - Continue nephrocaps.
   - f/u renal recs
   # Cryptogenic cirrhosis: Stable. Continue rifaximin.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Elevated from baseline
   .
   # Chronic diarrhea: Pt has chronic diarrhea but given concern for C
   diff will hold loperamide until ruled out C diff again, continue
   cholesytramine
   - c. diff negative X1
   - Restart loperamide given negative c diff
   .

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with cryptogenic cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) admission with bleeding fistula and bacteremia with hypotension on the floor. The patient's condition has been unstable, with multiple medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia with Enterococcus, which is sensitive to antibiotics, but the patient's lactate level is elevated, indicating end-organ perfusion dysfunction.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and the differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypovolemia, and bleeding from the fistula.
3. Bleeding from the fistula: The patient has had two episodes of bleeding from the fistula, and the fistulogram is normal, indicating a potential need for intervention or a plan to prevent further bleeding.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be related to the patient's underlying condition or the antibiotics.
5. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, and the differential diagnosis includes sepsis, hypovolemia, and atrial fibrillation.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be related to the bacteremia or chronic diarrhea.
7. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which may be at risk of infection.
8. Oral candidiasis: The patient has oral candidiasis, which may be related to the patient's immunocompromised state.
9. Chronic diarrhea: The patient has chronic diarrhea, which may be related to the patient's underlying condition or the antibiotics.
10. End-stage renal disease: The patient's kidney function is impaired, and the patient is on HD, which may require adjustments to the patient's treatment plan.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated lactate level
* Elevated white blood cell count
* Low platelet count
* Elevated creatinine level
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level
* Hypocalcemia
* Hypomagnesemia
* Hyperphosphatemia

The patient's medications include:

* Daptomycin
* Midodrine
* Loperamide
* Cholestyramine
* Rifaximin
* Tylenol
* Nystatin
* Lidocaine gel

The patient's care plan includes:

* Closely monitoring the patient's blood pressure and adjusting the treatment plan as needed
* Repeating the lactate level and adjusting the treatment plan as needed
* Changing the antibiotics to ampicillin based on the sensitivity results
* Monitoring the patient's bleeding from the fistula and adjusting the treatment plan as needed
* Continuing the nephrocaps and following up with renal recommendations
* Continuing rifaximin for the patient's cryptogenic cirrhosis
* Restarting loperamide if the patient's diarrhea is found to be related to C. diff
* Holding the bowel regimen until the patient's diarrhea is ruled out as C. diff
* Continuing pain management with tylenol."

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), cryptogenic cirrhosis, and a bleeding fistula. He has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of Enterococcus bacteremia and is receiving treatment with daptomycin and hemodialysis (HD). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 112 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 104/70 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (bpm). He is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 90%. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL, and is receiving blood transfusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's diagnosis of Enterococcus bacteremia and treatment with daptomycin increase the risk of sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status is necessary to detect early signs of sepsis.
2. Hemorrhage: The patient's bleeding fistula and anemia increase the risk of further bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status is necessary to detect early signs of bleeding.
3. Decubitus Ulcers: The patient's skin integrity is impaired, and he has stage 2 and 3 sacral ulcers. Close monitoring of wound care and pressure ulcer prevention is necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's SpO2 of 90% and ABG results suggest that he may be at risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygen therapy is necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's sinus tachycardia and hypertension increase the risk of cardiac complications. Close monitoring of cardiac status and treatment of hypertension are necessary to prevent cardiac complications.
6. Infection: The patient's diagnosis of Enterococcus bacteremia increases the risk of infection. Close monitoring of laboratory results and clinical status is necessary to detect early signs of infection.
7. Renal Complications: The patient's ESRD and treatment with HD increase the risk of renal complications. Close monitoring of laboratory results and clinical status is necessary to detect early signs of renal complications.
8. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's malnutrition and impaired skin integrity increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies. Close monitoring of nutritional status and provision of adequate nutrition are necessary to prevent nutritional deficiencies."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

1. Septic Shock: The patient's diagnosis of Enterococcus bacteremia and septic shock poses a high risk of complications, including organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
2. Bleeding Complications: The patient's bleeding fistula and impaired coagulation function due to ESRD and cirrhosis increase the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.
3. Decubitus Ulcers: The patient's impaired skin integrity and presence of decubitus ulcers increase the risk of further skin breakdown and infection.
4. Wound Infection: The patient's bleeding fistula and impaired wound healing due to ESRD and cirrhosis increase the risk of wound infection.
5. Dialysis-Related Complications: The patient's ESRD and need for dialysis increase the risk of dialysis-related complications, including hypotension, electrolyte imbalance, and access site infections.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory support with nasal cannula and ABG results of 31 mmHg increase the risk of respiratory failure.
7. Cardiac Complications: The patient's tachycardia and potential cardiac dysfunction due to ESRD and cirrhosis increase the risk of cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest and arrhythmias.
8. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's need for dialysis and potential malnutrition due to ESRD and cirrhosis increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies, including protein-energy malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies.

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk of developing various medical complications, including septic shock, bleeding complications, decubitus ulcers, wound infection, dialysis-related complications, respiratory failure, cardiac complications, and nutritional deficiencies. Close monitoring and management of these complications are essential to ensure the patient's optimal care and outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 71-inch tall individual with a baseline CK level to be checked with Dapto. The patient has a VRE infection, which is being treated with Daptomycin. The patient has a history of diarrhea and has been started on octreotide. The patient has had a 15-second run of VT overnight, which broke with waking the patient, with no reported symptoms. The patient has difficulty drawing AM labs, and phlebotomy will be attempted in the morning.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a VRE infection, which is a type of gram-positive bacteria that can cause sepsis, a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ failure.
2. Daptomycin resistance: The patient is being treated with Daptomycin, but the growth of E. fecalis AND E. faecium in the dialysis catheter culture may indicate resistance to the antibiotic, which could lead to treatment failure.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's diarrhea may be a sign of an underlying infection or inflammatory process, which could lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and other complications.
4. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient's 15-second run of VT overnight may be a sign of an underlying cardiac condition, which could lead to arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or other cardiac complications.
5. Bloodstream infection: The patient's dialysis catheter culture growing E. fecalis AND E. faecium may indicate a bloodstream infection, which could lead to sepsis, endocarditis, or other complications.
6. DVT: The patient's history of VRE infection and the presence of a dialysis catheter may increase the risk of developing DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or other complications.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's history of diarrhea and the presence of a dialysis catheter may increase the risk of developing a stress ulcer, which could lead to bleeding, perforation, or other complications.
8. VAP: The patient's history of VRE infection and the presence of a dialysis catheter may increase the risk of developing VAP, which could lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, or other complications.

These potential complications will require close monitoring and management to prevent or treat them effectively."

   Ordered for TTE but not yet done
   Assessment and Plan
   74M with cryptogenic cirrhosis and ESRD on HD admitted with bleeding
   fistula and bacteremia with hypotension on floor.
   # Hypotension: Pt has chronically low BP with SBP 60s-70s UEs and
   100s-120s LEs but BP on arrival to floor 60/D in LUE and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/L. In
   retrospect, this may have been a false measurement as pt mentating at
   baseline throughout and LE BPs here now measured back at baseline.
   Unlikely that midodrine would effect a change so quickly. Pt is s/p 1L
   IV fluids so could have had a component of hypovolemia from increased
   fluid removal at HD and/or blood loss from fistula. Differential
   however does include sepsis from bacteremia given known positive blood
   cx, now speciated to sensitive entertococcus. AM cortisol previously
   checked [**5-/2106**] and was WNL at 22.
   - closely follow BPs in UEs and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   - [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] need small IV boluses to maintain goal SBP >70 in UE, >90 in LE
   - no pressors needed
   - cont midodrine for now
   - trend lactate to assess end organ perfusion: currently elevated to
   4.7 but in setting of Cr elevation; will repeat again this morning
   .
   # Bacteremia: Pt afebrile with mild leukocytosis (no left-shift). GPCs
   in chains growing from [**5-19**] blood cx now proven to be enterococcus (no
   sensitivities). PICC tip cx no growth (final). No other localizing s/s
   infection aside from sacral/perineal skin break down. No murmur or
   stigmata of endocarditis appreciated.

   hemodialysis

    .
   # R AV fistula bleeding: Pt now presenting with second episode of
   bleeding from AV fistula in last 2 HD sessions. He was seen by
   transplant surgery in ED and they felt bleeding had resolved however
   will likely need some intervention or plan since pt cannot be referred
   to ED and admitted each HD session.  Fistulogram read as normal.  Hct
   dropped to 37.8 from recent baseline in 40s (could also relate to fluid
   shifts from HD schedule).
   - continue to monitor
   - repeat HCT, am coags
   - type and screen
   - appreciate transplant surgery recommendations
   # Tachycardia: C/w baseline HR in 110s.  Difficult to assess if afib
   given poor baseline; not noted in PMH.
   - Monitor on tele, repeat EKG
   # Brief runs of VT: Noted on telemetry.
   - Replete Mg PRN (monitor K but would not replete given ESRD unless
   low)
   # Leukocytosis: Likely related to bacteremia. Has trended down from
   yesterday, possibly since PICC line removed. Pt does have chronic
   diarrhea but C. diff is on differential.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with cryptogenic cirrhosis and ESRD on hemodialysis (HD) who was admitted to the ICU with bleeding from an arteriovenous (AV) fistula and bacteremia. He has a history of chronic diarrhea and is currently receiving treatment for E. faecalis and E. faecium bacteremia. His vital signs are stable, but he has tachycardia and hypertension. He has a sacral decubitus ulcer and oral candidiasis. His laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, thrombocytopenia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia and elevated lactate levels may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death if not treated promptly.
2. Fistula complications: The patient's AV fistula is bleeding, which may lead to further complications such as infection, thrombosis, or occlusion.
3. Endocarditis: The patient's bacteremia may have spread to his endocardium, leading to endocarditis, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.
4. Chronic diarrhea: The patient's chronic diarrhea may lead to electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, and malnutrition if not managed properly.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase his risk of bleeding, particularly if he undergoes invasive procedures.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen his fatigue, shortness of breath, and other symptoms.
7. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient's sacral decubitus ulcer may become infected, leading to further complications such as sepsis, osteomyelitis, or abscesses.
8. Oral candidiasis: The patient's oral candidiasis may lead to further complications such as thrush, esophagitis, or pneumonia if not treated promptly.
9. ESRD: The patient's ESRD may worsen his kidney function, leading to further complications such as acidosis, electrolyte imbalances, and anemia.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of complications, including sepsis, fistula complications, endocarditis, chronic diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, anemia, sacral decubitus ulcer, oral candidiasis, and ESRD. Close monitoring and prompt treatment of these complications are essential to improve the patient's outcome."

   baseline throughout and LE BPs here now measured back at baseline.
   Unlikely that midodrine would effect a change so quickly. Pt is s/p 1L
   IV fluids so could have had a component of hypovolemia from increased
   fluid removal at HD and/or blood loss from fistula. Differential
   however does include sepsis from bacteremia given known positive blood

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia with VRE, which can lead to sepsis, especially given his underlying chronic illness and immunocompromised state.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is chronically low, and the cause is unclear. This may be due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or other factors.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be related to sepsis, bacteremia, or other underlying conditions.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be related to bacteremia or other infections.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreased, which may be related to underlying chronic illness or medication.
6. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which may become infected if not properly managed.
7. Oral candidiasis: The patient has oral thrush, which may be related to his immunocompromised state.
8. Chronic diarrhea: The patient has chronic diarrhea, which may be related to his underlying chronic illness or medication.
9. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis, which may increase his risk of complications such as hypertension, anemia, and electrolyte imbalances.
10. Cryptogenic cirrhosis: The patient has cryptogenic cirrhosis, which may increase his risk of bleeding, ascites, and other complications.

The patient's plan of care should include:

1. Close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate.
2. Administration of antibiotics for bacteremia.
3. Management of sepsis, including fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support if necessary.
4. Monitoring of platelet count and coagulation studies.
5. Management of sacral decubitus ulcer, including wound care and consideration of surgical intervention if necessary.
6. Management of oral candidiasis, including antifungal therapy.
7. Management of chronic diarrhea, including consideration of antidiarrheal agents and stool softeners.
8. Continued hemodialysis and close monitoring of electrolyte levels.
9. Consideration of liver transplantation for the patient's cryptogenic cirrhosis.
10. Close communication with the patient and his family regarding his condition and plan of care."

   Assessment and Plan
   74M with cryptogenic cirrhosis and ESRD on HD admitted with bleeding
   fistula and bacteremia with hypotension on floor.
   .
   # Hypotension: Pt has chronically low BP with SBP 60s-70s UEs and
   100s-120s LEs but BP on arrival to floor 60/D in LUE and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **]/L. In
   retrospect, this may have been a false measurement as pt mentating at
   baseline throughout and LE BPs here now measured back at baseline.
   Unlikely that midodrine would effect a change so quickly. Pt is s/p 1L
   IV fluids so could have had a component of hypovolemia from increased
   fluid removal at HD and/or blood loss from fistula. Differential
   however does include sepsis from bacteremia given known positive blood
   cx, now speciated to sensitive entertococcus. AM cortisol previously
   checked [**5-/2106**] and was WNL at 22.
   - closely follow BPs in UEs and [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) **]
   - [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] need small IV boluses to maintain goal SBP >70 in UE, >90 in LE
   - no pressors needed
   - cont midodrine for now
   - trend lactate to assess end organ perfusion: currently elevated to
   4.7 but in setting of Cr elevation; will repeat again this morning
   .
   # Bacteremia: Pt afebrile with mild leukocytosis (no left-shift). GPCs
   in chains growing from [**5-19**] blood cx now proven to be enterococcus
   (VRE). PICC tip cx no growth (final). No other localizing s/s infection
   aside from sacral/perineal skin break down. No murmur or stigmata of
   endocarditis appreciated.
   - daptomycin q48h given after HD, day 1 = [**5-21**], for two week course
   with hemodialysis (change dialysis schedule so that it is q48h, i.e. T
   Th Sa M W F to complete 2 week course daptomycin, thus preventing need

   # Oxygen requirement:  Not on oxygen at baseline. No clear etiology;
   will monitor for now. Pt without cough.
   - Obtain CXR
   - wean as tolerated
   .
   # R AV fistula bleeding: Pt now presenting with second episode of
   bleeding from AV fistula in last 2 HD sessions. He was seen by
   transplant surgery in ED and they felt bleeding had resolved however
   will likely need some intervention or plan since pt cannot be referred
   to ED and admitted each HD session.  Fistulogram read as normal.  Hct
   dropped to 37.8 from recent baseline in 40s (could also relate to fluid
   shifts from HD schedule).
   - continue to monitor

   - Replete Mg PRN (monitor K but would not replete given ESRD unless
   low)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* The patient is a 74-year-old male with cryptogenic cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD).
* He has a history of bleeding fistula and bacteremia, which is currently being treated with daptomycin.
* The patient has chronic diarrhea, which is being managed with octreotide and cholesytramine.
* He has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which is not currently infected.
* The patient has oral candidiasis, which is being treated with nystatin swish and swallow.
* He has thrombocytopenia, which is elevated from baseline.
* The patient has a history of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), which is being monitored.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis from bacteremia
* Hypotension, which may be related to fluid shifts from HD or bleeding from the fistula
* End-organ perfusion impairment, which may be assessed by trending lactate levels
* Thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding
* Chronic diarrhea, which may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances
* Sacral decubitus ulcer, which may become infected if not properly managed
* Oral candidiasis, which may spread to other parts of the body if not treated
* VT, which may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.

The patient's current medications include:

* Daptomycin for bacteremia
* Octreotide for diarrhea
* Cholessytramine for diarrhea
* Nystatin swish and swallow for oral candidiasis
* Midodrine for hypotension
* Loperamide for chronic diarrhea
* Rifaximin for cryptogenic cirrhosis
* Tylenol for pain management

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 13.0
* Hct: 43.6
* Plt: 105
* Cr: 4.7
* Glucose: 131
* Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are:

* T: 37.2°C (98.6°F)
* HR: 88 bpm
* BP: 80/47 mmHg
* RR: 8 breaths/min
* SpO2: 94%

The patient's physical examination shows:

* Cachectic male, tired but alert, oriented x 3, no acute distress
* Sclera slightly icteric, MM dry, + oral thrush, oropharynx clear
* Supple neck, JVP not elevated
* Clear to auscultation bilaterally with faint crackles at bases, no wheezes or rhonchi
* Irregular rhythm with mild tachycardia, normal S1 + S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
* Soft, distended abdomen with +ascites, no rebound tenderness or guarding
* Cool to touch, Dopplerable pulses, 3+ edema to upper thigh, no clubbing or cyanosis
* RUE AV fistula with palpable thrill, no bleeding or bandage
* Oriented x 3, dry, cracked skin throughout, no stigmata of endocarditis appreciated."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient, a 74-year-old man with ESRD and cryptogenic cirrhosis, is currently in the ICU with bleeding fistula, hypotension, and Enterococcal bacteremia. He has been receiving daptomycin therapy with hemodialysis (HD) every 48 hours, but did not receive a dose yesterday. His vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.9°F)
* Heart rate: 92 bpm (normal range 85-250 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 98/64 mmHg (normal range 71-105/73 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 10 breaths per minute (normal range 8-18 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* No acute distress
* Normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat
* Normal cardiovascular examination, except for irregular irregular heart rhythm
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* No edema in the lower extremities
* Warm skin
* Attentive and follows simple commands, but movement, tone, and neurological examination were not assessed

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.6 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 13.0 K/uL
* Platelet count: 105 K/uL
* Creatinine: 4.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 177 mg/dL
* Glucose: 131 mg/dL
* Other labs show normal electrolyte levels, except for calcium (8.4 mg/dL) and magnesium (2.0 mg/dL)

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Ventricular tachycardia, non-sustained (NSVT)
* Impaired skin integrity
* Hypotension (not shock)
* Septic shock/Enterococcus bacteremia: treating with daptomycin and HD
* NSVT: keeping in-house telemetry monitoring
* Bleeding fistula: stable, no evidence of further bleeding
* ESRD: normal HD tomorrow
* Decub ulcers: continuing wound care
* Hypoxemia: checking CXR and oxygen requirement
* Remaining issues per ICU team

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to Enterococcus bacteremia
* Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation, due to NSVT
* Hemorrhagic complications due to bleeding fistula
* Wound infections due to impaired skin integrity
* Hypoxemia and respiratory failure due to hypotension and respiratory compromise
* Renal failure due to ESRD and potential nephrotoxicity of antibiotics
* Electrolyte imbalances due to abnormal laboratory values"
