   Assessment and Plan
   83y/o gentleman with a past medical history of aortic stenosis s/p
   prosthetic AVR, PAF on coumadin s/p TURP approximately 3 weeks ago who
   presented to the hospital with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU
   for hypotension in the setting of bleeding.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Most likely due to blood loss from persistent
   hematuria, however cardiac event is also a possiblity given acute
   nature.  ECG changes not worrisome for ACS.  Pt responded to fluids.
   Sepsis is less likely in this patient who does not have fevers or
   source of infection.  Risk of bleeding outweighs risk of embolic event
   and so INR reversal was recommended and completed.  Other etiologies
   include medications as pt has been receiving morphine boluses but this
   does not seem to correlate with timing of event.  Was also on
   Phenazopyridine for bladder spasms.
   - follow HCT q 8 hours and coags
   - continue with PRBC transfusion with goal HCT > 25
   - will monitor for pulmonary edema given history of aortic stenosis
   with valve replacement
   - Follow cardiac enzymes
   .
   #. Hematuria: s/p TURP 3 weeks ago.  Had Rouche catheter and 3 way
   CBI.  Unclear why bleeding is occurring 3 weeks after procedure.  Also
   occurred in the setting of INR of 3.1.
   - continue CBI will discuss volume with urology
   - f/u urology recs for definitive management if hematuria does not
   resolve with reversal of INR, ? urology procedure performed yesterday
   - f/u HCT Q8hrs
   - holding home doses of aspirin and coumadin
   - active T&S (1 unit still crossed)
   .
   #. [**Last Name (un) **] - Creatinine now back to 1.8 (baseline) from a high of 2.2.  [**Month (only) 60**]
   be due to hypovolemia vs. obstruction.  Renal ultrasound does not show
   obstruction but does show blood in the bladder.
   - follow urine output closely
   - CBI as above
   - Trend Cr
   .
   #UTI:  positive UA in the setting of gross blood but culture with no
   growth
   - Will discuss Antibiotics with urology given recent instrumentation
   .
   # CAD
 Slight increase in troponin from 0.02 to 0.04.  Patient is
   asymptomatic without chest pain and with no EKG changes. Likely that
   renal function is contributing factor.
   -hold aspirin and metoprolol for now, continue zocor
   - start beta blocker when blood pressure allows
   - f/u TTE
   - daily EKG for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient has received a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and has a hemoglobin level of 23.9%. The bleeding is likely due to the persistent hematuria, and the patient's condition may worsen if the bleeding is not controlled.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis and has undergone prosthetic aortic valve replacement. The recent increase in troponin levels (0.04) may indicate cardiac injury or infarction. The patient's cardiac enzymes should be closely monitored to assess for any further cardiac damage.
3. Renal complications: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis and has undergone prosthetic aortic valve replacement. The recent increase in creatinine levels (1.8) may indicate renal dysfunction or failure. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored to assess for any further decline.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis and has undergone prosthetic aortic valve replacement. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored to assess for any signs of respiratory failure or pulmonary edema.
5. Infection complications: The patient has a positive urine culture with no growth, which may indicate a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's antibiotics should be adjusted accordingly to prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the patient's gastrointestinal status should be closely monitored to assess for any signs of further bleeding or gastrointestinal obstruction.

   Assessment and Plan
   83y/o gentleman with a past medical history of aortic stenosis s/p
   prosthetic AVR, PAF on coumadin s/p TURP approximately 3 weeks ago who
   presented to the hospital with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU
   for hypotension in the setting of bleeding.
   .
   1. Hypotension: Most likely due to blood loss from persistent
   hematuria, however cardiac event is also a possiblity given acute
   nature.  ECG changes not worrisome for ACS.  Pt responded to fluids.
   Sepsis is less likely in this patient who does not have fevers or
   source of infection.  Risk of bleeding outweighs risk of embolic event
   and so INR reversal was recommended and completed.  Other etiologies
   include medications as pt has been receiving morphine boluses but this
   does not seem to correlate with timing of event.  Was also on
   Phenazopyridine for bladder spasms.
   - follow HCT q 8 hours and coags
   - continue with PRBC transfusion with goal HCT > 25
   - will monitor for pulmonary edema given history of aortic stenosis
   with valve replacement
   - Follow cardiac enzymes
   .
   2. Hematuria: s/p TURP 3 weeks ago.  Had Rouche catheter and 3 way
   CBI.  Unclear why he bleeding is occurring 3 weeks after procedure.
   Also occurred in the setting of INR of 3.1.
   - continue CBI
   - f/u urology recs for definitive management if hematuria does not
   resolve with reveral of INR, ? urology procedure performed yesterday
   - holding home doses of aspirin and coumadin
   - continue ceftriaxone for positive urinalysis
   - f/u urine culture
   - active T&S (1 unit still crossed)
   .
   3. [**Last Name (un) **] - Creatinine now back to 1.8 (baseline) from a high of 2.2.  [**Month (only) 60**]
   be due to hypovolemia vs. obstruction.  Renal ultrasound does not show
   obstruction but does show blood in the bladder.
   - follow urine output closely
   - CBI as above
   - Trend Cr

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a past medical history of aortic stenosis, prosthetic aortic valve replacement, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) on coumadin, who presented to the hospital with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of bleeding. He has received 9 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and has had a slight increase in troponin from 0.02 to 0.04. The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension, hematuria, and possible cardiac event. He is being managed with fluids, blood transfusions, and cardiac enzymes monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to blood loss from persistent hematuria, but cardiac event is also a possibility. The patient's INR was reversed due to the risk of bleeding outweighing the risk of embolic event.
2. Hematuria: The patient's hematuria is likely due to the recent TURP procedure, but the exact cause is unclear. The patient's INR was elevated at the time of bleeding, which may have contributed to the bleeding.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's slight increase in troponin may indicate cardiac damage, but he is asymptomatic and does not have EKG changes. The patient's renal function may be contributing to the troponin elevation.
4. Renal Complications: The patient's creatinine levels have increased, but his renal ultrasound does not show obstruction. The patient's blood in the bladder may be contributing to the increased creatinine levels.
5. Sepsis: The patient does not have fevers or a source of infection, making sepsis less likely.
6. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis with valve replacement, which increases his risk of pulmonary edema.
7. Bleeding Complications: The patient has received 9 units of pRBCs and has had a significant amount of blood transfused. He may be at risk for bleeding complications due to his low platelet count and elevated INR.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   83y/o gentleman with a past medical history of aortic stenosis s/p
   prosthetic AVR, PAF on coumadin s/p TURP approximately 3 weeks ago who
   presented to the hospital with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU
   for hypotension in the setting of bleeding.
   .
   1. Hypotension: Most likely due to blood loss from persistent
   hematuria, however cardiac event is also a possiblity given acute
   nature.  ECG changes not worrisome for ACS.  Pt responded to fluids.
   Sepsis is less likely in this patient who does not have fevers or
   source of infection.  Risk of bleeding outweighs risk of embolic event
   and so INR reversal was recommended and completed.  Other etiologies
   include medications as pt has been receiving morphine boluses but this
   does not seem to correlate with timing of event.  Was also on
   Phenazopyridine for bladder spasms.
   - follow HCT q 8 hours and coags
   - continue with PRBC transfusion with goal HCT > 25
   - will monitor for pulmonary edema given history of aortic stenosis
   with valve replacement
   - Follow cardiac enzymes
   .
   2. Hematuria: s/p TURP 3 weeks ago.  Had Rouche catheter and 3 way
   CBI.  Unclear why he bleeding is occurring 3 weeks after procedure.
   Also occurred in the setting of INR of 3.1.
   - continue CBI
   - f/u urology recs for definitive management if hematuria does not
   resolve with reveral of INR, ? urology procedure performed yesterday
   - holding home doses of aspirin and coumadin
   - continue ceftriaxone for positive urinalysis
   - f/u urine culture
   - active T&S (1 unit still crossed)
   .
   3. [**Last Name (un) **] - Creatinine now back to 1.8 (baseline) from a high of 2.2.  [**Month (only) 60**]
   be due to hypovolemia vs. obstruction.  Renal ultrasound does not show
   obstruction but does show blood in the bladder.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a past medical history of aortic stenosis, prosthetic aortic valve replacement, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and hematuria, likely due to blood loss from persistent bleeding. The patient received 9 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and has a current hemoglobin level of 23.9%. He also has a slight increase in troponin from 0.02 to 0.04, which may be attributed to renal function rather than cardiac issues. The patient has been prescribed various medications, including morphine, metoprolol, and warfarin, which have been adjusted or held due to his bleeding and cardiac conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient has received a significant amount of pRBCs and has a current hemoglobin level of 23.9%. Further bleeding complications may occur, particularly if the patient's INR is not adequately controlled.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis and PAF, and his troponin levels have increased slightly. Cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure, may occur if the patient's cardiac condition is not adequately managed.
3. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from 1.8 to 2.2, and his urine output is being closely monitored. Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, may occur if the patient's underlying kidney function is not adequately managed.
4. Infection complications: The patient has a urinary catheter in place and has received antibiotics for his positive urinalysis. Infection complications, such as urinary tract infection or sepsis, may occur if the patient's urinary catheter is not properly maintained or if his antibiotics are not effective.
5. Pulmonary edema: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis and may be at risk for pulmonary edema, particularly if his cardiac condition is not adequately managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels and adjust his transfusion therapy as necessary.
2. Continue to manage the patient's cardiac condition with medications and monitor his troponin levels closely.
3. Monitor the patient's urine output and adjust his fluid management as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's creatinine levels and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's temperature and white blood cell count closely to detect any signs of infection.
6. Consider consulting a cardiologist to further manage the patient's cardiac condition.
7. Consider consulting a nephrologist to further manage the patient's kidney function."

   Assessment and Plan
   83y/o gentleman with a past medical history of aortic stenosis s/p
   prosthetic AVR, PAF on coumadin s/p TURP approximately 3 weeks ago who
   presented to the hospital with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU
   for hypotension in the setting of bleeding.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Most likely due to blood loss from persistent
   hematuria, however cardiac event is also a possibility given acute
   nature.  ECG changes not worrisome for ACS.  Pt responded to fluids.
   Sepsis is less likely in this patient who does not have fevers or
   source of infection.  Risk of bleeding outweighs risk of embolic event
   and so INR reversal was recommended and completed.  Other etiologies
   include medications as pt has been receiving morphine boluses but this
   does not seem to correlate with timing of event.  Was also on
   Phenazopyridine for bladder spasms.
   - follow HCT Q8-12 hours and coags daily
   - continue with pRBC transfusion prn with goal HCT > 25
   - will monitor for pulmonary edema given history of aortic stenosis
   with valve replacement
   .
   #. Hematuria: s/p TURP 3 weeks ago.  Had Rouche catheter and 3 way
   CBI.  Unclear why bleeding is occurring 3 weeks after procedure.  Also
   occurred in the setting of INR of 3.1.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - continue CBI currently @ 1500 ml/hour
   - f/u urology recs, ? cystoscopy on Friday
   - f/u HCT Q8-12hrs and monitor for worsening hematuria
   - holding home doses of aspirin and coumadin
   - active T&S
   .
   #. [**Last Name (un) **] - Creatinine now back to 1.8 (baseline) from a high of 2.2.  [**Month (only) 60**]
   be due to hypovolemia vs. obstruction.  Renal ultrasound does not show
   obstruction but does show blood in the bladder.
   - follow urine output closely
   - CBI as above
   - Trend Cr
   .
   #UTI:  positive UA in the setting of gross blood but culture with no
   growth. Discussed with urology, who favors antibiotic coverage at this
   time given recent instrumentation
   - continue ciprofloxacin, will discuss course of therapy with urology
   .
   # CAD
 Slight increase in troponin from 0.02 to 0.04.  Patient is
   asymptomatic without chest pain and with no EKG changes. Likely that
   renal function is contributing factor.  TTE without regional wall
   motion abnormalities.
   -hold aspirin and metoprolol for now, continue zocor
   - start beta blocker when blood pressure allows
   .
   # PAF - continue amiodarone, hold metoprolol for acute bleed
   - hold digoxin for rate control
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia - continue zocor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a past medical history of aortic stenosis, prosthetic AVR, and PAF on coumadin, who presented to the hospital with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of bleeding.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a hemodynamic monitoring showing a Tmax of 36.9°C, Tcurrent of 36.9°C, HR of 66 bpm, BP of 134/50 mmHg, RR of 13 inspirations per minute, and SpO2 of 92%. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with no acute distress, and the only notable finding is a III/VI holosystolic murmur on cardiovascular examination.

The patient has received several medications, including metoprolol, morphine sulfate, omeprazole, and ceftriaxone. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.0 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, and platelet count of 164 x 10^9/L.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to blood loss from persistent hematuria, and the risk of bleeding outweighs the risk of embolic event.
2. Hematuria: The patient's hematuria is likely due to the recent TURP procedure, and the patient will be monitored for worsening hematuria and follow-up with urology.
3. [Last Name (un)]: The patient's creatinine has returned to baseline, and the patient will be followed closely for urine output and trended for creatinine.
4. UTI: The patient has a positive UA, and antibiotic coverage has been initiated.
5. CAD: The patient has a slight increase in troponin, but is asymptomatic and without EKG changes. The patient will be held on aspirin and metoprolol for now, and will be started on beta blockers when blood pressure allows.
6. PAF: The patient will continue on amiodarone and hold metoprolol for acute bleed.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient will continue on zocor.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to the recent instrumentation and potential UTI.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis and valve replacement, and is at risk for pulmonary edema.
3. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to the recent TURP procedure and anticoagulation therapy.
4. Renal failure: The patient is at risk for renal failure due to hypovolemia and potential obstruction.
5. Cardiac events: The patient has a history of CAD and is at risk for cardiac events, including myocardial infarction and arrhythmias.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the patient should be closely monitored for any changes in vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status."

   Assessment and Plan
   83y/o gentleman with a past medical history of aortic stenosis s/p
   prosthetic AVR, PAF on coumadin s/p TURP approximately 3 weeks ago who
   presented to the hospital with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU
   for hypotension in the setting of bleeding.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Most likely due to blood loss from persistent
   hematuria, however cardiac event is also a possibility given acute
   nature.  ECG changes not worrisome for ACS.  Pt responded to fluids.
   Sepsis is less likely in this patient who does not have fevers or
   source of infection.  Risk of bleeding outweighs risk of embolic event
   and so INR reversal was recommended and completed.  Other etiologies
   include medications as pt has been receiving morphine boluses but this
   does not seem to correlate with timing of event.  Was also on
   Phenazopyridine for bladder spasms.
   - follow HCT [**Hospital1 **] and coags daily
   - continue with pRBC transfusion prn with goal HCT > 25
   - will monitor for pulmonary edema given history of aortic stenosis
   with valve replacement
   - Follow cardiac enzymes
   .
   #. Hematuria: s/p TURP 3 weeks ago.  Had Rouche catheter and 3 way
   CBI.  Unclear why bleeding is occurring 3 weeks after procedure.  Also
   occurred in the setting of INR of 3.1.
   - continue CBI currently @ 1500 ml/hour
   - f/u urology recs, ? cystoscopy on Friday
   - f/u HCT [**Hospital1 **] and monitor for worsening hematuria
   - holding home doses of aspirin and coumadin
   - active T&S
   .
   #. [**Last Name (un) **] - Creatinine now back to 1.8 (baseline) from a high of 2.2.  [**Month (only) 60**]
   be due to hypovolemia vs. obstruction.  Renal ultrasound does not show
   obstruction but does show blood in the bladder.
   - follow urine output closely
   - CBI as above
   - Trend Cr
   .
   #UTI:  positive UA in the setting of gross blood but culture with no
   growth
   - Will discuss Antibiotics with urology given recent instrumentation
   .
   # CAD
 Slight increase in troponin from 0.02 to 0.04.  Patient is
   asymptomatic without chest pain and with no EKG changes. Likely that
   renal function is contributing factor.
   -hold aspirin and metoprolol for now, continue zocor
   - start beta blocker when blood pressure allows
   - f/u TTE
   - daily EKG for now
   .
   # PAF - continue amiodarone, hold metoprolol for acute bleed
   - hold digoxin for rate control

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   83y/o gentleman with a past medical history of aortic stenosis s/p
   prosthetic AVR, PAF on coumadin s/p TURP approximately 3 weeks ago who
   presented to the hospital with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU
   for hypotension in the setting of bleeding.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Most likely due to blood loss from persistent
   hematuria, however cardiac event is also a possibility given acute
   nature.  ECG changes not worrisome for ACS.  Pt responded to fluids.
   Sepsis is less likely in this patient who does not have fevers or
   source of infection.  Risk of bleeding outweighs risk of embolic event
   and so INR reversal was recommended and completed.  Other etiologies
   include medications as pt has been receiving morphine boluses but this
   does not seem to correlate with timing of event.  Was also on
   Phenazopyridine for bladder spasms.
   - follow HCT [**Hospital1 **] and coags daily
   - continue with pRBC transfusion prn with goal HCT > 25
   - will monitor for pulmonary edema given history of aortic stenosis
   with valve replacement
   - Follow cardiac enzymes
   .
   #. Hematuria: s/p TURP 3 weeks ago.  Had Rouche catheter and 3 way
   CBI.  Unclear why bleeding is occurring 3 weeks after procedure.  Also
   occurred in the setting of INR of 3.1.
   - continue CBI currently @ 1500 ml/hour
   - f/u urology recs, ? cystoscopy on Friday
   - f/u HCT [**Hospital1 **] and monitor for worsening hematuria
   - holding home doses of aspirin and coumadin
   - active T&S
   .
   #. [**Last Name (un) **] - Creatinine now back to 1.8 (baseline) from a high of 2.2.  [**Month (only) 60**]
   be due to hypovolemia vs. obstruction.  Renal ultrasound does not show
   obstruction but does show blood in the bladder.
   - follow urine output closely
   - CBI as above
   - Trend Cr
   .
   #UTI:  positive UA in the setting of gross blood but culture with no
   growth
   - Will discuss Antibiotics with urology given recent instrumentation
   .
   # CAD
 Slight increase in troponin from 0.02 to 0.04.  Patient is
   asymptomatic without chest pain and with no EKG changes. Likely that
   renal function is contributing factor.
   -hold aspirin and metoprolol for now, continue zocor
   - start beta blocker when blood pressure allows
   - f/u TTE
   - daily EKG for now
   .
   # PAF - continue amiodarone, hold metoprolol for acute bleed
   - hold digoxin for rate control
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia - continue zocor
   .
   # FEN
 IVF boluses as needed, replete electrolytes, Cardiac/Hearth
   Healthy Diet.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a past medical history of aortic stenosis, prosthetic aortic valve replacement, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of bleeding after a transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) procedure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.9°C, Tcurrent 36.9°C, HR 66 bpm, BP 134/50 mmHg, RR 13 inspirations per minute, SpO2 92%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Normal sinus rhythm, cardiac enzymes within normal limits
* Fluid balance: Positive fluid balance of 1,955 mL over the past 24 hours
* Respiratory support: No oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation
* Laboratory results: WBC 10.0 x 10^9/L, Hct 27.5%, Plt 164 x 10^9/L, Cr 1.8 mg/dL, TropT 0.04 ng/mL, TCO2 27 mmHg, Glucose 158 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and complications include:

* Hypotension: Due to blood loss from persistent hematuria, cardiac event, or medication side effects. The patient responded to fluids and has been restarted on metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID.
* Hematuria: S/p TURP 3 weeks ago, with unclear reasons for bleeding. The patient is being monitored for worsening hematuria and is scheduled for a cystoscopy on Friday.
* Renal function: The patient's creatinine has increased from 1.8 to 2.2 mg/dL, but has since returned to baseline. A renal ultrasound showed blood in the bladder but no obstruction.
* UTI: The patient has a positive urine culture with no growth, but is being treated for a possible UTI.
* CAD: The patient has a slight increase in troponin from 0.02 to 0.04 ng/mL, but is asymptomatic and has no EKG changes.
* PAF: The patient is being continued on amiodarone and has had his metoprolol held for the acute bleed.
* Hyperlipidemia: The patient is being continued on zocor.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac complications: Prolonged hypotension, cardiac tamponade, or acute coronary syndrome
* Renal complications: Acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or end-stage renal disease
* Respiratory complications: Pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or respiratory failure
* Infection complications: Sepsis, urinary tract infection, or other infections
* Bleeding complications: Hemorrhagic shock, bleeding diathesis, or gastrointestinal bleeding

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, and laboratory results
* Fluid management and blood transfusion as needed
* Antibiotic therapy for UTI
* Cardiovascular medications, including beta blockers and aspirin
* Dietary recommendations for hyperlipidemia
* Renal function monitoring and possible further evaluation
* Cystoscopy on Friday to evaluate hematuria
* Daily EKG and TTE to monitor cardiac function

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and his disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   83y/o gentleman with a past medical history of aortic stenosis s/p
   prosthetic AVR, PAF on coumadin s/p TURP approximately 3 weeks ago who
   presented to the hospital with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU
   for hypotension in the setting of bleeding.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Most likely due to blood loss from persistent
   hematuria, however cardiac event is also a possibility given acute
   nature.  ECG changes not worrisome for ACS.  Pt responded to fluids.
   Sepsis is less likely in this patient who does not have fevers or
   source of infection.  Risk of bleeding outweighs risk of embolic event
   and so INR reversal was recommended and completed.  Other etiologies
   include medications as pt has been receiving morphine boluses but this
   does not seem to correlate with timing of event.  Was also on
   Phenazopyridine for bladder spasms.
   - follow HCT [**Hospital1 **] and coags daily
   - continue with pRBC transfusion prn with goal HCT > 25
   - will monitor for pulmonary edema given history of aortic stenosis
   with valve replacement
   - Follow cardiac enzymes
   .
   #. Hematuria: s/p TURP 3 weeks ago.  Had Rouche catheter and 3 way
   CBI.  Unclear why bleeding is occurring 3 weeks after procedure.  Also
   occurred in the setting of INR of 3.1.
   - continue CBI currently @ 1500 ml/hour
   - f/u urology recs, ? cystoscopy on Friday
   - f/u HCT [**Hospital1 **] and monitor for worsening hematuria
   - holding home doses of aspirin and coumadin
   - active T&S
   .
   #. [**Last Name (un) **] - Creatinine now back to 1.8 (baseline) from a high of 2.2.  [**Month (only) 60**]
   be due to hypovolemia vs. obstruction.  Renal ultrasound does not show
   obstruction but does show blood in the bladder.
   - follow urine output closely
   - CBI as above
   - Trend Cr
   .
   #UTI:  positive UA in the setting of gross blood but culture with no
   growth
   - Will discuss Antibiotics with urology given recent instrumentation
   .
   # CAD
 Slight increase in troponin from 0.02 to 0.04.  Patient is
   asymptomatic without chest pain and with no EKG changes. Likely that
   renal function is contributing factor.
   -hold aspirin and metoprolol for now, continue zocor
   - start beta blocker when blood pressure allows
   - f/u TTE
   - daily EKG for now
   .
   # PAF - continue amiodarone, hold metoprolol for acute bleed
   - hold digoxin for rate control
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia - continue zocor
   .
   # FEN
 IVF boluses as needed, replete electrolytes, Cardiac/Hearth
   Healthy Diet.

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a past medical history of aortic stenosis, prosthetic aortic valve replacement, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). He presented to the hospital with hematuria and was transferred to the ICU for hypotension in the setting of bleeding. He has been receiving various medications, including metoprolol, morphine, and omeprazole. His laboratory results show moderate mitral stenosis, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. He has had two episodes of clot obstructing the cystostomy bag (CBI), which were able to be flushed and restarted.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding is ongoing, and he is at risk for further bleeding complications, particularly given his history of aortic stenosis and prosthetic valve replacement.
2. Sepsis: The patient's temperature is normal, but he has a history of instrumentation and may be at risk for sepsis.
3. Pulmonary Edema: Given the patient's history of aortic stenosis and valve replacement, he is at risk for pulmonary edema, particularly if he develops heart failure.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's troponin levels have increased slightly, and he may be at risk for cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Renal Complications: The patient's creatinine levels have decreased, but he may still be at risk for renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. UTI: The patient's urine culture is positive, and he may be at risk for a urinary tract infection.
7. Cystoscopy Complications: The patient is scheduled for cystoscopy on Friday, and he may be at risk for complications related to the procedure, such as bleeding or infection.
8. PAF: The patient's PAF is being managed with amiodarone, but he may still be at risk for cardiac complications related to his arrhythmia."
