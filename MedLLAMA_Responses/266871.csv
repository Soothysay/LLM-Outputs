   Assessment and Plan
   67 year old gentleman with h/o ischemic cardiomyopathy EF 20%,
   Refractory VT s/p ablation, CAD s/p MI'[**03**], who presented from rehab
   with increasing SOB c/w acute on chronic heart failure.
   .
   #PUMP/ CHF exacerbation: CXR with effusions (right >left) and left
   likely loculated fluid per CT.  Patient has clinically improved and has
   diuresed >4L in past 24hrs.  Patient has been off lasix gtt and has
   continued diurese 1L since.  Patient continues to have mild bilateral
   basilar crackles, improved from yesterday.
   Poor EF of 20% with ischemic cardiomayopathy.  SBPs in 90-114 range now
   so relatively low flow state continues.
   - Goal negative 1L over 24hrs.  Will hold on Lasix for now, will
   restart if necessary
   -continue 1 L fluid restriction
   - Hold Metoprolol given low BP
   .
   # Rhythm: Patient has a history of refractory VT s/p ablation on recent
   admission (after sepsis) and hx of a-fib ablation too.  Currently V
   paced with occasional PVCs.
   - Continue Mexilitine 200mg PO Q8
   - Continue Amiodarone 200mg PO Q8
   .
   #CAD-
   - Holding BB
   -Continue statin
   -consider restart ASA prior to d/c (later)
   .
   # Dyspnea : improving, oxygen saturations are 96-97% on 2L.  CHF
   exacerbation and pleural effusion contributing to SOB. CT Chest shows
   large right effusion and loculated small left effusion.   As patient is
   stable, can wait for INR to trend downward.
   -plan for thoracentesis of R sided effusion over next 24hrs once INR
   down to 1.4-1.5 range
   -cont to hold Lovenox
   .
   AMS- Resolved.  Patient AO x3 this AM.  Avoid any benzos, morphine or
   Ambien for now.  Lyrica has been discontinued as this may be resulting
   in worsening of mental status.  .
   .
   #Constipation: Patient reported constipation on admission which has
   since resolved. Hx of short gut syndrome.
   - Psyllum Wafers
   - Continue [**Name (NI) 1267**], [**Name (NI) **], MOM
   - continue cholestyramine
   .
   #CRI : Patient has a history of CRI, currently Cr 2.2 and BUN 81 (Cr up
   from  baseline 1.6-1.8)
   -increase Dobutamine as above to improve perfusion to kidneys
   -reprogram pacemaker with increased HR to 70bpm for better CO
   -monitor Cr/BUN
   -f/u pm lytes while diuresing
   -f/up Fe-Urea calculations once pending urine lytes return.
   -Renal consult for uremia concerns and rising BUN/Cr
   .
   #Hyperphosphatemia- likely a consequence of his CKD which is probably
   underestimated by his creatinine in the setting of cachexia. Repleted
   today
   .
   #DMII: Will continue home dose NPH, ISS
   .
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has a history of leukocytosis as a consequence
   of MDS. Afebrile. UA showed no infection, no dysuria now. No cough or
   URI sx despite effusions on CT. F/up urine culture, final blood
   cultures
   .
   # Hypercoagulability Disorder: Holding Lovenox while awaiting INR
   decrease for thoracentesis, continue heparin gtt
   .
   #Depression: Continue Citalopram 40mg PO Qday, consider psych consult
   once stabilizes/less lethargic. SW Consult to address family/patient

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF of 20%, refractory VT ablation, CAD s/p MI, and a history of chronic heart failure. He presented to the ICU with symptoms of SOB and acute CHF.

The patient's current condition is stable, with improved diuresis (>4L in the past 24 hours) and decreased bilateral basilar crackles. His blood pressure is in the range of 90-114 mmHg, indicating a relatively low flow state. The patient is currently V-paced with occasional PVCs.

The patient has a history of refractory VT, a-fib ablation, and CAD, and is being treated with medications such as Mexilitine, Amiodarone, and statin. He is also being managed for CHF exacerbation, pleural effusion, and hypercoagulability disorder.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 20.2-20.9 K/uL
* Hct: 37.5%
* Plt: 336-371 K/uL
* Cr: 1.9-2.2 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.38 ng/mL
* Glucose: 85-86 mg/dL

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 36.6 C (97.8 F)
* Tcurrent: 36.2 C (97.1 F)
* HR: 60-81 bpm
* BP: 112/65-113/75 mmHg
* RR: 12-17 insp/min
* SpO2: 96%

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of CHF exacerbation, leading to increased fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
2. Development of arrhythmias, including VT, atrial fibrillation, or ventricular fibrillation.
3. Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy and platelet dysfunction.
4. Hyperphosphatemia, which may worsen kidney function and increase the risk of cardiovascular events.
5. Leukocytosis, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process.
6. Depression, which may impact the patient's quality of life and increase the risk of adverse outcomes.
7. Constipation, which may worsen the patient's overall comfort and increase the risk of complications.
8. Hypercoagulability disorder, which may increase the risk of thromboembolic events.
9. Cachexia, which may worsen the patient's overall condition and increase the risk of complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and laboratory results, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition closely to identify any potential complications and adjust his management plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation, and coronary artery disease (CAD) after myocardial infarction (MI). He was admitted with symptoms of shortness of breath (SOB) and acute heart failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T-max 36.6°C (97.8°F), T-current 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate 60 bpm, blood pressure 112/65 mmHg, respiratory rate 12 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is V-paced with occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,096 mL of fluids and has lost 5,130 mL of fluids through urine and stool.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula.
* Physical examination: The patient is cachectic, fatigued, and has bilateral lower lobe rales and decreased sounds on the right side.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 20.2-20.9 K/μL
* Hematocrit: 37.7-37.5%
* Platelet count: 371-336 K/μL
* Creatinine: 1.9-2.2 mg/dL
* Troponin: 0.38 ng/mL
* Glucose: 85-86 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Heart failure: The patient has a poor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20% and has experienced a recent exacerbation of heart failure. He is at risk for further decompensation.
* Ventricular tachycardia: The patient has a history of refractory VT and is currently V-paced.
* Coronary artery disease: The patient has CAD and is at risk for further myocardial infarction.
* Chronic kidney disease: The patient has CKD and is at risk for further decline in kidney function.
* Hyperphosphatemia: The patient has hyperphosphatemia, which may contribute to his CKD.
* Depression: The patient is taking citalopram and is at risk for further depression.
* Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be a consequence of his myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Diuretic therapy: The patient is receiving lasix and will continue to receive diuretics as needed.
* Vasopressor therapy: The patient is receiving dobutamine and will continue to receive vasopressors as needed.
* Anticoagulation therapy: The patient is receiving heparin and will continue to receive anticoagulation therapy as needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following is a summary of the patient's health status and potential medical complications:

**Patient's Current Status:**

* The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF of 20%, refractory VT ablation, and CAD s/p MI.
* He presented with SOB and acute CHF, which has clinically improved with diuresis of >4L in the past 24 hours.
* He is currently V-paced with occasional PVCs.
* His vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 36.6°C, Tcurrent of 36.2°C, HR of 60 bpm, BP of 112/65 mmHg, RR of 12 insp/min, and SpO2 of 96%.
* He has mild bilateral basilar crackles and is on a fluid restriction of 1L/day.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **CHF Exacerbation:** The patient's EF of 20% and history of ischemic cardiomyopathy make him prone to CHF exacerbation. The patient's current fluid restriction and diuresis plan aim to prevent further fluid accumulation.
2. **Rhythm Disturbances:** The patient's history of refractory VT and a-fib ablation increases his risk of rhythm disturbances. The patient is currently V-paced, and his PVCs are being monitored.
3. **CAD:** The patient's history of CAD and recent MI increase his risk of CAD progression. The patient is currently on a statin and may need to restart ASA prior to discharge.
4. **Pleural Effusion:** The patient has a large right-sided pleural effusion and a loculated small left-sided effusion, which may require thoracentesis.
5. **Hypercoagulability Disorder:** The patient's history of hypercoagulability disorder increases his risk of thrombotic events. He is currently on heparin gtt and Lovenox is being held until his INR decreases.
6. **CKD:** The patient's history of CKD increases his risk of hyperphosphatemia, which is currently being monitored.
7. **MDS:** The patient's history of MDS increases his risk of leukocytosis, which is currently being monitored.
8. **Depression:** The patient has a history of depression and is currently on Citalopram. He may require a psych consult once he is more stable.

**Plan:**

* Continue diuresis and fluid restriction to manage CHF exacerbation.
* Monitor the patient's rhythm and adjust his medication as needed.
* Consider restarting ASA prior to discharge.
* Plan for thoracentesis of the right-sided pleural effusion once his INR decreases.
* Continue heparin gtt and monitor the patient's INR.
* Monitor the patient's CKD and hyperphosphatemia.
* Continue to monitor the patient's MDS and leukocytosis.
* Consider a psych consult once the patient is more stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF of 20%, refractory VT ablation, CAD s/p MI, and chronic heart failure. He presented with increasing shortness of breath, which was exacerbated by a recent acute on chronic heart failure episode. He has a poor EF, and his blood pressure is in the range of 90-114 mmHg, indicating a low flow state. He has a history of refractory VT, and his current rhythm is V-paced with occasional PVCs.

The patient's laboratory results show worsening renal function, with a creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL and BUN of 81 mg/dL. He has a history of CRI, and his current Cr and BUN are concerning. His electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with hyperphosphatemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral basilar crackles, JVD 12-13 cm, and peripheral edema, consistent with volume overload. He has a history of constipation and is currently constipated.

Assessment and Plan:

1. #PUMP/CHF exacerbation: Increase Dobutamine drip to 7.5mcg/hr to improve cardiac output and avoid hypoperfusion.
2. #Rhythm: Increase pacemaker rate to 70bpm to improve cardiac output and consider re-programming to a higher rate.
3. #CAD: Hold beta-blockers and consider restarting ASA prior to discharge.
4. #Dyspnea: Plan for thoracentesis of right-sided effusion over the next 48 hours once INR is down to 1.4-1.5 range.
5. #AMS: Decrease Oxycodone dose to 10mg q12hrs and avoid benzos, morphine, or Ambien.
6. #Constipation: Continue Psyllium Wafers, cholestyramine, and MOM.
7. #CRI: Increase Dobutamine to improve perfusion to kidneys, reprogram pacemaker to 70bpm, and monitor Cr/BUN.
8. #Hyperphosphatemia: Replenish phosphorus levels.
9. #DMII: Continue home dose NPH and ISS.
10. #Leukocytosis: Follow up urine culture and final blood cultures.
11. #Hypercoagulability Disorder: Hold Lovenox and continue heparin gtt.
12. #Depression: Continue Citalopram 40mg PO Qday and consider psych consult once patient stabilizes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: Cardiac tamponade, cardiac arrest, or worsening heart failure due to refractory VT and poor EF.
2. Renal complications: Acute kidney injury, worsening renal function, or uremia due to CRI and hyperphosphatemia.
3. Respiratory complications: Pneumonia, respiratory failure, or worsening respiratory distress due to pleural effusions and respiratory failure.
4. Infectious complications: Sepsis, pneumonia, or urinary tract infection due to catheter-related infections or pleural effusions.
5. Neurological complications: Worsening mental status, delirium, or seizures due to AMS, hyperphosphatemia, or electrolyte imbalances.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: Constipation, bowel obstruction, or gastrointestinal bleeding due to constipation and impaired gut motility.
7. Hematological complications: Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia due to CRI, leukocytosis, or bone marrow suppression.
8. Endocrine complications: Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to DMII and impaired glucose regulation.
9. Nutritional complications: Malnutrition, dehydration, or electrolyte imbalances due to impaired nutrient absorption, inadequate nutrition, or excessive fluid losses."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy, EF of 20%, refractory VT ablation, and CAD s/p MI. He presented with SOB and acute CHF. His 24-hour events include episodes of VT, increased dobutamine dose, and subsequent turn-off. He was diuresed well, and his lasix gtt was turned off. A renal consultation was performed.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.2°C (97.1°F)
* HR: 60 (60-81) bpm
* BP: 112/65 (76) mmHg
* RR: 12 (8-17) inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 96%
* Heart rhythm: V-paced

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Cachectic male, fatigued appearing, conversing in full sentences
* Neck: JVP 10cm
* Pulm: Rales in bilateral lower lobes, decreased sounds on right
* Cards: S1 & S2 regular without murmur
* Abd: Soft, mildly distended, tympanitic, non-tender, no rebound/guarding
* Ext: B upper extremity edema. R BKA, stump with no open wounds or erythema. Wound on L foot, healing well. 1+ DP on L foot.
* Neuro: AAO x3

Laboratory results include:

* WBC: 20.2-20.9 K/uL
* Hct: 37.7-37.5%
* Plt: 371-336 K/uL
* Cr: 1.9-2.2 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.38 ng/mL
* Glucose: 85-86 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 18.2/61.4/1.7, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 36/0.38/0.38, Lactic Acid: 0.9 mmol/L, Ca++: 7.7 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 6.3 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Increase dobutamine drip to 7.5mcg/hr to avoid hypoperfusion
* Pressor/dobutamine for BP control
* Lasix gtt down to 5mg/hour
* Goal negative 1L over 24hrs
* Continue 1L fluid restriction
* Hold Metoprolol due to low BP
* Cath in place now, strict I/Os
* D/c Lyrica due to potential for edema/fluid retention state
* Plan to increase pacemaker rate/re-program to 70bpm for better cardiac output
* Continue Mexilitine 200mg PO Q8
* Continue Amiodarone 200mg PO Q8
* Hold BB
* Continue statin
* Consider restart ASA prior to discharge

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* CHF exacerbation with worsening cardiac output and increasing BPs
* Hypoperfusion due to low EF and potential for renal insufficiency
* Hyperphosphatemia due to CKD and potential for further worsening
* Leukocytosis due to MDS and potential for infection
* Hypercoagulability disorder due to CKD and potential for thrombotic events
* Depression due to chronic illness and potential for worsening mental status
* Constipation due to short gut syndrome and potential for further worsening
* CRI due to CKD and potential for further worsening
* Uremia due to CKD and potential for further worsening
* Hyperglycemia due to DMII and potential for further worsening

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, refractory ventricular tachycardia, and coronary artery disease. He presented to the hospital with worsening shortness of breath and was diagnosed with acute on chronic heart failure. He underwent thoracentesis, which resulted in the removal of 2.1L of serous fluid, and was found to have bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient is currently being treated with furosemide, metoprolol, and heparin, and is being monitored for signs of heart failure, respiratory distress, and bleeding. He is also being treated for hyperphosphatemia, leukocytosis, and hypercoagulability disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of refractory ventricular tachycardia and acute on chronic heart failure puts him at risk for cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's bilateral pleural effusions and respiratory failure put him at risk for respiratory distress.
3. Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding while on lovenox and ASA puts him at risk for bleeding complications.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and hypercoagulability disorder put him at risk for infection.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and current treatment with furosemide put him at risk for renal failure.
6. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient's history of hyperphosphatemia and current treatment with furosemide put him at risk for further complications.
7. Depression: The patient's history of depression and current treatment with citalopram put him at risk for depression.
8. Diarrhea: The patient's history of diarrhea and current treatment with colace put him at risk for further complications.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's current treatment plan includes furosemide, metoprolol, and heparin, and he is being monitored for signs of heart failure, respiratory distress, and bleeding. He is also being treated for hyperphosphatemia, leukocytosis, and hypercoagulability disorder.

The patient will be continued on his current treatment plan and will be monitored closely for any signs of complications. He will also be followed up with a cardiologist and a nephrologist to manage his chronic kidney disease and hyperphosphatemia.

It is recommended that the patient be continued on his current treatment plan and that he be monitored closely for any signs of complications."
