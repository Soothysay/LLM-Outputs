   Assessment and Plan
   45F with breast cancer with mets to bone and liver presenting with
   dysphagia and hypotension
   .
   #.  Hypotension. Likely dehydration in setting of poor PO intake with
   dysphagia, hypercalcemia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and
   hyponatremia.  Also on ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's
   immunocompromised state, PE, splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD,
   bleeding unlikely given stable to elevated hematocrit.  Pt now s/p 5.5L
   IVF and BP stable with MAPs in the 60
s-70
   - Continue IVF boluses as needed for MAP<60, although patient is likely
   third spacing IVF with such a low albumin
   - F/u blood, urine cultures
   - Started on Vanc/Zosyn last night after no clinical improvement from
   IVF boluses
   - Hold diuresis for now
   - Likely contributed to by hypovolemic hyponatremia second to third
   spacing
   .
   #.  Altered mental status: Likely from dilaudid use and hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Feel that less likely is hypoperfusion from
   hypotension,  infection, less likely hypercalcemia or brain metastases.
   -hold dilaudid for now, if needed, use 0.25mg doses
   -adjunct pain medication with topical lidocaine/maalox/diphenhydramine
   rinse
   -Narcan if concern for respiratory status
   - f/u cultures
    -lactulose, although patient has been unable to take
   .
   #.  Dysphagia - pt immunocopromised on chemo and steroids, also with
   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush, making
   esophageal candidiasis most likely, also on ddx includes viral
   esophagitis (CMV, HSV).  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest not
   showing bulky disease in chest, and would be less likely to cause pain.
   -rx for now for candidal esophagitis with fluconazole 200mg daily for
   14-21 days.
   -check CMV Ab and VL, HSV Ab
   -Consider GI c/s for scope if no improvement in 72 hours.
   .
   #.  Hypercalcemia.  A recurrent problem for this patient with widely
   metastatic cancer. Corrected ca = 11.6, only mildly elevated for this
   patient, who has been admitted with ca as high as 19 in the past.
   -Hydrate as above
   -continue to monitor
   .
   #.  Liver failure - Pt with known extensive liver mets.  No evidence of
   biliary obstruction on ultrasound
   -f/u final read u/s

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   #.  Hypotension. Likely dehydration in setting of poor PO intake with
   dysphagia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and hyponatremia.  Also on
   ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's immunocompromised state, PE,
   splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD, bleeding unlikely given stable
   to elevated hematocrit.  Pt now s/p 5.5L IVF and BP stable with MAPs in
   the 60

   - Continue IVF boluses as needed for MAP<60, although patient is likely
   third spacing IVF with such a low albumin.  Will give sodium bicarb in
   fluid if needs further fluid resuscitation
   - F/u blood, urine cultures
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for now but may not need antibiotics if
   clinically improves and cultures negative, sepsis less likely at this

   - TTE today to assess for pericardial effusion in setting of low
   voltage on ECG, hypotension, metastatic cancer
   - Can consider albumin to help keep fluids intravascularly

   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush, making
   esophageal candidiasis most likely, also on ddx includes viral
   esophagitis (CMV, HSV).  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest not

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to dehydration, diuretic use, and poor PO intake. It is essential to continue IV fluids and monitor the patient's blood pressure closely.
2. Infection/Sepsis: The patient's immunocompromised state and poor wound healing make her susceptible to infection. Blood and urine cultures should be monitored closely, and antibiotics should be continued if cultures are positive.
3. Liver Failure: The patient has known liver metastases, and her lab results show elevated LFTs and T Bili. It is essential to monitor her liver function and consider liver transplant if necessary.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated coagulation studies suggest liver failure. DIC labs should be sent, and the patient should be evaluated for possible contribution of lovenox and whether she is on the correct dose.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient has a history of hypercalcemia, and it is essential to continue monitoring her calcium levels and consider treatment if necessary.
6. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobility and cancer. Lovenox should be continued as prophylaxis.
7. Respiratory Failure: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory rate suggest possible respiratory failure. Close monitoring of her respiratory status is essential.
8. GI Bleeding: The patient's dysphagia and esophageal candidiasis make her susceptible to GI bleeding. Close monitoring of her GI status is essential.

Plan:

1. Continue IV fluids and monitor the patient's blood pressure closely.
2. Monitor blood and urine cultures and continue antibiotics if cultures are positive.
3. Monitor the patient's liver function and consider liver transplant if necessary.
4. Send DIC labs and evaluate possible contribution of lovenox and whether she is on the correct dose.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's calcium levels and consider treatment if necessary.
6. Continue Lovenox as prophylaxis for DVT.
7. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
8. Consider GI c/s for scope if no improvement in 72 hours.
9. Hold diuretics for now and consider aggressive nutrition and lactulose for liver failure.
10. Consider stress dose steroids and TSH level to evaluate for adrenal insufficiency."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with metastatic breast cancer who has extensive metastatic
   disease with substantial liver involvement and compromised hepatic
   function who has come in with significant hypotension in the setting of
   dilaudid Rx for significant pain from esophagitis and mucositis
   presumed.  This, in the setting of significant compromise of hepatic
   function may well have contributed to persistent and significant
   altered mental status acros time.  Mental status has improved as
   dilaudid had been metabolized.  The hyptension has persisted and is
   within the range of where patient has been documented to be recently at
   home.  This is with improved mental status this morning.  She has
   persistent hypotension through to this morning but without obvious
   source for acute worsening of stability.  Investigation of the primary
   issue would suggest--preload has been repleted, sources of vasodilatory
   insult including adrenal failure, hypthyroidism and sepsis appear less
   likely.  We have the persistent and resting tacycardia likely
   represents cardiac compromise and does raise concern for possible
   compromise SV.  The issue may be patient with continued loss of
   intravascular volume.
   1)Hypotension-
   -Will have to evaluate ECHO today
   -Will have to fluid bolus as needed
   -Will need to finalize any culture results in regards to bacterial
   infection but do not have clear evidcence of it.
   -If ECHO reassuring will need to consider
intravascular volume
   depletion + effects of narcotics as most likely cause for hypotension
   and manage appropriately going forward
   2)Altered Mental Status-Much improved today with patient alert,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer, extensive metastatic disease, and compromised hepatic function. She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 35.7°C (96.2°F)
* Heart rate: 125 bpm
* Blood pressure: 94/68 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 32 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 14.1 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.7 K/uL
* Platelet count: 150 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 90 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 18.0/150.0/1.6, ALT/AST: 228/248, Alk Phos/T Bili: 776/16.8, etc.

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Head, ears, nose, and throat: Normocephalic
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and distant S2
* Peripheral vascular: Right radial pulse not assessed, Left radial pulse not assessed, etc.
* Respiratory/chest: Symmetric expansion, dull percussion, and diminished breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, distended, and non-tender
* Extremities: Right lower extremity edema 3+, Left lower extremity edema 3+
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Not attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, etc.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has persisted, and the source is unclear. The plan is to evaluate the patient with an echocardiogram, fluid bolus as needed, and finalize culture results. If the echocardiogram is reassuring, the patient may have continued loss of intravascular volume and effects of narcotics as the most likely cause of hypotension.
* Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has improved with the metabolization of Dilaudid, and she is now alert, interactive, and responsive. The plan is to use lactulose and careful use of narcotics.
* Mucositis: The patient has esophagitis and mucositis, and the plan is to use local therapy for control and narcotics PRN only.
* Renal failure, acute: The patient has acute renal failure, and the plan is to manage it accordingly.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac compromise: The patient's persistent tachycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiac compromise, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
* Intravascular volume depletion: The patient's hypotension may be caused by continued loss of intravascular volume, which could lead to further compromise of her already compromised hepatic function.
* Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and hypotension could be indicative of sepsis, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and tachypnea could worsen if not managed promptly, leading to respiratory failure.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's esophagitis and mucositis could lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which could worsen if not managed promptly.
* Renal failure progression: The patient's acute renal failure could worsen if not managed promptly, leading to further compromise of her overall health."

 .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), BREAST
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   45F with breast cancer with mets to bone and liver presenting with
   dysphagia and hypotension
   #.  Dysphagia - Pt immunocopromised on chemo and steroids, also with
   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush,
   however positive for CMV.  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest
   not showing bulky disease in chest, and would be less likely to cause
   pain.
   -rx for now for candidal esophagitis with fluconazole 200mg daily for
   14-21 days given thrush on exam, now also on Ganciclovir since [**11-13**].
   -Consider GI c/s for scope if no improvement in 72 hours.
   #.  Hypotension. Likely dehydration in setting of poor PO intake with
   dysphagia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and hyponatremia.  Also on
   ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's immunocompromised state, PE,
   splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD, bleeding unlikely given stable
   to elevated hematocrit at admission.  MAPS now high 70s.
   - continue albumin dose at noon today, dose with spironolactone and
   lasix given peripheral edema
   - F/u blood, urine cultures
   - d/c Vanc/Zosyn as sepsis unlikely with negative blood ctx X48H.
   - Tripped home steroids [**11-13**] to give stress dose steroids in this
   acute illness; patient likely has some adrenal insufficiency, plan for
   3 days of this
   - Likely contributed to by hypovolemic hyponatremia second to third
   spacing
   .
   #.  Altered mental status: Likely from dilaudid use and hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Feel that less likely is hypoperfusion from
   hypotension,  infection, less likely hypercalcemia or brain metastases.
     Overall improved today, might be because of increased perfusion of
   prain.  CMV could also account for mental status changes rarely.
   -hold dilaudid for now, if needed, use 0.25mg doses
   -adjunct pain medication with topical lidocaine/maalox/diphenhydramine
   rinse
   -Narcan if concern for respiratory status
   - f/u cultures
    -lactulose seems to have cleared MS some, continue
   - will hold on head CT for now given improvement and likely need for
   contrast to evaluate mets
   #  tachycardia: could be secondary to intravascular depletion, however
   this is improving with BPs.  Could also be from pain.  Diff dx includes
   PE, however would likely not alter management and would require dye for
   CTA.
   -continue volume repletion
   #.  Liver failure - Pt with known extensive liver mets.  No evidence of
   biliary obstruction on ultrasound.  Liver disease significant with
   hepatic encephalopathy and elevated LFTs and T Bili.  Cpuld also be
   caused by CMV.
   -hold diuretics for now
   -aggressive nutrition
   -lactulose
   # Hct drop: likely dilutional.  recheck at 1pm with platelets as well
   -guiaic stools
   -active T&S
   #. Elevated Coags: Likely due to decreased synthetic function in the
   liver. Now trending down except for bili.  DIC labs normal.  Lovenox
   Factor Xa appropriate at 0.88.
   #   Breast cancer
   -per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10240**] hospice care sounds appropriate discussion.
   #.  Hypercalcemia.  A recurrent problem for this patient with widely
   metastatic cancer. Corrected ca has normalized to 9.1
   -continue to monitor
   #.  DVT

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with breast cancer and extensive liver metastases, presenting with dysphagia, hypotension, and altered mental status. She has a history of cancer treatment, including chemotherapy and steroids, which has likely contributed to her immunocompromised state. The patient's condition has been complicated by fulminant hepatic failure, acute renal failure, and candidal esophagitis. She is currently receiving treatment with fluconazole, Ganciclovir, and albumin infusions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's immunocompromised state and recent negative blood culture results make sepsis a possible complication.
2. Candidal Esophagitis: The patient's thrush and ongoing treatment with fluconazole increase the risk of candidal esophagitis.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure and elevated ammonia levels increase the risk of hepatic encephalopathy.
4. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's altered mental status and possible aspiration pneumonia increase the risk of acute respiratory failure.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient's history of hypercalcemia and ongoing treatment with calcium supplements increase the risk of hypercalcemia.
6. Dehydration: The patient's poor oral intake, diuretic use, and hyponatremia increase the risk of dehydration.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure and ongoing treatment with diuretics increase the risk of worsening renal function.
8. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and recent negative blood culture results make infection a possible complication.
9. Bleeding: The patient's liver failure and possible coagulopathy increase the risk of bleeding.
10. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension and ongoing treatment with vasopressors increase the risk of hypotension.

Plan:

1. Continue treatment with fluconazole and Ganciclovir for candidal esophagitis and CMV.
2. Monitor the patient's liver function and adjust treatment as necessary.
3. Continue albumin infusions to support the patient's liver function.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as necessary.
5. Consider GI c/s for scope if no improvement in 72 hours.
6. Continue lactulose to manage hepatic encephalopathy.
7. Monitor the patient's mental status and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Continue prophylaxis with LMW heparin for DVT.
9. Monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust treatment as necessary.
10. Discuss hospice care with the patient and her sister."

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   45F with breast cancer with mets to bone and liver presenting with
   dysphagia and hypotension
   #.  Hypotension. Likely dehydration in setting of poor PO intake with
   dysphagia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and hyponatremia.  Also on
   ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's immunocompromised state, PE,
   splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD, bleeding unlikely given stable
   to elevated hematocrit.  MAPS now high 70s.
   - Continue IVF boluses as needed for MAP<60, although patient is likely
   third spacing IVF with such a low albumin.  Now on albumin [**Hospital1 7**]
   - F/u blood, urine cultures
   - consider d/c Vanc/Zosyn as CMV positive.
   - Tripped home steroids [**11-13**] to give stress dose steroids in this
   acute illness; patient likely has some adrenal insufficiency, plan for
   3 days of this
   - Hold diuresis for now
   - Likely contributed to by hypovolemic hyponatremia second to third
   spacing
   .
   #.  Altered mental status: Likely from dilaudid use and hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Feel that less likely is hypoperfusion from
   hypotension,  infection, less likely hypercalcemia or brain metastases.

   - Will get CT head to evaluate for metastatic disease, as could  be
   causing altered mental status
   #  tachycardia: could be secondary to intravascular depletion, consider
   CTA chest to r/o PE.
   #.  Dysphagia - Pt immunocopromised on chemo and steroids, also with
   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush,
   however positive for CMV.  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest
   not showing bulky disease in chest, and would be less likely to cause
   pain.   Now CMV positive.
   -rx for now for candidal esophagitis with fluconazole 200mg daily for
   14-21 days.  Consider d/c since now on treatment with Gangcylovir
   -Consider GI c/s for scope if no improvement in 72 hours.
   #.  Liver failure - Pt with known extensive liver mets.  No evidence of
   biliary obstruction on ultrasound.  Liver disease significant with
   hepatic encephalopathy and elevated LFTs and T Bili.  Cpuld also be

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), BREAST
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   45F with breast cancer with mets to bone and liver presenting with
   dysphagia and hypotension
   .
   #.  Hypotension. Likely dehydration in setting of poor PO intake with
   dysphagia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and hyponatremia.  Also on
   ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's immunocompromised state, PE,
   splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD, bleeding unlikely given stable
   to elevated hematocrit.  Pt now s/p 5.5L IVF and BP stable with MAPs in
   the 60
s-70
   - Continue IVF boluses as needed for MAP<60, although patient is likely
   third spacing IVF with such a low albumin.  Will give sodium bicarb in
   fluid if needs further fluid resuscitation
   - F/u blood, urine cultures
   - Continue Vanc/Zosyn for now but may not need antibiotics if
   clinically improves and cultures negative, sepsis less likely at this
   time
   - Will triple home steroid dose to give stress dose steroids in this
   acute illness; patient likely has some adrenal insufficiency
   - Hold diuresis for now
   - Likely contributed to by hypovolemic hyponatremia second to third
   spacing
   - TTE today to assess for pericardial effusion in setting of low
   voltage on ECG, hypotension, metastatic cancer
   - Can consider albumin to help keep fluids intravascularly
   .
   #.  Altered mental status: Likely from dilaudid use and hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Feel that less likely is hypoperfusion from
   hypotension,  infection, less likely hypercalcemia or brain metastases.
   -hold dilaudid for now, if needed, use 0.25mg doses
   -adjunct pain medication with topical lidocaine/maalox/diphenhydramine
   rinse
   -Narcan if concern for respiratory status
   - f/u cultures
    -lactulose for a few doses to see if improves mental status
   - Will get CT head to evaluate for metastatic disease, as could  be
   causing altered mental status
   .
   #.  Dysphagia - Pt immunocopromised on chemo and steroids, also with
   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush, making
   esophageal candidiasis most likely, also on ddx includes viral
   esophagitis (CMV, HSV).  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest not
   showing bulky disease in chest, and would be less likely to cause
   pain.   Now CMV positive.
   -rx for now for candidal esophagitis with fluconazole 200mg daily for
   14-21 days.  Consider change to gangciclovir or another [**Doctor Last Name **].
   -Consider GI c/s for scope if no improvement in 72 hours.
   #.  Liver failure - Pt with known extensive liver mets.  No evidence of
   biliary obstruction on ultrasound.  Liver disease significant with
   hepatic encephalopathy and elevated LFTs and T Bili.  Cpuld also be
   caused by CMV.
   -hold diuretics for now
   -aggressive nutrition
   -lactulose
   # Hct drop: likely dilutional.  recheck at 1pm with platelets as well
   -sent haptoglobin
   .
   #. Elevated Coags: Likely due to decreased synthetic function in the
   liver. Now trending down except for bili.  DIC labs normal.  Lovenox
   Factor Xa appropriate at 0.88.

   Code status:
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with breast cancer, metastatic to the bone and liver, presenting with dysphagia and hypotension. She has developed acute renal failure, fulminant hepatic failure, and is at risk for sepsis. The patient has a history of cancer, immunosuppression, and is currently receiving chemotherapy and steroids.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's immunocompromised state, poor PO intake, and high BUN/Cr ratio make her susceptible to sepsis.
2. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines make her prone to infection.
3. Bleeding: The patient's low albumin and platelet count make her at risk for bleeding.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's hypotension, poor PO intake, and diuretic use may contribute to hyponatremia.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's liver failure and decreased synthetic function may lead to electrolyte imbalance.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's altered mental status and potential for sepsis may increase her risk of respiratory failure.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's pericardial effusion and low voltage on ECG may indicate cardiac involvement.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's dysphagia and presence of thrush in the oropharynx may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as esophageal candidiasis and obstruction.
9. Metastatic disease: The patient's breast cancer has metastasized to the liver and bone, and may spread to other organs.
10. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's stress dose steroids may indicate adrenal insufficiency.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical complications. She should be treated with antibiotics for potential sepsis, and her fluid status should be closely monitored to prevent further dehydration. The patient's albumin levels should be closely monitored to prevent further third spacing. The patient's mental status should be closely monitored for signs of worsening encephalopathy, and her pain should be managed with adjunctive medication. The patient's GI status should be closely monitored for signs of obstruction or candidal esophagitis. The patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored to prevent electrolyte imbalance. The patient's cardiac status should be closely monitored for signs of cardiac involvement."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with metastatic breast cancer now with presentation with
   significant hypotension in the setting of increased dosing of dilaudid
   needed for severe oral/esophageal pain which in the setting of
   significant hepatic dysfunction may have had prolonged effects and now
   with time patient has had substantial improvement in mental status and
   blood pressure and now is faced with modest persistent renal
   dysfunction and extra-vascular volume overload.  This has all trended
   to better with most prominent issue going forward working to establish
   a regimen to provide stability in regards to volume status with likely
   role for diuretics with caution given recent hypotension.
   1)Altered Mental Status-
   -Lactulose
   -Dilaudid minimized
   -Blood pressure improved
   -Will continue to monitor exam but very reassuring now
   2)Hypotension-This is likely a combination of narcotics with extensive
   impact in the setting of ongoing difficulty with intravascular volume
   with hepatic failure.
   -Vanco/Zosyn
will D/C if cultures negative at 72 hours
   -Dex 12mg IV qd
   -Albumin [**Hospital1 7**]
   -GCV in place
   -Will move to D/C albumin at 48 hours with hope for improved balance
   across time
   3)Oliguria-Patient has significant oliguria but preserved Creatinine
   levels
we have seen increase in urine output across time
   -Will continue with Albumin across time
   -Will move to standing diuretic starting at low dose
   4)CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), BREAST-
   -Appreciate Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10240**]
s input
   -Will work to discuss with family goals of her care and path to
   treatment from here
   5)Hepatic Failure-
   -Patient with persistent hyperbilirubinemia and elevation of AP with
   mild persistent elevation of transaminases
   -Continue with lactulose
   -Will need to maintain
   6)Esophagitis-Likely a combination of fungal and viral contribution
   -Will continue with Fluconazole as well as gancyclovir
   -Local pain control

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with metastatic breast cancer now with presentation with
   significant hypotension in the setting of increased dosing of dilaudid
   needed for severe oral/esophageal pain which in the setting of
   significant hepatic dysfunction may have had prolonged effects and now
   with time patient has had substantial improvement in mental status and
   blood pressure and now is faced with modest persistent renal
   dysfunction and extra-vascular volume overload.  This has all trended
   to better with most prominent issue going forward working to establish
   a regimen to provide stability in regards to volume status with likely
   role for diuretics with caution given recent hypotension.
   1)Altered Mental Status-
   -Lactulose
   -Dilaudid minimized
   -Blood pressure improved
   -Will continue to monitor exam but very reassuring now
   2)Hypotension-This is likely a combination of narcotics with extensive
   impact in the setting of ongoing difficulty with intravascular volume
   with hepatic failure.
   -Vanco/Zosyn
will D/C if cultures negative at 72 hours
   -Dex 12mg IV qd
   -Albumin [**Hospital1 7**]
   -GCV in place
   -Will move to D/C albumin at 48 hours with hope for improved balance
   across time
   3)Oliguria-Patient has significant oliguria but preserved Creatinine
   levels
we have seen increase in urine output across time
   -Will continue with Albumin across time
   -Will move to standing diuretic starting at low dose
   4)CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), BREAST-
   -Appreciate Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10240**]
s input
   -Will work to discuss with family goals of her care and path to
   treatment from here
   5)Hepatic Failure-
   -Patient with persistent hyperbilirubinemia and elevation of AP with
   mild persistent elevation of transaminases
   -Continue with lactulose
   -Will need to maintain
   6)Esophagitis-Likely a combination of fungal and viral contribution
   -Will continue with Fluconazole as well as gancyclovir
   -Local pain control

Summary:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer, presenting with hypotension, altered mental status, and breast cancer. She has been experiencing tachycardia, fatigue, and abdominal pain. Her lab results show elevated liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinemia, and mild persistent elevation of transaminases. She has been prescribed various medications, including dilaudid, vancomycin, and gancyclovir.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Oliguria: The patient's urine output is significantly decreased, which can lead to acute kidney injury and potential need for dialysis.
2. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, which can lead to further deterioration of her condition and potential liver failure.
3. Esophagitis: The patient has a high risk of developing esophagitis due to her underlying condition and the use of antifungal and antiviral medications.
4. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of central lines and indwelling ports increase her risk of developing infections.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely related to her underlying condition and the use of dilaudid, which can exacerbate her hypotension.
6. Renal dysfunction: The patient's persistent renal dysfunction can lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
7. Volume overload: The patient's extra-vascular volume overload can lead to further complications, such as pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's esophagitis and gastric ulcers can increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Septic shock: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of central lines and indwelling ports increase her risk of developing septic shock.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   45F with breast cancer with mets to bone and liver presenting with
   dysphagia and hypotension and now with BRPBR.
   # GI Bleed: BRBPR yesterday.  Gave vitamin K and stopped enoxaparin.
   Subsequent Hct have been stable at 31.  No further episodes of red
   blood in stool. PTT continues to be elevated.
   -continue [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   -consider protamine if further episodes bleeding or Hct drop
   .
   #.  Dysphagia - Pt immunocopromised on chemo and steroids, also with
   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush,
   however positive for CMV.  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest
   not showing bulky disease in chest, and would be less likely to cause
   pain.
   -Cotinue fluconazole for candidal esophagitis for 14-21 days
   - continue Ganciclovir ([**11-13**]-present); course for immunocompromised pt
   [**Name (NI) **] is 3-6 weeks, which is appropriate in this case.
   #.  Hypotension: Improved, likely dehydration in setting of poor PO
   intake with dysphagia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and
   hyponatremia.  Also on ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's
   immunocompromised state, PE, splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD,
   bleeding unlikely given stable to elevated hematocrit at admission.
   MAPS now high 70s.
   - prn albumin if becomes acutely hypotensive or tachycardia worsens
   - d/c Vanc/Zosyn as sepsis unlikely with negative blood ctx X48H.
   - Trippled home steroids [**11-13**] to give stress dose steroids in this

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with breast cancer and metastases to the bone and liver, presenting with dysphagia, hypotension, and now with bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract (BRBPR). The patient has undergone several interventions, including the administration of vitamin K, stopping of enoxaparin, and initiation of Ganciclovir therapy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T (36.7°C), HR (94 bpm), BP (99/68 mmHg), RR (28 breaths/min), SpO2 (99%)
* Laboratory results: Hct (31.2%), WBC (7.1 K/μL), Plt (110 K/μL), Cr (0.7 mg/dL), Glucose (107 mg/dL), LFTs (ALT 145 U/L, AST 192 U/L, Alk Phos 493 U/L, T Bili 20.6 μmol/L), and INR (1.5)
* Physical examination: No acute distress, alert and oriented, with scleral icterus, normocephalic, and soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Bleeding: The patient has had a significant drop in Hct (from 41.9% to 31.2%) and is at risk of further bleeding due to the ongoing use of diuretics and the presence of liver disease.
2. Infection: The patient is immunocompromised due to chemotherapy and steroids, and is at risk of developing infections, particularly pneumonia and sepsis.
3. Liver failure: The patient has known extensive liver metastases and is at risk of developing liver failure, which could lead to further complications, including bleeding, infection, and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has a high BUN/cr ratio and hyponatremia, which could be due to dehydration, diuretic use, or liver disease.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has abnormal electrolyte levels, including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia, which could be due to liver disease, diuretic use, or other underlying conditions.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing Ganciclovir therapy for 3-6 weeks
2. Restarting home dose of PO lasix and aldactone
3. Aggressive nutrition
4. Holding lactulose for now
5. Monitoring for bleeding and adjusting therapy as needed
6. Continuing telemetry monitoring
7. Considering protamine if further bleeding occurs
8. Discussing hospice care with the patient and family

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and improve her overall condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-inch tall, 74.5 kg woman with a history of breast cancer, currently in the ICU due to gastrointestinal bleeding, liver failure, and acute renal failure. She has been experiencing fatigue, but her throat pain has decreased, and she is able to swallow more. She has no nausea, vomiting, dizziness, lightheadedness, or palpitations.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 99/68 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 28 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99%. She is receiving oxygen therapy, but not mechanically ventilated.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 31.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 110 K/uL. Her liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Her renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes a history of cancer, and she is currently receiving ganciclovir therapy. She has also received antibiotics, including piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, and fluconazole.

Potential medical complications:

1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and multi-organ failure.
2. Progression of liver failure, which could lead to hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and increased risk of bleeding.
3. Acute kidney injury, which could lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of cardiovascular complications.
4. Infection, particularly pneumonia, which could be complicated by her immunocompromised state and respiratory therapy.
5. Thrombocytopenia, which could increase the risk of bleeding and require platelet transfusions.
6. Hypotension, which could be exacerbated by her underlying medical conditions and require vasopressor therapy.
7. Metabolic derangements, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, which could require insulin therapy.
8. Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure, which could be exacerbated by her underlying medical conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   45F with breast cancer with mets to bone and liver presenting with
   dysphagia and hypotension
   # GI Bleed: BRBPR yesterday.  Gave vitamin K and stopped enoxaparin.
   Subsequent Hct have been stable at 32.  No further episodes of red
   blood in stool. PTT continues to be elevated.
   -continue [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   -consider protamine if further episodes bleeding or Hct drop
   .
   #.  Dysphagia - Pt immunocopromised on chemo and steroids, also with
   liver failure, white plaques in oropharynx suggestive of thrush,
   however positive for CMV.  Obstruction unlikely given recent CT chest
   not showing bulky disease in chest, and would be less likely to cause
   pain.
   -rx for now for candidal esophagitis with fluconazole 200mg daily for
   14-21 days given thrush on exam, now also on Ganciclovir since [**11-13**].
   course for Ganciclovir for immunocompromised pt [**Name (NI) **] is 3-6 weeks
   depending on if sxs are resolving
   #.  Hypotension. Likely dehydration in setting of poor PO intake with
   dysphagia, diuretic use, high BUN/cr ratio and hyponatremia.  Also on
   ddx is infection/sepsis given pt's immunocompromised state, PE,
   splanchnic pooling in setting of ESLD, bleeding unlikely given stable
   to elevated hematocrit at admission.  MAPS now high 70s.
   - continue albumin dose at noon today, dose with spironolactone and
   lasix given peripheral edema
   - F/u blood, urine cultures
   - d/c Vanc/Zosyn as sepsis unlikely with negative blood ctx X48H.
   - Trippled home steroids [**11-13**] to give stress dose steroids in this
   acute illness; patient likely has some adrenal insufficiency, plan for
   3 days of this (last day today)
   - Likely contributed to by hypovolemic hyponatremia second to third
   spacing
   .
   #.  Altered mental status: Likely from dilaudid use and hepatic
   encephalopathy.  Feel that less likely is hypoperfusion from
   hypotension,  infection, less likely hypercalcemia or brain
   metastases.   Overall improved today, might be because of increased
   perfusion of prain.  CMV could also account for mental status changes
   rarely.
   -hold dilaudid for now, if needed, use 0.25mg doses
   -adjunct pain medication with topical lidocaine/maalox/diphenhydramine
   rinse
   -Narcan if concern for respiratory status
   - f/u cultures
    -lactulose seems to have cleared MS some, continue
   - will hold on head CT for now given improvement and likely need for
   contrast to evaluate mets
   #  tachycardia: could be secondary to intravascular depletion, however
   this is improving with BPs.  Could also be from pain.  Diff dx includes
   PE, however would likely not alter management and would require dye for
   CTA.
   -continue volume repletion
   #.  Liver failure - Pt with known extensive liver mets.  No evidence of
   biliary obstruction on ultrasound.  Liver disease significant with
   hepatic encephalopathy and elevated LFTs and T Bili.  Cpuld also be
   caused by CMV.
   -hold diuretics for now
   -aggressive nutrition
   -lactulose
   # Hct drop: likely dilutional.  recheck at 1pm with platelets as well
   -guiaic stools
   -active T&S
   #. Elevated Coags: Likely due to decreased synthetic function in the
   liver. Now trending down except for bili.  DIC labs normal.  Lovenox
   Factor Xa appropriate at 0.88.
   #   Breast cancer
   -per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 10240**] hospice care sounds appropriate discussion.
   #.  Hypercalcemia.  A recurrent problem for this patient with widely
   metastatic cancer. Corrected ca has normalized to 9.1
   -continue to monitor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - developed BRBPR, gave vitamin K and stopped enoxaparin
   - Hct dropped but increased in pm check
   - pharmacy says it's very strange to have elevated PTT from lovenox,
   but could try protamine if we think elevated PTT due to lovenox: dose
   would be 1mg for every 1mg lovenox given and if PTT (or PT since PT

Summary:

The patient, a 45-year-old female with breast cancer and metastases to bone and liver, is currently in the ICU with several ongoing medical issues. She was admitted with dysphagia and hypotension, and has since developed a gastrointestinal bleed, which has been managed with vitamin K and cessation of enoxaparin. Her hematocrit has stabilized, but her platelet count remains low. She is also experiencing altered mental status, likely due to dilaudid use and hepatic encephalopathy. Her liver function tests are abnormal, and she has been diagnosed with liver failure.

The patient is also experiencing tachycardia, which may be secondary to intravascular depletion or pain. Her blood pressure is improving, and she is receiving volume repletion. She has been diagnosed with hypercalcemia, which is a recurrent problem for this patient. Her coagulation studies are abnormal, but DIC labs are normal.

The patient's medications include lasix, furosemide, and spironolactone for fluid management, as well as fluconazole for candidal esophagitis. She is also receiving ganciclovir for immunocompromised status.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's hematocrit has stabilized, but her platelet count remains low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
2. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, and she has been diagnosed with liver failure, which may lead to further complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised status and recent antibiotic use may increase her risk of infection.
4. Sepsis: The patient's fever and altered mental status may be indicative of sepsis.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient's corrected calcium level has normalized, but she may still be at risk for further hypercalcemia episodes.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's abnormal coagulation studies may increase her risk of bleeding or clotting complications.
7. Dehydration: The patient's fluid management is ongoing, and she may still be at risk for dehydration.
8. Pain: The patient's altered mental status and tachycardia may be indicative of pain, which may need to be managed accordingly.

The patient's medical team should continue to monitor her closely for these potential complications and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo female with metastatic breast cancer admitted with oro-pharyngeal
   candidiasis with course complicated by hypotension.  We had substantial
   concern for worsening respiratory status but today has increased
   comfort with limitation on further fluid being given.
   1) GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, LOWER (HEMATOCHEZIA, BRBPR, GI BLEED,
   GIB)-HCT has been without change
   -Follow stool output
   -Will provide vitamin K for support
   -Will need to consider FFP for any further bleeding
   2)HYPOTENSION-This has been considered multifactorial with relative
   compromise of effective filling pressures, substantial decrease in
   oncotic pressure and vasodilatory effects of dilaudid with prolonged
   impact in the setting of hepatic dysfunction and possible infection
   -Vanco/Zosyn
   -Dex 12mg/d
   -Emiric antibiotics will be D/C
d at 72 hours of culture negative
   -GCV--for positive CMV viral load
   -Will move to aldactone lasix
   3)ALTERED MENTAL STATUS-
   -Lactulose
   4)ORO-PHARYNGEAL PAIN-This is likely related to fungal infection with
   significant pain noted with good response to local treatment
   -Fluconazole to continue
   -Will continue with local Rx
   5)HEPATIC FAILURE--likely secondary to metastatic insult from breast
   cancer mets.
   -Lactulose
   -Lasix/Aldactone
   -Albumin as needed for hypotension was reasonable but not needed now
   -Will need to follow coagulopathy going forward
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Will move to PO intake today as tolerated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer, admitted with oro-pharyngeal candidiasis and complicated by hypotension. The patient's condition is multifactorial, with potential complications including:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has experienced hematochezia, BRBPR, and GI bleeding, which may be related to the breast cancer metastasis. The patient's HCT has been stable, and stool output will be monitored. Vitamin K will be provided for support, and FFP may be considered if further bleeding occurs.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, with possible causes including relative compromise of effective filling pressures, decreased oncotic pressure, and vasodilatory effects of dilaudid. The patient is receiving Vanco/Zosyn, and Dex 12mg/d has been added. Emiric antibiotics will be discontinued at 72 hours of culture-negative results. GCV has been ordered for a positive CMV viral load.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be related to the breast cancer metastasis, and lactulose has been ordered.
4. Oropharyngeal pain: The patient's pain is likely related to the fungal infection, and fluconazole will continue. Local treatment will also be continued.
5. Hepatic failure: The patient's hepatic failure is likely secondary to the metastatic insult from breast cancer. Lactulose and Lasix/Aldactone have been ordered, and albumin may be needed for hypotension.

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: The patient will be transitioned to PO intake today as tolerated.
* Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels will be monitored and managed as needed.
* Lines: The patient has an indwelling port and an 18-gauge line.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for DVT and will receive prophylaxis with boots. Anticoagulation will be re-evaluated.
* Stress ulcer: The patient will receive PPI prophylaxis.
* VAP: The patient will be monitored for VAP.

The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is transfer to the floor. The total time spent in the ICU is 35 minutes."
