   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Based on the available information, it is
   difficult to say what initiated change in mental status. Differential
   includes infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source
   in setting of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia,
   seizure, retention of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of
   admission AFTER intubation demonstrated hypercarbia). Stroke in setting
   of AF (not anticoagulated) seems less likely given patient was reported
   to move all extremities, respond to some commands. Head CT negative for
   bleed or other acute pathology. No new medications to account for
   change in mental status.
   Lactate 1.5.
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings; treat for 7
   day course abx for hospital-acquired pathogens
   - Follow up repeat ABG, goal CO2 about 50
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - No signs of RV strain, tachycardia to suggest PE (consideration given
   concurrent malignancy).
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
   - Urine, blood cultures. Sputum cultures if possible.
   - Appreciate Neuro c/s
   - MRI brain: prelim no acute pathology, await final read
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF; will
   reattempt today, unlikely bacterial meningitis, concern for
   carcinomatous meningitis given malignancy
   - EEG today
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status.
   - Off sedation.
   - Did well on 0/5.
   - Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent admission),
   will hold off on adding additional gram negative coverage given
   arrhythmias and concern for prolongation of QTc (and difficult to say
   if patient truly has consolidation).
   - Currently does not appear to be CHF exacerbation
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. No
   history of digoxin use, other consideration would be hypoxia,
   reperfusion, or this could be patient's baseline.
   - Rule out MI
   - Checking electrolytes
   - Monitoring on telemetry.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia.
   - Similar to prior EKGs.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, serial hematocrits
   - Urology consult in AM, urgently if needed overnight for increasing
   hematuria
   - Follow up final CT abdomen/pelvis
   - CBI if develops clots or significant hematuria.
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home.
   - R/O MI by cycling cardiac enzymes.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded.
   - Hold lasix for now, may need fluids to be given back given clinical
   picture.
   - BNP pending.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient's current HCT may be hemoconcentrated given that he
   was recently in the 25-28 range while at [**Hospital1 608**] when he received PRBC
   transfusion. Continue iron supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend, consider transfusion if rules in or HCT
   <30.
   .
   #) FEN: Holding TFs for now as hopefully will be able to extubate soon.
   Checking and repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI.
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   (Called tonight)
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last
   Friday--catheter was placed and kept re-clotting, so was sent back to
   the hospital. Son reports that surgeons noted tumor in his kidneys; the
   plan was for intervention at later. Patient [**Street Address(1) 2318**] Place
   nursing home. Son and patient discussed code status approximately 2
   weeks ago.. patient reportedly stated ""if I can come back I can come
   back."" Per discussion with nursing home physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1068**] PCP had
   noted patient was DNR/DNI, however paperwork was not filled out. When
   nursing home physician discussed this with patient and son, nursing
   home physician was unsure that son and patient were clear on what
   DNR/DNI meant, as patient expressed wishes more consistent with full
   code.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.

   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings; treat for 7
   day course abx for hospital-acquired pathogens
   - Follow up repeat ABG, goal CO2 about 50
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - No signs of RV strain, tachycardia to suggest PE (consideration given
   concurrent malignancy).
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
   - Urine, blood cultures. Sputum cultures if possible.
   - Appreciate Neuro c/s
   - MRI brain: prelim no acute pathology, await final read
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF; will
   reattempt today, unlikely bacterial meningitis, concern for
   carcinomatous meningitis given malignancy
   - EEG today
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status.
   - Off sedation.
   - Did well on 0/5.
   - Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent admission),
   will hold off on adding additional gram negative coverage given
   arrhythmias and concern for prolongation of QTc (and difficult to say
   if patient truly has consolidation).
   - Currently does not appear to be CHF exacerbation
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. No
   history of digoxin use, other consideration would be hypoxia,
   reperfusion, or this could be patient's baseline.
   - Rule out MI
   - Checking electrolytes
   - Monitoring on telemetry.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia.
   - Similar to prior EKGs.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, serial hematocrits
   - Urology consult in AM, urgently if needed overnight for increasing
   hematuria
   - Follow up final CT abdomen/pelvis
   - CBI if develops clots or significant hematuria.
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home.
   - R/O MI by cycling cardiac enzymes.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded.
   - Hold lasix for now, may need fluids to be given back given clinical
   picture.
   - BNP pending.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient's current HCT may be hemoconcentrated given that he
   was recently in the 25-28 range while at [**Hospital1 608**] when he received PRBC
   transfusion. Continue iron supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend, consider transfusion if rules in or HCT
   <30.
   .
   #) FEN: Holding TFs for now as hopefully will be able to extubate soon.
   Checking and repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI.
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   (Called tonight)
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last
   Friday--catheter was placed and kept re-clotting, so was sent back to
   the hospital. Son reports that surgeons noted tumor in his kidneys; the
   plan was for intervention at later. Patient [**Street Address(1) 2318**] Place
   nursing home. Son and patient discussed code status approximately 2
   weeks ago.. patient reportedly stated ""if I can come back I can come
   back."" Per discussion with nursing home physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1068**] PCP had
   noted patient was DNR/DNI, however paperwork was not filled out. When
   nursing home physician discussed this with patient and son, nursing
   home physician was unsure that son and patient were clear on what
   DNR/DNI meant, as patient expressed wishes more consistent with full
   code.

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, intubated for airway protection, and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 114/55 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 15 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98% on a FiO2 of 40%.

The patient has a history of hematuria and was recently diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. He has undergone surgery for removal of the tumor and is currently receiving treatment for the disease.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.1, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 162,000/μL. His serum creatinine is 1.5 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen is 25 mg/dL. His troponin level is 0.08 ng/mL, and his CK-MB level is 29 ng/mL.

The patient's radiological imaging studies show a retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray and a negative MRI brain scan. His electrocardiogram (EKG) shows an accelerated idioventricular rhythm with some PVCs.

The patient's medical conditions and treatment plan include:

* Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is unclear, and the differential diagnosis includes infection, arrhythmia, seizure, and retention of CO2. A toxicology screen was negative, and the patient is being treated for possible aspiration pneumonia.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation for airway protection and respiratory failure. He is being treated for possible pneumonia.
* Rhythm: The patient's EKG shows an accelerated idioventricular rhythm with some PVCs. The rhythm is being monitored, and the patient is being treated with SQ heparin and PPI.
* Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria: The patient has a history of hematuria and was recently diagnosed with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. He is being treated with chemotherapy and is at risk for bleeding and hematuria.
* CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and is being treated with statins.
* Congestive heart failure: The patient has a history of congestive heart failure and is being treated with diuretics.
* GERD: The patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is being treated with PPI.
* COPD: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is being treated with bronchodilators.
* Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia and is being treated with iron supplementation.
* Renal insufficiency: The patient has a history of renal insufficiency and is being treated with diuretics and electrolyte replacement.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his intubation and mechanical ventilation.
* Arrhythmia: The patient's EKG shows an accelerated idioventricular rhythm with some PVCs, and he is at risk for arrhythmia.
* Retention of CO2: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to retention of CO2, which can cause acidosis and respiratory failure.
* Hematuria: The patient's history of hematuria and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder puts him at risk for bleeding and hematuria.
* Bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and hematuria puts him at risk for bleeding complications.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to respiratory failure and death.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continued mechanical ventilation and respiratory support
* Treatment for possible aspiration pneumonia
* Treatment for possible arrhythmia
* Treatment for possible retention of CO2
* Monitoring for hematuria and bleeding
* Monitoring for respiratory failure and death
* Consideration of extubation and weaning from mechanical ventilation
* Consideration of discharge to a rehabilitation facility or home health care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient remains intubated and sedated due to worsening MS symptoms. They have shown some improvement in being more awake this morning. The patient has undergone MRI and EEG, and a lumbar puncture (LP) was attempted without success. They are receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antacids, and heparin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 114/55 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation. Laboratory results show mild anemia, normal white blood cell count, and elevated troponin levels.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and they are dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory decline or complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Neurological deterioration: The patient's MS symptoms have worsened, and there is a risk of further neurological deterioration or complications such as cerebral edema.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, particularly pneumonia, due to their intubation and mechanical ventilation.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage.
5. Metabolic complications: The patient's glycemic control is a concern, and there is a risk of developing hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest potential cardiac damage, and there is a risk of developing cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and sedated. Despite the lack of improvement in their condition, they are more awake this morning. They have a history of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) to evaluate for metastasis, but the results are not mentioned. The patient has a Foley catheter in place with cranberry-colored urine, indicating possible bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 114/55 mmHg. Their respiratory support consists of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Their arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.39, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 45 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 112 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals irregularly irregular heart sounds, distant heart sounds, and occasional rhonchi in the lungs. They have excoriations over both lower extremities and trace edema of the feet. Neurological examination shows spontaneous movement of all extremities, withdrawal to noxious stimuli, and movement to name calling.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) of 155 K/uL. Blood chemistry results indicate an elevated creatinine (Cr) of 1.5 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.08 ng/mL, and lactic acid of 0.3 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC and lactic acid levels may indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is complex, and they may be at risk for respiratory failure if their oxygenation or ventilation requirements increase.
3. Bleeding: The patient's cranberry-colored urine and elevated troponin-T levels may indicate bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and neurological examination findings may indicate neurological complications, such as stroke or cerebral edema, which can lead to permanent brain damage or death.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels may indicate kidney injury, which can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's irregularly irregular heart sounds and elevated troponin-T levels may indicate cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac failure, which can lead to cardiogenic shock and death.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's soft abdomen and absence of bowel sounds may indicate gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction or perforation, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Based on the available information, it is
   difficult to say what initiated change in mental status. Differential
   includes infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source
   in setting of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia,
   seizure, retention of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of
   admission AFTER intubation demonstrated hypercarbia). Stroke in setting
   of AF (not anticoagulated) seems less likely given patient was reported
   to move all extremities, respond to some commands. Head CT negative for
   bleed or other acute pathology. No new medications to account for
   change in mental status.
   Lactate 1.5.
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings.
   - Follow up repeat ABG, goal CO2 about 50
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - No signs of RV strain, tachycardia to suggest PE (consideration given
   concurrent malignancy).
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
   - Urine, blood cultures. Sputum cultures if possible.
   - Appreciate Neuro c/s
   - MRI brain: prelim no acute pathology, await final read
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF
   - EEG today
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status.
   - Off sedation.
   - Did well on 0/5.
   - Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent admission),
   will hold off on adding additional gram negative coverage given
   arrhythmias and concern for prolongation of QTc (and difficult to say
   if patient truly has consolidation).
   - Currently does not appear to be CHF exacerbation
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. No
   history of digoxin use, other consideration would be hypoxia,
   reperfusion, or this could be patient's baseline.
   - Rule out MI
   - Checking electrolytes
   - Monitoring on telemetry.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia.
   - Similar to prior EKSs.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, serial hematocrits
   - Urology consult in AM, urgently if needed overnight for increasing
   hematuria
   - Follow up final CT abdomen/pelvis
   - CBI if develops clots or significant hematuria.
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home.
   - R/O MI by cycling cardiac enzymes.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded.
   - Hold lasix for now, may need fluids to be given back given clinical
   picture.
   - BNP pending.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient's current HCT may be hemoconcentrated given that he
   was recently in the 25-28 range while at [**Hospital1 608**] when he received PRBC
   transfusion. Continue iron supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend, consider transfusion if rules in or HCT
   <30.
   .
   #) FEN: Holding TFs for now as hopefully will be able to extubate soon.
   Checking and repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI.
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   (Called tonight)
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last
   Friday--catheter was placed and kept re-clotting, so was sent back to
   the hospital. Son reports that surgeons noted tumor in his kidneys; the
   plan was for intervention at later. Patient [**Street Address(1) 2318**] Place
   nursing home. Son and patient discussed code status approximately 2
   weeks ago.. patient reportedly stated ""if I can come back I can come
   back."" Per discussion with nursing home physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1068**] PCP had
   noted patient was DNR/DNI, however paperwork was not filled out. When
   nursing home physician discussed this with patient and son, nursing
   home physician was unsure that son and patient were clear on what
   DNR/DNI meant, as patient expressed wishes more consistent with full
   code.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Based on the available information, it is
   difficult to say what initiated change in mental status. Differential
   includes infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source
   in setting of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia,
   seizure, retention of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of
   admission AFTER intubation demonstrated hypercarbia). Stroke in setting
   of AF (not anticoagulated) seems less likely given patient was reported
   to move all extremities, respond to some commands. Head CT negative for
   bleed or other acute pathology. No new medications to account for
   change in mental status.
   Lactate 1.5.
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings.
   - Follow up repeat ABG, goal CO2 about 50
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - No signs of RV strain, tachycardia to suggest PE (consideration given
   concurrent malignancy).
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
   - Urine, blood cultures. Sputum cultures if possible.
   - Appreciate Neuro c/s
   - MRI brain: prelim no acute pathology, await final read
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF
   - EEG today
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status.
   - Off sedation.
   - Did well on 0/5.
   - Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent admission),
   will hold off on adding additional gram negative coverage given
   arrhythmias and concern for prolongation of QTc (and difficult to say
   if patient truly has consolidation).
   - Currently does not appear to be CHF exacerbation
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. No
   history of digoxin use, other consideration would be hypoxia,
   reperfusion, or this could be patient's baseline.
   - Rule out MI
   - Checking electrolytes
   - Monitoring on telemetry.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia.
   - Similar to prior EKSs.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, serial hematocrits
   - Urology consult in AM, urgently if needed overnight for increasing
   hematuria
   - Follow up final CT abdomen/pelvis
   - CBI if develops clots or significant hematuria.
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home.
   - R/O MI by cycling cardiac enzymes.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded.
   - Hold lasix for now, may need fluids to be given back given clinical
   picture.
   - BNP pending.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer. He was admitted to the ICU from a nursing home with altered mental status, intubated for airway protection. He has a history of recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma and had hematuria requiring re-admission. He is currently intubated and sedated, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 0/5. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 114/55 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has a high risk of aspiration pneumonia due to his altered mental status and intubation.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already intubated and sedated, and his respiratory status is critical. He may require further respiratory support, such as mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's EKG shows an accelerated idioventricular rhythm, and he has a history of atrial fibrillation. He may be at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial flutter or fibrillation.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency, and his current creatinine level is 1.5 mg/dL. He may be at risk for further renal deterioration.
5. Hematuria: The patient has a history of hematuria, and his current urinary output is decreased. He may require further evaluation and treatment for his hematuria.
6. Infection: The patient has a high risk of infection due to his altered mental status, intubation, and recent surgery.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and his current INR is 1.3. He may be at risk for further gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of neurological disorders, including atrial fibrillation and bladder cancer. He may be at risk for further neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires continued close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiac, and renal status. He should be closely monitored for signs of aspiration pneumonia, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrhythmias. His hematuria should be further evaluated and treated as necessary. He should also be closely monitored for signs of infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and neurological complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection, successfully extubated yesterday.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Still remains unclear what prompted acute
   mental status change. Most likely was secondary to infection +/- COPD
   with CO2 retention. Differential at time of admission included
   infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source in setting
   of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia, seizure, retention
   of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of admission AFTER
   intubation demonstrated hypercarbia), or stroke
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings; treat for 7
   day course abx for hospital-acquired pathogens, on
   vanco/zosyn/azithromycin (day 4 of abx)
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
none noted
   - Culture data negative to date
   - Appreciate Neuro assistance
   - MRI brain: no evidence of acute stroke or lesions
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF; should
   likely re-attempt to rule out leptomeningeal spread of malignancy,
   although this is less likely to account for acute change given
   improvement without significant intervention.
   - EEG did not suggest seizures.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status, successfully extubated yesterday.
   -          Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent
   admission), added azithromycin today (today is day 4 of vanco/zosyn),
   will complete 7 day course.
   -          When patient was seen on rounds, appeared to have some
   wheezes. In conjunction with CXR, appears more of a fluid
   overloaded/pulm edema state, so will diuresis (home dose 20 mg lasix)
   with 40 mg IV lasix, change albuterol nebs to standing and PRN, and
   consider steroids if wheezing is not improved with diuresis.
   -          Checking urinary legionella antigen.
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. Old
   EKGs demonstrate this is not a new finding. He has been ruled out for
   MI.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia and diuresis today
   (and wheezing), will add back BB if BP tolerates today or tomorrow
   given history of CAD.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, currently on slower CBI without
   any hematuria.
   - Appreciate urology assistance, recommended CBI until urine clear/pink
   (with TCC resection, CBI better to help scar form and stop hematuria)
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home. Ruled out for MI.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded,
   but CXR could be consistent with CHF
   - Given CXR and wheezing this AM, giving IV lasix with goal of net out
   today.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides. Today is improved to 1.3.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Slightly down today. Will hold off on transfusion as he does
   not have significant hematuria, but transfuse if <25 or symptoms. Given
   B12 was borderline low, will check MMA. Continuing iron
   supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend.
   .
   #) FEN: Concern for aspiration by nursing staff, requesting speech and
   swallow evalutation.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI (changing to PO given no evidence of GIB).
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection, successfully extubated yesterday.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Still remains unclear what prompted acute
   mental status change. Most likely was secondary to infection +/- COPD
   with CO2 retention. Differential at time of admission included
   infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source in setting
   of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia, seizure, retention
   of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of admission AFTER
   intubation demonstrated hypercarbia), or stroke
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings; treat for 7
   day course abx for hospital-acquired pathogens, on
   vanco/zosyn/azithromycin (day 4 of abx)
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
none noted
   - Culture data negative to date
   - Appreciate Neuro assistance
   - MRI brain: no evidence of acute stroke or lesions
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF; should
   likely re-attempt to rule out leptomeningeal spread of malignancy,
   although this is less likely to account for acute change given
   improvement without significant intervention.
   - EEG did not suggest seizures.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status, successfully extubated yesterday.
   -          Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent
   admission), added azithromycin today (today is day 4 of vanco/zosyn),
   will complete 7 day course.
   -          When patient was seen on rounds, appeared to have some
   wheezes. In conjunction with CXR, appears more of a fluid
   overloaded/pulm edema state, so will diuresis (home dose 20 mg lasix)
   with 40 mg IV lasix, change albuterol nebs to standing and PRN, and
   consider steroids if wheezing is not improved with diuresis.
   -          Checking urinary legionella antigen.
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. Old
   EKGs demonstrate this is not a new finding. He has been ruled out for
   MI.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia and diuresis today
   (and wheezing), will add back BB if BP tolerates today or tomorrow
   given history of CAD.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, currently on slower CBI without
   any hematuria.
   - Appreciate urology assistance, recommended CBI until urine clear/pink
   (with TCC resection, CBI better to help scar form and stop hematuria)
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home. Ruled out for MI.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded,
   but CXR could be consistent with CHF
   - Given CXR and wheezing this AM, giving IV lasix with goal of net out
   today.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides. Today is improved to 1.3.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Slightly down today. Will hold off on transfusion as he does
   not have significant hematuria, but transfuse if <25 or symptoms. Given
   B12 was borderline low, will check MMA. Continuing iron
   supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend.
   .
   #) FEN: Concern for aspiration by nursing staff, requesting speech and
   swallow evalutation.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI (changing to PO given no evidence of GIB).
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last
   Friday--catheter was placed and kept re-clotting, so was sent back to
   the hospital. Son reports that surgeons noted tumor in his kidneys; the
   plan was for intervention at later. Patient [**Street Address(1) 2318**] Place
   nursing home. Son and patient discussed code status approximately 2
   weeks ago.. patient reportedly stated ""if I can come back I can come
   back."" Per discussion with nursing home physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1068**] PCP had
   noted patient was DNR/DNI, however paperwork was not filled out. When
   nursing home physician discussed this with patient and son, nursing
   home physician was unsure that son and patient were clear on what
   DNR/DNI meant, as patient expressed wishes more consistent with full
   code.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway protection, and successfully extubated yesterday. The patient's mental status remains unclear, with a differential diagnosis including infection, arrhythmia, seizure, retention of CO2, and stroke. Imaging studies, including a CT scan and MRI, have ruled out acute stroke or lesions.

The patient's respiratory status is also a concern, with a diagnosis of pneumonia and fluid overload/pulmonary edema. He is being treated with antibiotics and diuresis, and his wheezing is being monitored.

Cardiac rhythm is irregular, with an accelerated idioventricular rhythm and PVCs. The patient has a history of CAD and has been ruled out for MI. He is being held on beta-blockers and diovan due to borderline blood pressure.

Other medical conditions include transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria, and renal insufficiency. The patient has a history of gout and anemia, and is being monitored for these conditions.

Potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The patient's mental status remains unclear, and infection remains a possibility.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, with a diagnosis of pneumonia and fluid overload/pulmonary edema.
3. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient's cardiac rhythm is irregular, with an accelerated idioventricular rhythm and PVCs.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient has a history of renal insufficiency and is being monitored for this condition.
5. Hematuria: The patient has a history of hematuria and is being monitored for this condition.
6. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia and is being monitored for this condition.
7. Gout: The patient has a history of gout and is being monitored for this condition.
8. Fluid overload: The patient is at risk for fluid overload due to his respiratory status and diuresis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

* The patient's mental status has improved, and they were extubated around 2:30 pm.
* The preliminary EEG results are normal.
* The MRI revealed a dolichoectatic aneurysm in the distal right vertebral artery.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.8°F, heart rate of 78 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/49 mmHg.
* The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via a face tent and has a SpO2 of 96%.
* The patient's laboratory results show normal to mildly abnormal values, with the exception of a slightly elevated lactate level of 0.3 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Increased risk of bleeding due to the presence of a dolichoectatic aneurysm in the distal right vertebral artery.
* Risk of cerebral vasospasm or infarction due to the aneurysm.
* Potential for further neurological deterioration or stroke.
* Risk of infection due to the patient's prolonged hospitalization and use of central lines and other invasive devices.
* Risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), due to the patient's recent extubation and ongoing oxygen therapy.
* Risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction, due to the patient's underlying medical condition and use of medications.
* Risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation, due to the patient's use of anticoagulant medications and underlying medical condition.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan as necessary to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Based on the available information, it is
   difficult to say what initiated change in mental status. Differential
   includes infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source
   in setting of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia,
   seizure, retention of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of
   admission AFTER intubation demonstrated hypercarbia). Stroke in setting
   of AF (not anticoagulated) seems less likely given patient was reported
   to move all extremities, respond to some commands. Head CT negative for
   bleed or other acute pathology. No new medications to account for
   change in mental status.
   Lactate 1.5.
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings; treat for 7
   day course abx for hospital-acquired pathogens
   - Follow up repeat ABG, goal CO2 about 50
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - No signs of RV strain, tachycardia to suggest PE (consideration given
   concurrent malignancy).
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
   - Urine, blood cultures. Sputum cultures if possible.
   - Appreciate Neuro c/s
   - MRI brain: prelim no acute pathology, await final read
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF; will
   reattempt today, unlikely bacterial meningitis, concern for
   carcinomatous meningitis given malignancy
   - EEG today
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status.
   - Off sedation.
   - Did well on 0/5.
   - Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent admission),
   will hold off on adding additional gram negative coverage given
   arrhythmias and concern for prolongation of QTc (and difficult to say
   if patient truly has consolidation).
   - Currently does not appear to be CHF exacerbation
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. No
   history of digoxin use, other consideration would be hypoxia,
   reperfusion, or this could be patient's baseline.
   - Rule out MI
   - Checking electrolytes
   - Monitoring on telemetry.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia.
   - Similar to prior EKGs.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, serial hematocrits
   - Urology consult in AM, urgently if needed overnight for increasing
   hematuria
   - Follow up final CT abdomen/pelvis
   - CBI if develops clots or significant hematuria.
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home.
   - R/O MI by cycling cardiac enzymes.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded.
   - Hold lasix for now, may need fluids to be given back given clinical
   picture.
   - BNP pending.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient's current HCT may be hemoconcentrated given that he
   was recently in the 25-28 range while at [**Hospital1 608**] when he received PRBC
   transfusion. Continue iron supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend, consider transfusion if rules in or HCT
   <30.
   .
   #) FEN: Holding TFs for now as hopefully will be able to extubate soon.
   Checking and repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI.
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last
   Friday--catheter was placed and kept re-clotting, so was sent back to
   the hospital. Son reports that surgeons noted tumor in his kidneys; the
   plan was for intervention at later. Patient [**Street Address(1) 2318**] Place
   nursing home. Son and patient discussed code status approximately 2
   weeks ago.. patient reportedly stated ""if I can come back I can come
   back."" Per discussion with nursing home physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1068**] PCP had
   noted patient was DNR/DNI, however paperwork was not filled out. When
   nursing home physician discussed this with patient and son, nursing
   home physician was unsure that son and patient were clear on what

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 year old male with past medical history of coronary
   artery disease status post bypass, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal
   insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer who presents from a nursing
   home with altered mental status, intubated in the ED for airway
   protection.
   .
   #) Altered mental status: Based on the available information, it is
   difficult to say what initiated change in mental status. Differential
   includes infection (especially after aspiration event, urinary source
   in setting of recent instrumentation, prostatitis), arrhythmia,
   seizure, retention of CO2 in setting of history of COPD (ABG at time of
   admission AFTER intubation demonstrated hypercarbia). Stroke in setting
   of AF (not anticoagulated) seems less likely given patient was reported
   to move all extremities, respond to some commands. Head CT negative for
   bleed or other acute pathology. No new medications to account for
   change in mental status.
   Lactate 1.5.
   - Based on CXR and CT that imaged part of the base of lungs, there is
   concern for aspiration pneumonia given dependant findings; treat for 7
   day course abx for hospital-acquired pathogens
   - Follow up repeat ABG, goal CO2 about 50
   - Toxicology screen: negative
   - Abd/pelvis CT negative for any RP bleed or other acute pathology
   - No signs of RV strain, tachycardia to suggest PE (consideration given
   concurrent malignancy).
   - Ruled out MI (less likely), suspect elevated troponin is in setting
   of renal failure, CK's flat.
   - Monitor on telemetry for arrhythmia
   - Urine, blood cultures. Sputum cultures if possible.
   - Appreciate Neuro c/s
   - MRI brain: prelim no acute pathology, await final read
   - Attempted LP, difficult to position, unable to obtain CSF; will
   reattempt today, unlikely bacterial meningitis, concern for
   carcinomatous meningitis given malignancy
   - EEG today
   .
   #) Respiratory failure: Intubated initially for airway protection given
   concerns about his mental status.
   - Off sedation.
   - Did well on 0/5.
   - Treating for pneumonia (Hospital-acquired given recent admission),
   will hold off on adding additional gram negative coverage given
   arrhythmias and concern for prolongation of QTc (and difficult to say
   if patient truly has consolidation).
   - Currently does not appear to be CHF exacerbation
   .
   #) Rhythm: Patient appears to be in accelerated idioventricular rhythm
   on monitoring and EKG, with some PVCs. On EKG, rhythm appears regular,
   but alternatively patient could be in slower atrial fibrillation. No
   history of digoxin use, other consideration would be hypoxia,
   reperfusion, or this could be patient's baseline.
   - Rule out MI
   - Checking electrolytes
   - Monitoring on telemetry.
   - Holding beta-blocker given episode of bradycardia.
   - Similar to prior EKGs.
   .
   #) Transitional cell carcinoma, hematuria:
   Patient had recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma.
   Per discussion with son and [**Name2 (NI) 2315**] at the nursing home, patient had
   had hematuria requiring re-admission.
   - Will continue to monitor hematuria, serial hematocrits
   - Urology consult in AM, urgently if needed overnight for increasing
   hematuria
   - Follow up final CT abdomen/pelvis
   - CBI if develops clots or significant hematuria.
   - Continue to monitor output with goal >40cc/hr.
   .
   #) CAD: Continue home statin. Holding BB and diovan in setting of
   borderline BP and diovan (given unknown baseline creatinine) and
   borderline BP. Not on ASA at home.
   - R/O MI by cycling cardiac enzymes.
   .
   #) Congestive heart failure: Per report, patient has a normal ejection
   fraction, so suspect that he likley has some degree of diastolic
   dysfunction. Currently he does not appear grossly volume overloaded.
   - Hold lasix for now, may need fluids to be given back given clinical
   picture.
   - BNP pending.
   .
   #) GERD: Continue PPI.
   .
   #) COPD: Continue home nebs, advair.
   .
   #) History of gout: Continue home allopurinol
   .
   #) Renal insufficiency: Creatinine was 1.5 over last week per OSH
   records. Unclear what baseline is, could be in part related to history
   of renal metastases that son provides.
   - Continue to follow trend, avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient's current HCT may be hemoconcentrated given that he
   was recently in the 25-28 range while at [**Hospital1 608**] when he received PRBC
   transfusion. Continue iron supplementation.
   - Continue to monitor trend, consider transfusion if rules in or HCT
   <30.
   .
   #) FEN: Holding TFs for now as hopefully will be able to extubate soon.
   Checking and repleting electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #) PPx: SQ Heparin, on PPI.
   .
   #) Communication: Son [**Name (NI) 20**] [**Name (NI) 2316**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2317**].
   Per his report, patient had a ""scraping"" of his bladder last
   Friday--catheter was placed and kept re-clotting, so was sent back to
   the hospital. Son reports that surgeons noted tumor in his kidneys; the
   plan was for intervention at later. Patient [**Street Address(1) 2318**] Place
   nursing home. Son and patient discussed code status approximately 2
   weeks ago.. patient reportedly stated ""if I can come back I can come
   back."" Per discussion with nursing home physician, [**Name Initial (NameIs) 1068**] PCP had
   noted patient was DNR/DNI, however paperwork was not filled out. When
   nursing home physician discussed this with patient and son, nursing
   home physician was unsure that son and patient were clear on what
   DNR/DNI meant, as patient expressed wishes more consistent with full
   code.

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, and bladder cancer. He was admitted to the ICU from a nursing home with altered mental status, intubated for airway protection. The patient has undergone recent surgery for removal of transitional cell carcinoma and has had hematuria requiring re-admission.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent surgery and instrumentation may have increased the risk of aspiration, and his altered mental status and intubation may have contributed to the development of pneumonia.
2. Infection: The patient's recent instrumentation and instrumentation may have increased the risk of infection, particularly urinary tract infection (UTI) or prostatitis.
3. Arrhythmia: The patient's atrial fibrillation and recent surgery may have increased the risk of arrhythmia, and his elevated troponin levels may be related to renal failure rather than myocardial infarction.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's intubation and respiratory failure may be related to his underlying COPD and pneumonia.
5. Congestive heart failure: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent surgery may have increased the risk of congestive heart failure, and his borderline blood pressure may be related to his underlying renal insufficiency.
6. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): The patient's recent surgery and instrumentation may have increased the risk of GERD, and his continued use of PPI may be necessary to manage symptoms.
7. Anemia: The patient's recent blood transfusion and ongoing hematuria may have contributed to his anemia, and his continued use of iron supplementation may be necessary to manage symptoms.
8. Renal insufficiency: The patient's underlying renal insufficiency may be exacerbated by his recent surgery and instrumentation, and his continued use of nephrotoxic agents may need to be avoided.
9. Carcinomatous meningitis: The patient's history of bladder cancer and recent surgery may have increased the risk of carcinomatous meningitis, and his continued use of antibiotics may be necessary to manage symptoms.
10. Neurological complications: The patient's recent surgery and instrumentation may have increased the risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizure, and his continued use of anticonvulsants may be necessary to manage symptoms."
