   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib,
   rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN, who
   presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Sepsis:  Meets SIRS criteria with fever and tachycardia, though
   patient has chronic a.fib at baseline, and pneumonia as possible
   infectious source.  Other possible sources of infection in her include
   UTI (culture pending), abdominal process given recent surgery, and
   meningitis, though exam not consistent clinically with this condition.
   Will treat empirically for primary lung source but have low threshold
   for abdominal imaging given risk factors, elevated LFTs.  Was on
   bactrim at [**Hospital1 246**] for unclear indication.
   - cont vanc/zosyn
   - hold bactrim
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30 cc/hr
   - no central venous line for now but follow BP closely
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve
   - low threshold for abdominal CT
   - will not correct INR for now or perform LP
   - low-dose vitamin K to bring INR < 3 so PICC can be placed.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Appears tachypnic currently with
   suctioning of tan secretions from ETT in a.m. of [**2142-6-15**].  Follow-up
   CXR shows volume overload.
   - lasix for diuresis
   - I/O goal of -1L
   - weane O2 on  trach collar
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3 normally.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process/toxic-metabolic.  Would also consider other
   metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative and defering LP as described
   above.  TSH and B12 wnl, RPR neg
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   though would consider other etiologies such as toxic ingestion and
   infection if enzymes do not trend down.
   - trend LFTs
   - consider serum/urine tox if not improving
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - cont digoxin, metoprolol
   - holding warfarin for now in setting of INR > 3.0, antibiotics, but
   will need for stroke risk and MVR
   - daily coags
   # Mitral valve replacement:  Mechanical valve per report and history of
   rheumatic heart disease.
   - daily INR
   - restart warfarin once INR<3
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: warfarin once INR<3

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic heart failure (right-sided), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, and mechanical mitral valve replacement. She presents with altered mental status (AMS) and suspected sepsis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 91 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 134/73 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 31 inspirations per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 96% on aerosol-cooled oxygen delivery.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds, tachypnea, and a soft abdomen. Her neurological examination is not assessed due to her altered mental status.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, indicating an inflammatory response. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with a alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 71 IU/L and an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 76 IU/L. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal impairment.

The patient's medical plan includes treatment for suspected sepsis, including empiric antibiotics, fluid management, and close monitoring of her vital signs. She is also receiving treatment for hypoxic respiratory failure, including oxygen therapy and diuretics. Her altered mental status is being managed with antibiotics and close monitoring of her neurological status.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, or cardiovascular instability.
2. Worsening of chronic heart failure, leading to increased pulmonary congestion and decreased cardiac output.
3. Development of respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
4. Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's anticoagulation therapy and mechanical valve replacement.
5. Progression of liver dysfunction, potentially leading to coagulopathy and increased risk of bleeding.
6. Development of kidney injury, requiring dialysis or other forms of renal replacement therapy.
7. Increased risk of infection, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression and invasive devices.
8. Worsening of mental status, potentially leading to delirium or coma.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, close monitoring and aggressive management of her symptoms and underlying conditions are essential to prevent these potential complications and improve her overall outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Patient Summary:**

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure (CHF), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, and mechanical mitral valve replacement. She presents with altered mental status (AMS) and suspected sepsis.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Sepsis:** The patient meets SIRS criteria with fever and tachycardia, and has a possible infectious source in her lungs. Empiric antibiotics have been started, and further cultures are pending. There is a low threshold for abdominal imaging due to risk factors and elevated liver enzymes.
2. **Altered Mental Status (AMS):** The patient's AMS is likely secondary to an infectious process or toxic-metabolic disorder. Other metabolic causes of AMS should be considered, and a low threshold for further workup, including a head CT and lumbar puncture, should be maintained.
3. **Transaminitis:** Elevated liver enzymes are likely due to hypotension and shock liver, but other etiologies, such as toxic ingestion and infection, should be considered if enzymes do not trend down.
4. **Atrial Fibrillation:** The patient's atrial fibrillation is likely contributing to her tachycardia. Digoxin levels are normal, and consideration should be given to restarting metoprolol once the patient stabilizes.
5. **Mitral Valve Replacement:** The patient has a mechanical mitral valve replacement, which requires ongoing anticoagulation with warfarin. The INR should be closely monitored, and warfarin restarted once the INR is less than 3.
6. **Fluid Overload:** The patient has received a significant amount of fluid in the past 24 hours, which may contribute to her AMS and fluid overload. Close monitoring of her fluid status is essential to prevent further complications.
7. **Pneumonia:** The patient has a possible infectious source in her lungs, which should be further evaluated with imaging studies and cultures.

**Plan:**

1. Continue empiric antibiotics for suspected sepsis.
2. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider further workup, including a head CT and lumbar puncture.
3. Trend liver enzymes and consider serum and urine toxicology if not improving.
4. Continue digoxin and consider restarting metoprolol once the patient stabilizes.
5. Monitor the patient's INR and restart warfarin once the INR is less than 3.
6. Continue anticoagulation with warfarin for the mechanical mitral valve replacement.
7. Monitor the patient's fluid status and consider further fluid restriction if necessary.
8. Consider further imaging studies, such as a CT scan, to evaluate the patient's lungs and abdomen."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib,
   rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN, who
   presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Pneumonia/sepsis:  At time of admission, met SIRS criteria with fever
   and tachycardia with pneumonia as infectious source.  Also considered
   abdominal process given recent surgery but no abdominal pain.  Chest CT
   confirms diffuse infiltrates and currently being covered with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.   Was
   on bactrim at [**Hospital1 246**] for unclear indication.
   - cont vanc/ceftaz (day [**4-3**])
   - hold bactrim
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30 cc/hr
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve
   - will not correct INR for now or perform LP
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  S/p trach after failing extubation
   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded on admission after receiving IVFs but diuresed with good
   effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to respiratory
   failure.
   - lasix for diuresis
   - I/O goal of -1L
   - weane O2 on  trach collar
   - pneumonia management as above
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3 normally.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process/toxic-metabolic.  Would also consider other
   metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative and defering LP as described
   above.  TSH and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with
   treatment of pneumonia.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   trending down since admission.
   - trend LFTs
   - consider serum/urine tox if not improving
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - cont digoxin, metoprolol
   - warfarin held in setting of INR > 3.0, antibiotics, but restarted on
   [**2142-6-16**]
   - daily coags
   # Mitral valve replacement:  Mechanical valve per report and history of
   rheumatic heart disease.
   - daily INR
   - warfarin restarted because INR<3
   # Communication: Patient, family. [**Doctor First Name **] is son [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6114**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib,
   rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN, who
   presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Pneumonia/sepsis:  At time of admission, met SIRS criteria with fever
   and tachycardia with pneumonia as infectious source.  Also considered
   abdominal process given recent surgery but no abdominal pain.  Chest CT
   confirms diffuse infiltrates and currently being covered with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.   Was
   on bactrim at [**Hospital1 246**] for unclear indication.
   - cont vanc/ceftaz (day [**4-3**])
   - hold bactrim
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30 cc/hr
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve
   - will not correct INR for now or perform LP
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  S/p trach after failing extubation
   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded on admission after receiving IVFs but diuresed with good
   effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to respiratory
   failure.
   - lasix for diuresis
   - I/O goal of -1L
   - weane O2 on  trach collar
   - pneumonia management as above
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3 normally.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process/toxic-metabolic.  Would also consider other
   metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative and defering LP as described
   above.  TSH and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with
   treatment of pneumonia.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   trending down since admission.
   - trend LFTs
   - consider serum/urine tox if not improving
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - cont digoxin, metoprolol
   - warfarin held in setting of INR > 3.0, antibiotics, but restarted on
   [**2142-6-16**]
   - daily coags
   # Mitral valve replacement:  Mechanical valve per report and history of
   rheumatic heart disease.
   - daily INR
   - warfarin restarted because INR<3

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, and a mechanical mitral valve replacement. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status and suspected sepsis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.4°C, HR 77 bpm, BP 107/53 mmHg, RR 23 breaths/min, SpO2 98%
* Respiratory support: Invasive ventilation, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 50%, Vt 400 mL
* Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation, mechanical mitral valve replacement, severe tricuspid regurgitation
* Renal function: Serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dL, urine output 30 cc/hr
* Liver function: Elevated LFTs (ALT 46 IU/L, AST 44 IU/L), trending down
* Blood culture: Sputum culture pending, previously received antibiotics (Zosyn, Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, Ceftazidime)

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, fever, and tachycardia suggest sepsis, and the presence of pneumonia on chest CT scan supports this diagnosis.
* Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to pneumonia and may require further treatment.
* Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is unclear, and the cause is unknown. Infectious disease management is ongoing, and other metabolic causes should be considered.
* Transaminitis: The patient's elevated LFTs may be related to hypotension and shock liver, and should be trended and considered for serum/urine tox if not improving.
* Bleeding risk: The patient's mechanical mitral valve replacement and INR > 3.0 suggest a risk of bleeding, and warfarin should be restarted once the INR is < 3.0.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Infectious disease management: Broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia, with plans to hold bactrim and continue vanc/ceftaz
* Respiratory support: Invasive ventilation, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 50%, Vt 400 mL
* Cardiovascular management: Lasix for diuresis, I/O goal of -1L, wean O2 on trach collar
* Liver function management: Trend LFTs, consider serum/urine tox if not improving
* Bleeding risk management: Restart warfarin once INR < 3.0, daily coags

The patient's family should be educated on her condition, treatment plan, and potential complications, and regular communication should be maintained."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib,
   rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN, who
   presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Sepsis:  Meets SIRS criteria with fever and tachycardia, though
   patient has chronic a.fib at baseline, and pneumonia as possible
   infectious source.  Other possible sources of infection in her include
   UTI (culture pending), abdominal process given recent surgery, and
   meningitis, though exam not consistent clinically with this condition.
   Will treat empirically for primary lung source but have low threshold
   for abdominal imaging given risk factors, elevated LFTs.  Was on
   bactrim at [**Hospital1 246**] for unclear indication.
   - cont vanc/zosyn
   - hold bactrim
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30 cc/hr
   - no central venous line for now but follow BP closely
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve
   - low threshold for abdominal CT
   - will not correct INR for now or perform LP
   - low-dose vitamin K to bring INR < 3 so PICC can be placed.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Appears tachypnic currently with
   suctioning of tan secretions from ETT in a.m. of [**2142-6-15**].  Follow-up
   CXR shows volume overload.
   - lasix for diuresis
   - I/O goal of -1L
   - weane O2 on  trach collar
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3 normally.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process/toxic-metabolic.  Would also consider other
   metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative and defering LP as described
   above.  TSH and B12 wnl, RPR neg
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   though would consider other etiologies such as toxic ingestion and
   infection if enzymes do not trend down.
   - trend LFTs
   - consider serum/urine tox if not improving
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - cont digoxin, metoprolol
   - holding warfarin for now in setting of INR > 3.0, antibiotics, but
   will need for stroke risk and MVR
   - daily coags
   # Mitral valve replacement:  Mechanical valve per report and history of
   rheumatic heart disease.
   - daily INR
   - restart warfarin once INR<3

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib,
   rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN, who
   presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Sepsis:  Meets SIRS criteria with fever and tachycardia, though
   patient has chronic a.fib at baseline, and pneumonia as possible
   infectious source.  Other possible sources of infection in her include
   UTI (culture pending), abdominal process given recent surgery, and
   meningitis, though exam not consistent clinically with this condition.
   Will treat empirically for primary lung source but have low threshold
   for abdominal imaging given risk factors, elevated LFTs.  Was on
   bactrim at [**Hospital1 246**] for unclear indication.
   - cont vanc/zosyn
   - hold bactrim
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30 cc/hr
   - no central venous line for now but follow BP closely
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve
   - low threshold for abdominal CT
   - will not correct INR for now or perform LP
   - low-dose vitamin K to bring INR < 3 so PICC can be placed.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Appears tachypnic currently with
   suctioning of tan secretions from ETT in a.m. of [**2142-6-15**].  Follow-up
   CXR shows volume overload.
   - lasix for diuresis
   - I/O goal of -1L
   - weane O2 on  trach collar
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3 normally.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process/toxic-metabolic.  Would also consider other
   metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative and defering LP as described
   above.  TSH and B12 wnl, RPR neg
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   though would consider other etiologies such as toxic ingestion and
   infection if enzymes do not trend down.
   - trend LFTs
   - consider serum/urine tox if not improving
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - cont digoxin, metoprolol
   - holding warfarin for now in setting of INR > 3.0, antibiotics, but
   will need for stroke risk and MVR
   - daily coags
   # Mitral valve replacement:  Mechanical valve per report and history of
   rheumatic heart disease.
   - daily INR
   - restart warfarin once INR<3
   # FEN: IVF prn, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: warfarin once INR<3

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic heart failure (right-sided), pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, and a mechanical mitral valve replacement. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS) and suspected sepsis. She has a history of recent surgery and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and vasopressors to maintain blood pressure.

Current Status:

* Vital signs: T = 36.4°C, HR = 77 bpm, BP = 107/53 mmHg, RR = 23 breaths/min, SpO2 = 98%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: MAP = 65 mmHg, CVP = 10 mmHg
* Respiratory support: Mechanical ventilation, FiO2 = 50%, PEEP = 5 cmH2O
* Laboratory results: WBC = 6.2, Hct = 22.6%, Platelets = 204 K/uL, LFTs = elevated, CRP = 25 mg/dL
* Imaging studies: CXR shows volume overload, CT head is negative

Assessment and Plan:

* Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria with fever and tachycardia, and has a possible primary lung source of infection. She is being treated empirically with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and has a low threshold for abdominal imaging given her risk factors and elevated LFTs.
* Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is tachypneic and has suctioning of tan secretions from her ETT. She is being treated with lasix for diuresis and weaned off oxygen.
* Altered Mental Status: The patient's AMS is likely secondary to an infectious process or toxic-metabolic cause. She is being treated with antibiotics and has a low threshold for LP.
* Transaminitis: The patient's elevated LFTs are likely due to hypotension and shock liver, but other etiologies are being considered.
* S/p Laparotomy: The patient is stable and has no abdominal pain or active issues.
* Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being treated with digoxin and metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Sepsis: The patient is at risk for septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction.
* Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory deterioration and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation.
* Altered Mental Status: The patient is at risk for further neurological deterioration and the need for LP.
* Transaminitis: The patient is at risk for further liver damage and the need for liver transplantation.
* Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias and the need for cardioversion.

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and hemodynamic status closely.
* Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and consider abdominal imaging.
* Continue to treat the patient's hypoxic respiratory failure with lasix and wean off oxygen.
* Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider LP if necessary.
* Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and consider liver transplantation if necessary.
* Consider cardioversion for the patient's atrial fibrillation."

   85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib,
   rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN, who
   presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Pneumonia/sepsis:  At time of admission, met SIRS criteria with fever
   and tachycardia with pneumonia as infectious source.  Also considered
   abdominal process given recent surgery but no abdominal pain.  Chest CT
   confirms diffuse infiltrates and currently being covered with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
   - cont vanc/ceftaz (day [**4-3**])
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  S/p trach after failing extubation
   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded on admission after receiving IVFs but diuresed with good
   effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to respiratory
   failure.
   - lasix prn
   - I/O goal of -1L
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3 normally.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process/toxic-metabolic.  Would also consider other
   metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative and defering LP as described
   above.  TSH and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with
   treatment of pneumonia.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   trending down since admission.
   - trend LFTs
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib,
   rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN, who
   presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Pneumonia/sepsis:  At time of admission, met SIRS criteria with fever
   and tachycardia with pneumonia as infectious source.  Also considered
   abdominal process given recent surgery but no abdominal pain.  Chest CT
   confirms diffuse infiltrates and currently being covered with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
   - cont vanc/ceftaz (day [**4-3**])
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  S/p trach after failing extubation
   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded on admission after receiving IVFs but diuresed with good
   effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to respiratory
   failure.
   - lasix prn
   - I/O goal of -1L
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3 normally.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process/toxic-metabolic.  Would also consider other
   metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative and defering LP as described
   above.  TSH and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with
   treatment of pneumonia.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   trending down since admission.
   - trend LFTs
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - cont digoxin, metoprolol
   - warfarin held in setting of INR > 3.0, antibiotics, but restarted on
   [**2142-6-16**]
   # Mitral valve replacement:  Mechanical valve per report and history of
   rheumatic heart disease.
   - daily INR
   - warfarin restarted because INR<3

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a complex medical history, including CHF, pulmonary HTN, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, and a mechanical mitral valve replacement.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated and ventilated due to hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to pneumonia and pulmonary HTN.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced hypotension, which is likely related to the tender Starling curve, extra lasix, and vent hemodynamics.
3. Altered mental status: The patient has had altered mental status, which is unclear whether it is a baseline condition or secondary to an infectious process or toxic-metabolic state.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated LFTs, which are likely related to hypotension and shock liver.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with digoxin and metoprolol.
6. Sepsis: The patient has met SIRS criteria with fever and tachycardia, and is being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and ventilated, which increases the risk of VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and the presence of a mechanical mitral valve replacement.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and the presence of hypotension.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's altered mental status and elevated LFTs may be related to metabolic acidosis, which can worsen if not managed promptly.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.

To address these potential complications, the patient should receive:

1. Aggressive pulmonary toilet to prevent VAP.
2. Prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent DVT.
3. Stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Close monitoring of electrolytes and acid-base balance to prevent metabolic acidosis.
5. Continuous cardiac monitoring to detect any cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's family should be educated on the importance of maintaining good respiratory hygiene, and the patient's son should be kept informed of the patient's condition and any changes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of respiratory failure, hypotension, and altered mental status. They have been receiving mechanical ventilation and have required additional lasix to manage their fluid status. Their cardiac status is stable, with an irregular atrial fibrillation rhythm. They have a recent history of pneumonia and are at risk for impaired skin integrity and physical mobility.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and they require ongoing mechanical ventilation to manage their oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and they require careful management of their fluid status to avoid hypovolemia or hypertension.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's risk of skin breakdown is high due to their prolonged ICU stay, and they require close monitoring and prevention measures.
4. Impaired physical mobility: The patient's physical mobility is limited, and they require regular turning, positioning, and mobilization to prevent pressure ulcers and promote respiratory function.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is a risk factor for stroke and thromboembolism, and they require anticoagulation therapy and close monitoring.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and they require tight glycemic control to prevent complications.
7. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is altered, and they require close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is a risk factor for respiratory failure, and they require ongoing antibiotic therapy and close monitoring.
9. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient is at risk for VTE due to their prolonged immobility and require prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and low-molecular-weight heparin.
10. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulceration due to their critical illness and require prophylactic acid suppression therapy."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib,
   rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN, who
   presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Pneumonia/sepsis:  At time of admission, met SIRS criteria with fever
   and tachycardia with pneumonia as infectious source.  Also considered
   abdominal process given recent surgery but no abdominal pain.  Chest CT
   confirms diffuse infiltrates and currently being covered with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.   Was
   on bactrim at [**Hospital1 246**] for unclear indication.
   - cont vanc/ceftaz (day [**4-3**])
   - hold bactrim
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30 cc/hr
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve
   - will not correct INR for now or perform LP
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  S/p trach after failing extubation
   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded on admission after receiving IVFs but diuresed with good
   effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to respiratory
   failure.
   - lasix for diuresis
   - I/O goal of -1L
   - weane O2 on  trach collar
   - pneumonia management as above
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3 normally.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process/toxic-metabolic.  Would also consider other
   metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative and defering LP as described
   above.  TSH and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with
   treatment of pneumonia.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   trending down since admission.
   - trend LFTs
   - consider serum/urine tox if not improving
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - cont digoxin, metoprolol
   - warfarin held in setting of INR > 3.0, antibiotics, but restarted on
   [**2142-6-16**]
   - daily coags
   # Mitral valve replacement:  Mechanical valve per report and history of
   rheumatic heart disease.
   - daily INR
   - warfarin restarted because INR<3

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib,
   rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR, HTN, who
   presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Pneumonia/sepsis:  At time of admission, met SIRS criteria with fever
   and tachycardia with pneumonia as infectious source.  Also considered
   abdominal process given recent surgery but no abdominal pain.  Chest CT
   confirms diffuse infiltrates and currently being covered with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.   Was
   on bactrim at [**Hospital1 246**] for unclear indication.
   - cont vanc/ceftaz (day [**4-3**])
   - hold bactrim
   - IVF boluses to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30 cc/hr
   - Follow-up blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve
   - will not correct INR for now or perform LP
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  S/p trach after failing extubation
   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded on admission after receiving IVFs but diuresed with good
   effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to respiratory
   failure.
   - lasix for diuresis
   - I/O goal of -1L
   - weane O2 on  trach collar
   - pneumonia management as above
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3 normally.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process/toxic-metabolic.  Would also consider other
   metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative and defering LP as described
   above.  TSH and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with
   treatment of pneumonia.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   trending down since admission.
   - trend LFTs
   - consider serum/urine tox if not improving
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - cont digoxin, metoprolol
   - warfarin held in setting of INR > 3.0, antibiotics, but restarted on
   [**2142-6-16**]

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a complex medical history, including chronic heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, and a mechanical mitral valve replacement. She is currently in the ICU with a diagnosis of pneumonia, sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, and altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, and blood pressure of 131/69 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy via a trach mask and is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, and liver enzymes, indicating an inflammatory response and potential organ damage. Her blood cultures are pending, and she is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Continuing vancomycin and ceftazidime antibiotics for pneumonia.
2. Holding bactrim due to unclear indication.
3. IVF boluses to maintain mean arterial pressure >65 mmHg and urine output >30 cc/hr.
4. Trending WBC count and fever curve.
5. Monitoring for signs of sepsis and adjusting treatment as needed.
6. Weaning oxygen therapy on trach collar.
7. Managing pneumonia with antibiotics and respiratory support.
8. Trending liver enzymes and considering serum and urine toxicology tests if LFTs do not improve.
9. Restarting warfarin due to INR > 3.0.
10. Monitoring for signs of bleeding and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as needed.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to her pneumonia and sepsis diagnosis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and mechanical mitral valve replacement may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or valve failure.
4. Liver damage: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver damage, which could worsen if not properly managed.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may increase her risk of bleeding complications.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing additional infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or urinary tract infections.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications and improve her clinical outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is an  85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary
   HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR,
   HTN, who presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Pneumonia/sepsis:  At time of admission, met SIRS criteria with fever
   and tachycardia with pneumonia as infectious source.  Also considered
   abdominal process given recent surgery but no abdominal pain.  Chest CT
   suggests diffuse infiltrates and currently being covered with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
   - Cont vanc/ceftaz (day [**5-3**])
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  S/p trach after failing extubation
   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded during hospitalization after receiving IVFs but diuresed
   with good effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to
   respiratory failure.  TBB LOS >7L. Increased WOB today now back on NIV.
   - lasix gtt, goal TBB -1000 cc
   - Check ABG
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process, toxic-metabolic, or hypoxia/increased WOB.  Would
   also consider other metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative.  TSH
   and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with treatment of
   pneumonia.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   trending down since admission.
   - trend LFTs
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is an  85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary
   HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR,
   HTN, who presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Pneumonia/sepsis:  At time of admission, met SIRS criteria with fever
   and tachycardia with pneumonia as infectious source.  Also considered
   abdominal process given recent surgery but no abdominal pain.  Chest CT
   suggests diffuse infiltrates and currently being covered with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
   - Cont vanc/ceftaz (day [**5-3**])
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  S/p trach after failing extubation
   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded during hospitalization after receiving IVFs but diuresed
   with good effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to
   respiratory failure.  TBB LOS >7L. Increased WOB today now back on NIV.
   - lasix gtt, goal TBB -1000 cc
   - Check ABG
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process, toxic-metabolic, or hypoxia/increased WOB.  Would
   also consider other metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative.  TSH
   and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with treatment of
   pneumonia.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   trending down since admission.
   - trend LFTs
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - Continue digoxin, metoprolol with goal HR 80-100
   - Coumadin held in setting of INR > 3.0 with antibiotics, restarted on
   [**2142-6-16**]. Goal INR [**2-27**].

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of chronic heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rheumatic heart disease, and mitral valve replacement. She was admitted to the ICU with acute mental status changes, tachypnea, and oxygen requirement increasing to 100% FM. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia and has shown improvement in her mental status.

Current Status:

* Vital signs: Tachypneic, tachycardic, with a temperature of 36.2°C, blood pressure of 99/63 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's central venous pressure is not elevated, and her cardiac output is adequate.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received 1,800 mL of fluid and has a total output of 635 mL, with a balance of 1,165 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy through a tracheostomy mask and has a tidal volume of 3-2 L.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 13.6 K/uL, and her lactate level is 0.7 mmol/L.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia/sepsis: The patient's pneumonia may continue to worsen, leading to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to increased work of breathing and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may persist or worsen, potentially leading to further complications such as aspiration or falls.
4. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated liver enzymes may continue to worsen, potentially leading to liver dysfunction and coagulopathy.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may continue to worsen, potentially leading to increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and death.
6. Mitral Valve Replacement: The patient's mechanical mitral valve replacement may require ongoing anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombosis and embolism.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic status to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old patient in the ICU with a chief complaint of being screened for [**Hospital1 **]. They continue to be tachypneic. The patient has a history of pneumonia, other, and has received antibiotics including ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and ceftazidime. They have impaired skin integrity, impaired physical mobility, atrial fibrillation, hypernatremia, and altered mental status. The patient has a PICC line and a 20-gauge IV line.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may indicate hypovolemic shock or cardiogenic shock.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin may become further compromised, leading to increased risk of infection and poor wound healing.
4. Impaired physical mobility: The patient's immobility may lead to further deconditioning, increased risk of pressure ulcers, and decreased respiratory function.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output and increased risk of stroke.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may worsen, leading to seizures, cerebral edema, and increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to increased risk of falls, decreased respiratory function, and decreased ability to communicate.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to increased risk of respiratory failure, sepsis, and multi-organ dysfunction.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological status. They should be assessed for any signs of worsening respiratory failure, hypotension, or altered mental status, and interventions should be implemented promptly to address these issues."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is an  85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary
   HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR,
   HTN, who presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Pneumonia/sepsis:  At time of admission, met SIRS criteria with fever
   and tachycardia with pneumonia as infectious source.  Also considered
   abdominal process given recent surgery but no abdominal pain.  Chest CT
   suggests diffuse infiltrates and currently being covered with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
   - Cont vanc/ceftaz (day [**5-3**])
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  S/p trach after failing extubation
   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded during hospitalization after receiving IVFs but diuresed
   with good effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to
   respiratory failure.  TBB LOS >7L
   - lasix prn
   - I/O goal of -1000L today.
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process, toxic-metabolic, or hypoxia/increased WOB.  Would
   also consider other metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative.  TSH
   and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with treatment of
   pneumonia.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   trending down since admission.
   - trend LFTs
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - Continue digoxin, metoprolol with goal HR 80-100
   - Coumadin held in setting of INR > 3.0 with antibiotics, restarted on
   [**2142-6-16**]. Goal INR [**2-27**].
   # Mitral valve replacement:  Mechanical valve per report and history of
   rheumatic heart disease.
   - Daily INR, coumadin as above.
   FEN: TF, replete as necessary
   PPx: Coumadin with therapeutic INR

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is an  85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary
   HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR,
   HTN, who presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Pneumonia/sepsis:  At time of admission, met SIRS criteria with fever
   and tachycardia with pneumonia as infectious source.  Also considered
   abdominal process given recent surgery but no abdominal pain.  Chest CT
   suggests diffuse infiltrates and currently being covered with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
   - Cont vanc/ceftaz (day [**5-3**])
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  S/p trach after failing extubation
   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded during hospitalization after receiving IVFs but diuresed
   with good effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to
   respiratory failure.  TBB LOS >7L
   - lasix prn
   - I/O goal of -1000L today.
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process, toxic-metabolic, or hypoxia/increased WOB.  Would
   also consider other metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative.  TSH
   and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with treatment of
   pneumonia.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   trending down since admission.
   - trend LFTs
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - Continue digoxin, metoprolol with goal HR 80-100
   - Coumadin held in setting of INR > 3.0 with antibiotics, restarted on
   [**2142-6-16**]. Goal INR [**2-27**].
   # Mitral valve replacement:  Mechanical valve per report and history of
   rheumatic heart disease.
   - Daily INR, coumadin as above.
   FEN: TF, replete as necessary
   PPx: Coumadin with therapeutic INR

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

The patient, an 85-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of AMS and suspected sepsis. She has a history of CHF, pulmonary HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease, and mechanical MVR. She presents with tachypnea, O2 requirement increasing to 100% FM, and diffuse infiltrates on chest CT, suggesting healthcare-associated pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.2°C (97.2°F)
* Heart rate: 100 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 99/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 inspirations per minute (insp/min)
* SpO2: 97%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 13.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 256 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 42 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.7 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Calcium: 9.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.4 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Ceftriaxone
* Vancomycin
* Ceftazidime
* Lasix
* Digoxin
* Metoprolol
* Coumadin
* Nutren Pulmonary

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia
* Managing hypoxic respiratory failure with lasix and I/O goal of -1000 mL today
* Monitoring and treating altered mental status
* Trending liver function tests
* Managing atrial fibrillation with digoxin and metoprolol
* Restarting Coumadin with a goal INR of 2-3

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Liver dysfunction
* Renal dysfunction
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Infection-related changes in mental status
* Bleeding complications related to anticoagulation therapy

Based on the patient's current condition and laboratory results, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, and hepatic functions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has a history of rheumatic heart disease, mechanical mitral valve replacement, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and resolved sepsis presumed secondary to pneumonia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient appears more dyspneic today, with a respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 96% on a tracheal mask. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.26, which suggests that she may be retaining more CO2.
* Hemodynamics: The patient's blood pressure is 101/56 mmHg, with a heart rate of 92 beats per minute. Her central venous pressure is not assessed.
* Neurological: The patient's mental status is altered, with a decrease in alertness and interaction compared to the previous day. She nods her head to questions and has a negative head computed tomography (CT) scan.
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, with a platelet count of 256,000/uL. Her liver function tests show mild transaminitis, which is trending down since admission.

The patient's potential medical complications are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is increasing, and her oxygen saturation is decreasing. She may require more aggressive respiratory support, such as non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, which may worsen her respiratory failure. She requires continued empiric antibiotics and close monitoring for signs of worsening infection.
3. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis has resolved, but she may be at risk for recurrence. She requires close monitoring for signs of sepsis, such as fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may increase her risk of stroke and cardiac arrhythmias. She requires close monitoring and management with anticoagulation therapy.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis may be secondary to shock liver or another underlying condition. She requires close monitoring of her liver function tests and management with supportive care.
6. Mitral valve replacement: The patient's mechanical mitral valve replacement requires lifelong anticoagulation therapy to prevent thromboembolic events. She requires close monitoring for signs of bleeding or thrombosis.
7. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be secondary to her underlying medical conditions or medications. She requires close monitoring and management with supportive care.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including respiratory failure, pneumonia, sepsis, atrial fibrillation, transaminitis, mitral valve replacement, and altered mental status. She requires close monitoring and management with supportive care to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities and ongoing medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing worsening dyspnea, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.26, indicating respiratory acidosis. This suggests that the patient is not receiving adequate ventilation, and their condition is deteriorating.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 101/56 mmHg, indicating hypotension. This may be a sign of inadequate perfusion, and the patient may be at risk for organ damage if not addressed promptly.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a heart rhythm of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and increased risk of stroke.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating hypernatremia. This can cause dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is unresponsive and unable to provide a history, suggesting altered mental status. This may be due to the patient's underlying condition, medication, or other factors.
6. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and other complications.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
8. Nutritional Support: The patient is receiving enteral nutrition, which may be inadequate to meet their caloric needs.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure leading to respiratory arrest or cardiac arrest
2. Hypotension leading to organ damage, such as kidney or liver failure
3. Atrial fibrillation leading to stroke or cardiac arrest
4. Hypernatremia leading to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially life-threatening complications
5. Altered mental status leading to increased risk of falls, aspiration, or other complications
6. Pneumonia leading to sepsis, respiratory failure, or other complications
7. Coagulopathy leading to bleeding or thrombosis
8. Malnutrition leading to impaired immune function, wound healing, or other complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these complications and improve their outcome."

   Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is an  85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary
   HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR,
   HTN, who presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Pneumonia/sepsis:  At time of admission, met SIRS criteria with fever
   and tachycardia with pneumonia as infectious source.  Also considered
   abdominal process given recent surgery but no abdominal pain.  Chest CT
   suggests diffuse infiltrates and currently being covered with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
   - Cont vanc/ceftaz (day [**5-3**])
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  S/p trach after failing extubation
   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded during hospitalization after receiving IVFs but diuresed
   with good effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to
   respiratory failure.  TBB LOS >7L. Increased WOB today now back on NIV.
   - lasix gtt, goal TBB -1000 cc
   - Check ABG
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process, toxic-metabolic, or hypoxia/increased WOB.  Would
   also consider other metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative.  TSH
   and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with treatment of
   pneumonia.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   trending down since admission.
   - trend LFTs
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - Continue digoxin, metoprolol with goal HR 80-100
   - Coumadin held in setting of INR > 3.0 with antibiotics, restarted on
   [**2142-6-16**]. Goal INR [**2-27**].
   # Mitral valve replacement:  Mechanical valve per report and history of
   rheumatic heart disease.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is an 85-year-old female admitted to the ICU with CHF, pulmonary HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease, and s/p mechanical MVR. She presents with AMS, tachypnea, and question sepsis. The patient was previously treated for pneumonia and sepsis, and was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. She was weaned off invasive ventilation but required reintubation. The patient has been diagnosed with transaminitis, and her INR is subtherapeutic. She is receiving antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with AMS, tachypnea, and question sepsis suggests ongoing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of hypoxic respiratory failure and recent reintubation increases the risk of respiratory failure, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of CHF, pulmonary HTN, and atrial fib increases the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of abdominal surgery and recent antibiotic use increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's AMS and potential sepsis increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, encephalopathy, and stroke.
6. Hematological Complications: The patient's transaminitis and subtherapeutic INR increase the risk of bleeding and hematological complications.
7. Infection Control: The patient's history of pneumonia and sepsis increases the risk of further infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
8. Medication-Related Complications: The patient's use of multiple medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and cardiovascular medications, increases the risk of medication-related complications, such as adverse reactions, interactions, and overdose.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's condition, as well as the importance of coordinating care among the healthcare team to prevent and address these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is an  85 year-old female with CHF (right sided), pulmonary
   HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease s/p mechanical MVR, severe TR,
   HTN, who presents with AMS and question sepsis.
   # Pneumonia/sepsis:  At time of admission, met SIRS criteria with fever
   and tachycardia with pneumonia as infectious source.  Also considered
   abdominal process given recent surgery but no abdominal pain.  Chest CT
   suggests diffuse infiltrates and currently being covered with
   broad-spectrum antibiotics for healthcare-associated pneumonia.
   - Cont vanc/ceftaz (day [**6-2**]) for 7 day course
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  S/p trach after failing extubation
   during prior admission for small bowel obstruction.  Was volume
   overloaded during hospitalization after receiving IVFs but diuresed
   with good effect, now appears euvolemic.  Pneumonia contributing to
   respiratory failure.  TBB LOS >6L.  On mechanical ventilation as needed
   for resting.
   - lasix boluses prn
   # Altered mental status:  Unclear what patient's baseline is but per
   report she is alert and oriented x 3.  AMS likely secondary to
   infectious process, toxic-metabolic, or hypoxia/increased WOB.  Would
   also consider other metabolic causes of AMS.  Head CT negative.  TSH
   and B12 wnl, RPR neg.  Mental status now improved with treatment of
   pneumonia.
   - infectious disease management as above
   # Transaminitis:  No prior history of elevated LFTs or alcohol abuse.
   Elevated LFTs likely occured in setting of hypotension and shock liver,
   trending down since admission.
   - trend LFTs
   # S/p laparotomy:  Stable, no abdominal pain, no active issues,
   discussed with surgery.
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Previously on metoprolol but started on digoxin
   during [**Month (only) 230**]-[**2142-5-25**] hospitalization after cardiology consultation.
   Digoxin level normal at 1.7.  Ventricular rate in high 90s.  Restarted
   metoprolol on [**2142-6-14**].
   - Continue digoxin, metoprolol with goal HR 80-100
   - Coumadin held in setting of INR > 3.0 with antibiotics, restarted on
   [**2142-6-16**]. Goal INR [**2-27**].
   # Mitral valve replacement:  Mechanical valve per report and history of
   rheumatic heart disease.
   - Daily INR, coumadin as above.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **], is an 85-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including CHF (right-sided), pulmonary HTN, atrial fib, rheumatic heart disease, and a history of mechanical MVR with severe TR and HTN. She presents with AMS and question sepsis.

The patient's vital signs are:

* T-max: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
* T-current: 35.8°C (96.5°F)
* HR: 76 bpm (74-109 bpm)
* BP: 92/46 mmHg (58-110/70 mmHg)
* RR: 24 inspirations per minute (14-30 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 98%

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 237 mL (185-237 mL) and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. She is also receiving oxygen therapy with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 10.1-13.6 K/uL
* Hct: 25.0-28.9%
* Plt: 204-269 K/uL
* Cr: 0.9-1.0 mg/dL
* TCO2: 27-30 mmHg
* Glucose: 122-144 mg/dL
* Other lab results: PT/PTT/INR: 22.5/77.3/2.2, ALT/AST: 52/45, Alk Phos/T Bili: 308/0.5, Differential-Neuts: 86.6%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 6.4%, Mono: 5.7%, Eos: 0.8%, Lactic Acid: 0.7 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.7 g/dL, LDH: 222 IU/L, Ca++: 9.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 2.6 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Vancomycin: 750 mg every 12 hours
* Ceftazidime: 2 grams every 8 hours
* Heparin: 500 units every 6 hours
* Digoxin: 0.25 mg daily
* Metoprolol: 25 mg every 6 hours
* Lasix: 20 mg every 6 hours

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with AMS and question sepsis, along with her history of CHF and pulmonary HTN, makes sepsis a potential complication.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to her underlying pulmonary HTN and CHF, and her recent pneumonia may have contributed to her hypoxic respiratory failure.
3. Transaminitis: The patient's elevated LFTs may be related to her hypotension and shock liver, and it is essential to monitor her liver function tests closely.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may be related to her underlying heart disease, and it is essential to monitor her heart rate and rhythm closely.
5. Mitral valve replacement: The patient's mechanical MVR may increase her risk of bleeding and thrombosis, and it is essential to monitor her INR and coumadin levels closely.

In summary, Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] is an 85-year-old female with multiple comorbidities who presents with AMS and question sepsis. She requires close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and medications to manage her potential medical complications."
