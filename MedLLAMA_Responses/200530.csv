You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications are potential concerns:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but there is a risk of further drops due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or PE. The patient is receiving transfusions and IV fluids to maintain blood pressure.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient has a history of LUL collapse, LAD, and new bladder mass, which may be causing post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and may require further treatment for respiratory compromise.
3. Abdominal Pain: The patient has multiple new metastases, including omental, peritoneal, mesenteric, and retroperitoneal metastases, which may be causing abdominal pain. The patient is receiving low-dose morphine and tylenol for pain management.
4. Hematuria: The patient has a new bladder mass on CT scan and has had clots in their urine. They are receiving a 3-way foley catheter and will require urology consult for biopsy of the bladder mass.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be due to CLL or infection. The patient is receiving antibiotics and will require further evaluation to determine the cause of leukocytosis.
6. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has elevated bilirubin levels, which may be due to hemolysis or obstruction. The patient is receiving treatment for hyperbilirubinemia and will require further evaluation to determine the cause.
7. CLL: The patient has a history of CLL, which is now causing splenomegaly, new mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and a new bladder mass. The patient will require further evaluation and treatment for CLL.

The patient's current medications include:

* Levo/Flagyl for pneumonia
* Morphine for pain management
* Tylenol for pain management
* H2 blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.4°C
* Heart rate: 86 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 108/50 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.8 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 25.9%
* White blood cell count: 24.1 K/uL
* Platelet count: 26.3 K/uL
* Bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL

The patient's care plan includes:

* Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results
* Treatment for hypotension, respiratory compromise, and abdominal pain
* Further evaluation and treatment for CLL
* Monitoring of hyperbilirubinemia and leukocytosis
* Continued treatment for pneumonia and sepsis
* Consideration of further imaging studies, such as a chest CT, to better characterize lung pathology."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is a 85-year-old male with a history of CLL, presenting with hematuria, cough, and abdominal pain. The patient has undergone several procedures, including transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells, placement of an IVC filter, and insertion of a 3-way foley catheter. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 108/50 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor, diminished breath sounds on the left base, and distended and tender abdomen. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's creatinine level is stable, and the patient has been prescribed antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has dropped to 108/50 mmHg, which may be due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or PE. The patient has been prescribed fluids and vasopressors as needed.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%, but the patient has a history of PE and may have ongoing lung pathology. The patient has been prescribed oxygen therapy and a chest CT to better characterize lung pathology.
3. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is likely due to multiple new metastases, including omental, peritoneal, mesenteric, and retroperitoneal metastases. The patient has been prescribed pain medication and will be followed for trends in liver function tests.
4. Hematuria: The patient has a new bladder mass on CT scan and has had clots in urine. The patient has been prescribed a 3-way foley catheter and will be followed for evidence of CLL or TCC.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be due to CLL or infection. The patient has been prescribed antibiotics and will be discussed with a hematologist for further management.
6. Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's bilirubin level is elevated, which may be due to smoldering hemolysis in the setting of large tumor burden. The patient will be followed for trends in liver function tests and will have a re-fractionated bilirubin level.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continued antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medications as needed.
2. Further evaluation of lung pathology with a chest CT.
3. Follow-up for trends in liver function tests and bilirubin levels.
4. Continued pain management with low-dose morphine and tylenol.
5. Follow-up for evidence of CLL or TCC in the urine.
6. Discussion with a hematologist for further management of CLL.
7. Transfer to the floor if the patient's HCT is stable."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old Russian female with a history of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), presenting with hematuria, cough, and abdominal pain. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 108/50 mmHg, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with no changes in oxygenation or ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual with no acute distress. The patient has conjunctiva pale, non-reactive, and surgical pupils. The patient's cardiovascular examination is normal, with symmetric expansion and diminished breath sounds on the left base.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 24.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 222 K/uL. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine are within normal limits. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels.

The patient's medical history includes CLL, asthma, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. The patient has a history of smoking and has a family history of cancer.

The patient's current medications include levothyroxine, flagyl, and morphine. The patient is also receiving prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, and the patient is not in shock. The patient's hypotension is likely due to medication or sepsis.
* Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is stable, and the patient is not showing signs of respiratory distress.
* Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is likely due to metastatic disease or obstruction.
* Hematuria: The patient's hematuria is likely due to bladder cancer or other underlying medical condition.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to CLL or infection.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and leukocytosis may indicate the presence of sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory rate may indicate the presence of respiratory failure.
* Cardiac failure: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate the presence of cardiac failure.
* Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is low, and the patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
* Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated bilirubin levels may indicate the presence of infection.
* Metastatic disease: The patient's abdominal pain and hematuria may indicate the presence of metastatic disease.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results
* Administration of antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy
* Management of abdominal pain with pain medication and hydration
* Monitoring of hematuria and leukocytosis
* Consideration of biopsy and further diagnostic testing
* Management of CLL with chemotherapy and supportive care
* Management of hyperbilirubinemia with fractionation and treatment of underlying cause."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo F w/ CLL presents with hematuria, abd pain and transient
   hypotension in ED,  found to have extensive masses throughout abd and
   pelvis/bladder concerning for widely metastatic disease of unclear
   primary , also with evidence of partial LLL collapse and PE
   Main issues remain:
   # Hypoxia
remains stable on 2L NC
          # PE--stable from hemodynamic and respiratory standpoint and
   feel is high risk for anticoagulation given extensive bladder mass and
   hematuria w/ recent h/h drop
           Had IVC filter placed yesterday and remains on dvt prophy with
   sc heparin
           Echo to assess RV fx
          #? post-obstructive pna--f/u ct chest (noncontrast) to further
   asses lung involvement and evaluate LLL, though without contrast
   evaluation of mediastinal LN is limited, also most likely from CLL, may
   identify bx-able lesion, though again if concern for transformation of
   CLL fna less helpful at making dx
          continue empiric antbx with levo flagyl, broadening coverage if
   worsening respiratory or clinical status
       # Cough
add tessalon perles, robitussion, flovent and consider
   codeine
   #CLL/malignancy
now with widely metastatic cancer,  primary site
   unclear
some findings likely secondary to known CLL, with possibility
   of transformation (Richters) though bladder mass seems less c/w this
   picture --? Bladder, breast, renal cell ca,
         Continue toward obtaining dx--tissue/cytologic--urology c/s and
   onc input, appreciated,  urine for cytology, given high risk for
   resection for uncontrolled bleeding.
         Chest ct to further eval for lung involvement  as above
         # anemia--hct below baseline and will follow, now post 1-unit
   prbc's w/ appropriate  bump,
                 hemolysis contributing
starting folate and holding on
   prednisone pending tissue dx as this could interfere
         # uric acid elevation--etiology unclear but question of tumor
   lysis, renal fx remains stable and other lytes stable, continue
   hydration and  follow tumor lysis labs
         # LFT s
trend
   #  Transient hypotension
now resolved
        most likely secondary to combination of medication effect from
   morphine  and hypovolemia , less likely d/t PE and/or sepsis/infection
       remains stable hemodynamically
       h/h with expected bump post transfusion, continuing to monitor
       f/u cx
s  and continue empiric antibx with levo flagyl

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) who presented to the emergency department with hematuria, abdominal pain, and transient hypotension. She has extensive masses throughout her abdomen and pelvis, concerning for widely metastatic disease of unclear primary origin. She also has evidence of partial left lower lobe collapse and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's main issues include hypoxia, PE, post-obstructive pneumonia, cough, CLL/malignancy, anemia, uric acid elevation, LFT trends, transient hypotension, leukocytosis, abdominal pain, hematuria, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%, but she has a history of partial left lower lobe collapse and PE, which could worsen her respiratory status.
2. Hematuria: The patient's hematuria is ongoing, and there is a risk of bleeding complications if the bladder mass is not managed properly.
3. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain is likely secondary to the extensive masses throughout her abdomen, which could lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.8 g/dL, which is below baseline, and she has received one unit of packed red blood cells. Further transfusions may be necessary to manage her anemia.
5. Uric acid elevation: The patient's uric acid level is elevated, which could be secondary to tumor lysis or renal dysfunction. Monitoring her uric acid levels and managing her hydration status is crucial to prevent complications.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, which could be secondary to her CLL or infection. Monitoring her white blood cell count and following up with infection work-up is necessary to determine the cause of her leukocytosis.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to her PE and partial left lower lobe collapse. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and management of her respiratory complications is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
8. Sepsis: The patient's history of transient hypotension and leukocytosis increases her risk of developing sepsis. Close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory values is necessary to detect early signs of sepsis.

Based on the patient's condition, it is crucial to continue monitoring her closely and managing her symptoms appropriately to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) who presented to the emergency department with hematuria, transient hypotension, and abdominal pain. The patient has extensive masses throughout the abdomen and pelvis/bladder, concerning for widely metastatic disease of unclear primary.

The patient's main issues remain:

1. Transient hypotension: likely secondary to medication effect from morphine and hypovolemia, which has resolved.
2. Hypoxia: stable from a hemodynamic and respiratory standpoint, with a high risk for anticoagulation given the extensive masses and hematuria.
3. Post-obstructive pneumonia: stable on 2 L NC, with a follow-up CT chest to further assess lung involvement.
4. CLL/malignancy: widely metastatic cancer with an unclear primary site, possibly bladder, breast, or renal cell cancer.
5. Anemia: hct below baseline, likely due to low-level hemolysis, and will be followed with further transfusions.
6. Uric acid elevation: etiology unclear, possibly due to tumor lysis, with renal function remaining stable.
7. LFT abnormalities: elevated T-bili-DAT pending, with a habitus < 20, and a check smear ordered.
8. Leukocytosis: difficult to interpret in the setting of CLL, trending down towards prior baseline.
9. Abdominal pain: multiple masses throughout the abdomen, likely etiology, with empiric antibiotics and pain control with morphine.
10. Hematuria: TWF, with good urine output without clot, not requiring urine irrigation.
11. HTN: holding home meds given hypotension in the ED.

The patient has undergone the following interventions:

* Received 1 unit of PRBC with an appropriate bump
* IVC filter placed
* Abd pain controlled with low-dose morphine
* Infusions of ranitidine (prophylaxis) and other ICU medications
* Empiric antibiotics with levo flagyl
* Chest CT ordered
* Urology consult and oncology input planned
* Discussion with radiology regarding possible CT-guided FNA based on CT findings

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis or infection from urine, post-obstructive pneumonia, or other sources
* Tumor lysis syndrome
* Renal failure
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac complications from anticoagulation
* Hemorrhage from the IVC filter
* Infection or sepsis from the urinary tract or other sources
* Progression of the CLL or metastatic disease
* Development of new medical conditions, such as hypertension, asthma, or anemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   85F russian, CLL, presenting with cough, abd pain, and hematuria, found
   to have LUL collapse [**1-6**] LAD, multiple abdominal mets, and new bladder
   mass.
   .
   # hypotension - resolving, ddx includes hypovolemia (blood loss,
   dehydration) vs sepsis vs PE vs [**1-6**] morphine. ANC > 1000, thus atypical
   infxns unlikely.  feel more likely medication vs sepsis. BP stable
   presently, low 100s, mentating well, well perfused.
   - follow UOP, prn bolus for UOP <30cc/hr (EF >55%).
   - T&S.
   - serial HCT for today, q8h.
   - f/u bcx, ucx, consider sputum cx.
   - continue levo/flagyl for now, consider broadening for
   post-obstructive cvg only if looks ill.
   - LENIs to consider IVC filter, consider CTA, as would be useful to
   better characterize thoracic lymphadenopathy in terms best site for
   biopsy.
   - ?heparin, consider hold off on anticoag for now given stable
   respiratory status, and ?hemodynamically significant bleeding.
   - upon further discussion, and repeat HCT falling, will place IVC
   filter and hold off on  heparin for now.
   .
   .
   # hypoxia - +cough, new LLL collapse likely 2/2 L hilar lymphadenopathy
   with resulting post-obstructive colapse, +LLL effusion, ?RLL increased
   opacification, also ?contribution from RLL PE (?old), not completely
   characterized on CT ABD/PELVIS. no EKG changes concerning for MI, no
   evidence of CHF.  currently on 2L O2, breathing comfortably.
   - CTA to characterize PE, also to characterize thoracic lymphadenoapthy
   and metastasis with regard to potential biopsy sites.
   - continue levo/flagyl, broaden if looks ill.
   - consider heparin gtt after CTA, hematuria stable presently
   - check sputum cx.
   .
   .
   # abdominal pain - multiple new omental, peritoneal, mesenteric, and
   retroperitoneal metastases, GE jxn mass, LUQ mass, primary unclear
   (bladder vs ovarian, though s/p tah/bso), concerning for new metastatic
   malignancy. also increased splenomegaly.  elevated tbil (2.1), though
   AP normal, could be [**1-6**]  hemolysis, no liver lesions on CT.
   - obtain tissue -> will biopsy bladder mass in AM.
   - trend LFTs, no evidence of bil dil on CT, consider RUQ USN if
   trending up.
   - tylenol, ultram prn for abd pain, would use 0.5-1mg morphine for abd
   pain if needed, though would be cautious given BP drop in ED.
   - hyperbilirubinemia may be [**1-6**] hemolysis, no biliary dilation on CT,
   no RUQ pain.
   - fractionate bilirubin.
   .

   # hematuria - new bladder mass on CT scan, 400cc UOP in ED, ~100-200cc
   on arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**].  has had clots in urine per pt.  creatinine
   stable.
   - place 3 way foley.
   - continuous bladder irrigation.
   - urology consult re biopsy of bladder mass.
   - hold aspirin.
   - cycle hct q8hr today.
   .
   .
   # leukocytosis - likely [**1-6**] CLL vs infection.
   - treat with abx as above, discuss plan for CLL with heme-onc.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   AP normal, could be [**1-6**]  hemolysis, no liver lesions on CT.
   - obtain tissue -> will biopsy bladder mass in AM.
   - trend LFTs, no evidence of bil dil on CT, consider RUQ USN if
   trending up.
   - tylenol, ultram prn for abd pain, would use 0.5-1mg morphine for abd
   pain if needed, though would be cautious given BP drop in ED.
   - hyperbilirubinemia may be [**1-6**] hemolysis, no biliary dilation on CT,
   no RUQ pain.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old Russian male with a history of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), presenting with cough, abdominal pain, and hematuria. The patient has undergone a series of tests and evaluations, including a trans-thoracic echo, CT scan of the chest, and laboratory tests.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has a mild cough and is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% and the ABG results show a pH of 7.30, PCO2 of 30 mmHg, and PO2 of 60 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 87 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 95/50 mmHg.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has abdominal pain and distension, and is at risk for bowel obstruction.
* Renal: The patient has hematuria and is at risk for acute kidney injury.
* Hematological: The patient has leukocytosis and is at risk for infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 97%, but the ABG results show a pH of 7.30, which may indicate respiratory acidosis.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient's blood pressure is 95/50 mmHg, which may indicate hypotension.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has abdominal pain and distension, and is at risk for bowel obstruction, which may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Renal failure: The patient has hematuria and is at risk for acute kidney injury, which may lead to renal failure.
* Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and is at risk for infection, which may lead to sepsis.
* Malignancy progression: The patient has a history of CLL and has new mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which may indicate progression of the disease.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for pneumonia
* Pain management for abdominal pain
* Bladder irrigation for hematuria
* Continuous bladder irrigation
* Urology consult for biopsy of bladder mass
* Heme/onc consult for CLL management
* Fractionate bilirubin, check haptoglobin, LDH, platelets smear, and DAT
* D/W team best site for tissue biopsy
* Continue gentle IVF hydration and follow uric acid, phosphorus, and calcium levels.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:
   85F russian, CLL, presenting with cough, abd pain, and hematuria, found
   to have LUL collapse [**1-6**] LAD, multiple abdominal mets, and new bladder
   mass.

   # hypotension - resolving, ddx includes hypovolemia (blood loss,
   dehydration) vs sepsis vs PE vs [**1-6**] morphine. ANC > 1000, thus atypical
   infxns unlikely.  feel more likely medication vs sepsis. BP stable
   presently, low 100s, mentating well, well perfused.
   - follow UOP, prn bolus for UOP <30cc/hr (EF >55%).
   - T&S.
   - serial HCT for today, q8h.
   - f/u bcx, ucx, consider sputum cx.
   - continue levo/flagyl for now, consider broadening for
   post-obstructive cvg only if looks ill.
   - LENIs to consider IVC filter, consider CTA, as would be useful to
   better characterize thoracic lymphadenopathy in terms best site for
   biopsy.
   - ?heparin, consider hold off on anticoag for now given stable
   respiratory status, and ?hemodynamically significant bleeding.
   - upon further discussion, and repeat HCT falling, will place IVC
   filter and hold off on  heparin for now.

   # hypoxia - +cough, new LLL collapse likely 2/2 L hilar lymphadenopathy
   with resulting post-obstructive colapse, +LLL effusion, ?RLL increased
   opacification, also ?contribution from RLL PE (?old), not completely
   characterized on CT ABD/PELVIS. no EKG changes concerning for MI, no
   evidence of CHF.  currently on 2L O2, breathing comfortably.
   - CTA to characterize PE, also to characterize thoracic lymphadenoapthy
   and metastasis with regard to potential biopsy sites.
   - continue levo/flagyl, broaden if looks ill.
   - consider heparin gtt after CTA, hematuria stable presently
   - check sputum cx.
   .
   .
   # abdominal pain - multiple new omental, peritoneal, mesenteric, and
   retroperitoneal metastases, GE jxn mass, LUQ mass, primary unclear
   (bladder vs ovarian, though s/p tah/bso), concerning for new metastatic
   malignancy. also increased splenomegaly.  elevated tbil (2.1), though
   AP normal, could be [**1-6**]  hemolysis, no liver lesions on CT.
   - obtain tissue -> will biopsy bladder mass in AM.
   - trend LFTs, no evidence of bil dil on CT, consider RUQ USN if
   trending up.
   - tylenol, ultram prn for abd pain, would use 0.5-1mg morphine for abd
   pain if needed, though would be cautious given BP drop in ED.
   - hyperbilirubinemia may be [**1-6**] hemolysis, no biliary dilation on CT,
   no RUQ pain.
   - fractionate bilirubin.
   .

   # hematuria - new bladder mass on CT scan, 400cc UOP in ED, ~100-200cc
   on arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**].  has had clots in urine per pt.  creatinine
   stable.
   - place 3 way foley.
   - continuous bladder irrigation.
   - urology consult re biopsy of bladder mass.
   - hold aspirin.
   - cycle hct q8hr today.
   .
   .
   # leukocytosis - likely [**1-6**] CLL vs infection.
   - treat with abx as above, discuss plan for CLL with heme-onc.

   - heme/onc consult.
   - fractionate bilirubin, check haptoglobin, LDH, platelets smear, DAT
   - d/w team best site for tissue biopsy.
   - elevated uric acid, ?tumor lysis-> will continue gentle IVF

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 85-year-old male with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who presented with hematuria, abdominal pain, and cough. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including CLL, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma, and osteoarthritis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is 95/50 mmHg, and his heart rate is 87 bpm. His respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 97% on a nasal cannula.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula.
* Abdominal pain: The patient has multiple abdominal metastases, including omental, peritoneal, mesenteric, and retroperitoneal metastases. He also has a GE junction mass and a LUQ mass, which are concerning for new metastatic malignancy.
* Hematuria: The patient has a new bladder mass on CT scan, and he has had clots in his urine. He has a 3-way foley catheter in place, and he is receiving continuous bladder irrigation.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is 26.3 K/uL, which is likely due to his CLL or infection.
* Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's bilirubin level is 2.1 mg/dL, which is concerning for hemolysis. However, his liver function tests are normal, and he does not have any evidence of biliary dilation on CT scan.
* CLL: The patient has a history of CLL, and his baseline hematocrit is 35-36%. His platelet count is 200s, and his splenomegaly is increased. He has new mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a new bladder mass.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and hyperbilirubinemia may be due to infection.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, and his CT scan shows moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
* Hemolytic anemia: The patient's hyperbilirubinemia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level may be due to hemolysis.
* Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient's elevated uric acid level and hyperbilirubinemia may be due to tumor lysis syndrome.
* Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is 200s, which is low. He also has a history of bleeding, including hematuria.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Antibiotics: The patient is receiving antibiotics for his suspected infection.
* Pain management: The patient is receiving pain medication for his abdominal pain and hematuria.
* Urology consult: The patient has a urology consult for a biopsy of his bladder mass.
* Heme/onc consult: The patient has a heme/onc consult for his CLL and hyperbilirubinemia.
* CTA: The patient has a CTA to characterize his pulmonary embolism and to identify potential biopsy sites.
* IVC filter: The patient has an IVC filter placed to prevent pulmonary embolism.
* Heparin: The patient is receiving heparin therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
* Continuous bladder irrigation: The patient is receiving continuous bladder irrigation to manage his hematuria.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and he requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical conditions."
