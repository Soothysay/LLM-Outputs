You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old admission to the ICU with a history of cancer and pulmonary edema. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, and blood pressure of 137/60 mmHg. The patient is receiving furosemide (Lasix) and other medications, including antibiotics. The patient's respiratory support includes a non-rebreather oxygen delivery device with an SpO2 of 95%. The patient's laboratory results show mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and tachypnea (51 breaths per minute) increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's cancer history and elevated white blood cell count (33.1) increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia (21 platelets) increases the risk of bleeding.
4. Liver failure: The patient's elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) increase the risk of liver failure.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte results show mild abnormalities, including hypokalemia (28 mEq/L) and hypophosphatemia (0.8 mg/dL), which may require close monitoring and treatment.
6. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated (0.9 mg/dL), which may indicate early signs of renal failure.
7. Infection: The patient's history of cancer and immunosuppression increase the risk of infection, particularly pneumonia or bloodstream infection.
8. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus tachycardia (102 bpm) may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o woman with metastatic melanoma who is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] from
   the OMED biologics service due to respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient currently satting well on
   non-rebreather but has a high A-a gradient.  Differential includes
   pulmonary edema, systolic heart failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary
   embolism, but most likely etiology is pulmonary edema from vasogenic
   leak, a known complication of IL-2 therapy.  Initially was diuresed
   aggressively but now with metabolic contraction alkolosis on [**2110-1-21**].
   - continue to follow ABGs
   - consider chest CTA if hypoxia does not resolve but no empiric
   anticoagulation given thrombocytopenia
   - consider lasix bolus if CVP increases
   # Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 51**] represent chemo affect but also concerning for
   infection.
   - pan cx (blood, urine)
   - send c diff
   - continue vanc and zosyn until blood cx negative x 72 hours
   - will d/c cephalexin (given by Heme/onc service as CVL infection ppx)
   but restart when vanc stopped
   # Elevated LFTs:  Likely secondary to IL-2 as this is a known adverse
   effect.  Trending down after peaking on [**2110-1-18**].  Other possibilities
   include viral hepatitis and cholecystitis.
   - check RUQ U/S
   - continue to trend and consider further ID evaluation if indicated
   # RLE edema: Has been persistent since [**2109-11-11**] and was actually
   patient's presenting symptom at the time of work-up for recurrent
   melanoma.  Likely secondary to pelvic compression of iliac vein from
   pelvic metastatic masses but should r/o DVT.
   - LENIs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient currently satting well on

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. She was previously treated with IL-2 therapy, which is a known cause of vasogenic leak and pulmonary edema. She is currently receiving non-invasive ventilation and has a high A-a gradient. Her lab results show leukocytosis, elevated liver function tests, and thrombocytopenia. She also has a history of depression, anxiety, and smoking. Her current medications include furosemide, lorazepam, and oxycodone.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's high A-a gradient and pulmonary edema increase her risk of hypoxic respiratory failure, which could lead to respiratory arrest and death.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated liver function tests may indicate an underlying infection, which could spread to other parts of the body and cause sepsis.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases her risk of bleeding, particularly in the context of invasive procedures or trauma.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of pelvic compression and edema increases her risk of pulmonary embolism, which could be life-threatening.
5. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's metastatic melanoma may continue to progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's high caloric needs and potential malabsorption due to her disease and treatment may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which could exacerbate her condition.
7. Depression and anxiety: The patient's history of depression and anxiety may worsen during her hospitalization, leading to decreased quality of life and potential complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her ventilation settings as needed.
2. Consider a chest CTA to rule out pulmonary embolism.
3. Continue to treat the patient's infection with antibiotics and monitor her response.
4. Consider a platelet transfusion to increase the patient's platelet count.
5. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust her platelet transfusion schedule as needed.
6. Consider a nutritional consult to optimize the patient's nutrition and prevent deficiencies.
7. Monitor the patient's mental health and consider referring her to a mental health professional if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. She was previously treated with IL-2 therapy, which caused vasogenic leak and pulmonary edema. She is currently on non-rebreather oxygen therapy and has a high A-a gradient. Her vital signs are stable, but she has leukocytosis, elevated LFTs, and RLE edema. She has a history of melanoma on her left thigh and received IL-2 therapy, which was discontinued due to peripheral neuropathy. She is also experiencing depression, anxiety, and chronic pain.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further due to pulmonary edema and vasogenic leak. Monitoring of ABGs and consideration of lasix bolus may be necessary to manage her respiratory status.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may be secondary to chemo affect or infection. Pan-cx (blood, urine) and c diff testing may be necessary to rule out infection.
3. Hepatic toxicity: The patient's elevated LFTs may be secondary to IL-2 therapy. Further ID evaluation may be necessary if the LFTs do not trend down.
4. RLE edema: The patient's RLE edema may worsen if not managed properly. Monitoring of the edema and consideration of further treatment may be necessary.
5. Melanoma progression: The patient's melanoma may progress despite treatment. Further management by the hematology oncology service may be necessary.
6. Depression and anxiety: The patient's depression and anxiety may worsen if not managed properly. Continuation of home meds and consideration of further therapy may be necessary.
7. Pain control: The patient's chronic pain may worsen if not managed properly. Continuation of oxycodone and consideration of further therapy may be necessary.
8. DVT and VAP: The patient is at risk for DVT and VAP due to her immobility and respiratory therapy. Prophylaxis measures such as pneumoboots and pantoprazole may be necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o woman with metastatic melanoma who is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] from
   the OMED biologics service due to respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient currently satting well on
   non-rebreather but has a high A-a gradient.  Differential includes
   pulmonary edema, systolic heart failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary
   embolism among other etiologies.  IL-2 associated with pulmonary edema
   [**1-13**] vasogenic leakage but can also be cardiotoxic.   Patient also
   received lasix on the floor with good UOP.
   - check ABG
   - check ECHO
   - consider chest CTA but no empiric anticoagulation given
   thrombocytopenia
   - consider LENIs
   - diuresis with lasix
   # Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 51**] represent chemo affect but also concerning for
   infection.
   - pan cx (blood, urine)
   - send c diff
   - continue cephalexin until indication for tx with this antibiotic is

   # Elevated LFTs:  Likely secondary to IL-2 as this is a known adverse
   effect.  Trending down after peaking on [**2110-1-18**].  Other possibilities
   include viral hepatitis and cholecystitis.
   - check RUQ U/S

   # RLE edema: Has been persistent since [**2109-11-11**] and was actually
   patient's presenting symptom at the time of work-up for recurrent
   melanoma.  Likely secondary to pelvic compression of iliac vein from
   pelvic metastatic masses but should r/o DVT.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 53-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. She was previously treated with IL-2 and has a history of recurrent melanoma. She is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has been intermittently tiring and recovering. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.7Â°F, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 119/57 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on a non-rebreather mask.

The patient has a high A-a gradient and is at risk for hypoxic respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes pulmonary edema, systolic heart failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism. She has also been treated with Lasix and has good urine output.

The patient has leukocytosis, which may be secondary to chemotherapy or infection. She has elevated LFTs, which may be secondary to IL-2 or other causes. She has RLE edema, which may be secondary to pelvic compression of the iliac vein or DVT.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's high A-a gradient and risk of pulmonary edema, systolic heart failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism make her at risk for hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated LFTs may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen her respiratory status.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's high A-a gradient and risk of pulmonary edema make her at risk for developing pulmonary edema.
4. Systolic heart failure: The patient's high A-a gradient and risk of systolic heart failure make her at risk for developing systolic heart failure.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's high A-a gradient and risk of pneumonia make her at risk for developing pneumonia.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's high A-a gradient and risk of pulmonary embolism make her at risk for developing pulmonary embolism.
7. DVT: The patient's RLE edema and risk of DVT make her at risk for developing DVT.
8. Cholecystitis: The patient's elevated LFTs may indicate cholecystitis, which could worsen her respiratory status.
9. Viral hepatitis: The patient's elevated LFTs may indicate viral hepatitis, which could worsen her respiratory status.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and ventilator settings to ensure adequate oxygenation.
2. Consider performing a chest CT scan to rule out pulmonary embolism and other causes of hypoxic respiratory failure.
3. Consider empiric anticoagulation to prevent DVT.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's LFTs and consider further evaluation if indicated.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's urine output and consider further evaluation if indicated.
6. Consider further evaluation of the patient's RLE edema to rule out DVT.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and adjust therapy as needed.
8. Consider further evaluation of the patient's depression and anxiety to ensure adequate management.
9. Consider further evaluation of the patient's pain control to ensure adequate management.
10. Consider further evaluation of the patient's smoking history to ensure adequate management."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 y/o woman with metastatic melanoma who is admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] from
   the OMED biologics service due to respiratory distress.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Patient currently satting well on
   non-rebreather but has a high A-a gradient secondary to pulmonary edema
   from vasogenic leak, a known complication of IL-2 therapy.  Other less
   likely possiblities include pna and PE.  Initially was diuresed
   aggressively but now with metabolic contraction alkolosis on [**2110-1-21**].
   - continue to follow ABGs
   - continue non-rebreather
   - consider lasix bolus if CVP increases
   - continue vanc/zosyn for now
   - anticipate that respiratory status will gradually improve with time
   # Leukocytosis:  [**Month (only) 51**] represent chemo affect but also concerning for
   infection.
   - pan cx (blood, urine)
   - send c diff
   - continue vanc and zosyn until blood cx negative x 72 hours
   - will d/c cephalexin (given by Heme/onc service as CVL infection ppx)
   but restart when vanc stopped
   # Elevated LFTs:  Likely secondary to IL-2 as this is a known adverse
   effect.  Trending down after peaking on [**2110-1-18**].  Negative RUQ U/S on
   [**2110-1-20**].
   - continue to trend and consider further ID evaluation if indicated
   # RLE edema: Has been persistent since [**2109-11-11**] and was actually
   patient's presenting symptom at the time of work-up for recurrent
   melanoma.  Secondary to pelvic compression of iliac vein from pelvic
   metastatic masses.  No DVT on LENIs.
   - continue to follow
   # Melanoma:  Initially had melanoma on left thigh in [**2105**] and again in
   [**2106**]; excised both times.  Received IFN-alpha after first melanoma but
   d/c'd because of peripheral neuropathy.  S/p IL-2 with last dose on

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress. The patient has a history of melanoma on the left thigh, which was excised twice, and received interferon-alpha after the first melanoma but discontinued due to peripheral neuropathy. The patient is currently undergoing IL-2 therapy.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Respiratory failure due to hypoxia and pulmonary edema secondary to vasogenic leak, a known complication of IL-2 therapy.
* Leukocytosis, which may be secondary to chemo affect or infection.
* Elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which may be secondary to IL-2 therapy.
* Right lower extremity (RLE) edema, which is persistent and may be secondary to pelvic compression of the iliac vein from pelvic metastatic masses.
* Metabolic alkalosis, which is a complication of IL-2 therapy.

The patient is currently receiving:

* Non-rebreather oxygen therapy
* Vasopressors (Vanc/Zosyn) for treatment of hypotension
* Diuretics (Lasix) for treatment of pulmonary edema
* Pain management with oxycodone
* Antidepressant medication for depression/anxiety
* Nicotine patch for smoking cessation
* Regular diet

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC) 30.7, which is elevated
* Hemoglobin (Hb) 8.6 g/dL, which is decreased
* Platelet count (Plt) 21, which is decreased
* Creatinine (Cr) 0.8 mg/dL, which is within normal range
* Troponin-T <0.01, which is normal
* Lactic acid 1.2 mmol/L, which is normal
* Albumin 2.9 g/dL, which is normal
* LDH 531 IU/L, which is elevated
* Calcium 7.9 mg/dL, which is within normal range
* Magnesium 2.4 mg/dL, which is within normal range
* Phosphate 3.5 mg/dL, which is within normal range

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to worsening hypoxia and pulmonary edema
* Infection secondary to leukocytosis
* Hepatic dysfunction secondary to elevated LFTs
* Venous thromboembolism (VTE) secondary to RLE edema
* Metabolic alkalosis secondary to IL-2 therapy
* Pulmonary edema secondary to vasogenic leak

Based on the patient's condition and laboratory results, it is recommended to continue monitoring the patient's respiratory status, leukocytosis, and liver function tests, and to consider further evaluation and management of the patient's RLE edema and VTE risk."
