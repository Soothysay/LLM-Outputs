   Assessment and Plan
   64F h/o MDS presenting with new AML now s/p 7+3 induction, had residual
   blasts in day 14 BM, now completed HDAC reinduction day +44. Hospital
   course c/b persistent neutropenia and now sepsis physiology. Today
   developped worsening tachypnea with increased O2 requirements
   .
   #) Hypoxia: Has bil;ateral patchy infiltrates, in setting of
   neutropenia and fevers most consistent with a multifocal pneumonia.
   Oxygenation did not improve after thoracentesis on [**5-11**], and BAL on
   [**5-4**] is also negative. The gram stain from BAL and thoracentesis are
   also negative.  Other considerations include pulmonary edema, though
   oxygenation did not improve wioth diuresis. CXR s/p thoracentesis show
   cleared pleural effusuion and no pneumothorax. PE is a consideration
   considering history of malignancy, and echo on [**5-3**] showing interval
   worsening of pulmonary hypertension and tricuspid regurgitation.  ARDS
   or acute lung injury also a consideration with PaO2/FiO2 265.
   - titrate supplemental O2 to Sats > 90%
   - cont broad spectrum antibiotic coverage for likely multifocal
   pneumonia
   - EKG and CE to r/o ischemia
   .
   #Hypotension: in setting of fevers, patient meets SIRS criteria with
   likely infectious source being multifocal pneumonia.  Currently fluid
   responsive with increased BP to 117/61 after only 500cc NS.  Over
   diuresis is also a consideration but ins and outs have been inaccurate.
   -fluids for MAP > 65
   -levophed if fluids unresponsive
   -ekg, cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # Somnolence: in setting of hypotension and hypoxia and has resolved
   with improved BP and ooxygenation.
   -monitor
   -check lytes
   -low threshold for CT as she presented with a small intracranial bleed.
   .
   #) Fever: Peristent fevers most likely infectious etiology given
   profound neutropenia although drug fever also possibility. Most likely
   source continues to be multifocal pneumonia, although would also
   consider line infection. Also at risk of opportunistic infection with
   disseminated fungus. Infectious eval continues to be negative- only
   positive culture VRE in urine not from clean catch.
   - cont linezolid/ meropenem/ ambisome/ flagyl
   - f/u infectious evaluation with blood/ urine/ sputum cultures
   - trend WBC and fever curve
   - ID recs
   - consider adding bactrim or aminoglycoside if patient decompensates
   further
   .
   #)Lower extremity weakness: [**Month (only) 11**] be deconditioing vs. new central
   process, Also with new bladder and bowel incontinence.  patient
   presented with new frontal hypodensity that was subacute in nature
   attriibuted to leukostasis.  Exam is positive for right sided upper and
   lower extremity weakness which has been unchanged since admission.
   -Neuro consult
   -repeat imaging per neuro.
   -repeat UA
   .
   #) AML: s/p induction 7+3 [**3-5**] and reinduction HiDac [**3-25**] chemotherapy,
   Day +44. still with profound neutropenia with no evidence of bone
   marrow recovery. Neupogen has been discontinued as not effective and
   could be contributing to febrile episodes
   - trend CBC w/ diff
   - supportive transfusions for Hct < 25, plt < 10
   - if infectious issues resolve, pt would be candidate for transplant
   .
   #) Tachyarrhthymia: Repeat episodes of SVT likely AVNRT driven by high
   metabolic demands. HR better controlled with B-blockade
   - monitor on tele
   - continue B-blockade and CCB to maintain HR in 80s- 100s as BP will
   tolerate
   - treat infection as above
   .
   #) Elevated alkaline phosphatase: elevated transaminitis developped
   after patient briefly placed on daptomycin and voriconazole. Although
   rest of LFTs have trended down, ALP remains elevated. CT scan w/o
   contrast showed no abnormalities
   - monitor serial abdominal exams
   - consider abdominal US

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) who has developed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) after completing 7+3 induction chemotherapy and reinduction HiDac chemotherapy. She has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of sepsis, multifocal pneumonia, and hypotension.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 37.8°C, Tcurrent 37.8°C, HR 108 bpm, BP 120/61 mmHg, RR 24 inspirations per minute, SpO2 93%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is fluid-responsive, with an increase in BP to 117/61 mmHg after receiving a 500cc bolus of normal saline.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,491 mL of fluid and has lost 790 mL of urine and 665 mL of blood products.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy with an aerosol-cool device, with a SpO2 of 93%.
* Neurologic status: The patient is somnolent and has a history of a small intracranial bleed, with a pending CT scan to assess for any changes.
* Laboratory results: The patient has a white blood cell count of 23 K/uL, a platelet count of 44, and a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL.
* Imaging studies: The patient has a partially imaged right pleural effusion and benign hepatic cysts in the liver.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Hypoxia: The patient has bilateral patchy infiltrates and is at risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute lung injury.
* Hypotension: The patient has a history of fevers and is at risk of developing septic shock.
* Sepsis: The patient has a diagnosis of sepsis and is at risk of developing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
* Pulmonary edema: The patient has a history of malignancy and is at risk of developing pulmonary edema.
* Leukostasis: The patient has a history of leukostasis and is at risk of developing cerebral edema.
* Central nervous system (CNS) complications: The patient has a history of a small intracranial bleed and is at risk of developing CNS complications such as seizures or cerebral edema.
* Infectious complications: The patient has a diagnosis of multifocal pneumonia and is at risk of developing other infectious complications such as line infections or opportunistic infections.

Based on the patient's condition, the physician's plan is to:

* Titrate supplemental oxygen to maintain a SpO2 of >90%.
* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for likely multifocal pneumonia.
* Monitor for signs of ischemia and consider EKG and CE studies.
* Manage hypotension with fluids and levophed as needed.
* Monitor for signs of somnolence and consider CT scan to assess for any changes in the brain.
* Continue antifungal and antibacterial therapy for the patient's multifocal pneumonia.
* Monitor for signs of lower extremity weakness and consider neurology consult.
* Continue supportive care for the patient's AML, including transfusions and antibiotics as needed.
* Monitor for signs of tachyarrhythmia and continue beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker therapy as needed.
* Monitor for signs of elevated alkaline phosphatase and consider abdominal US or CT scan to assess for any changes in the liver."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presented with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after completing 7+3 induction chemotherapy. She developed persistent neutropenia, sepsis physiology, and multifocal pneumonia, which is likely the source of her persistent fevers. She also has hypotension, somnolence, and lower extremity weakness, which may be related to her underlying condition or a new central process.

The patient has undergone various treatments, including broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and supportive care. She has also been started on linezolid, meropenem, and ambisome for her suspected multifocal pneumonia. Her current condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and further evaluation to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers, hypotension, and tachypnea suggest a high risk of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
2. Multifocal Pneumonia: The patient's bilateral patchy infiltrates and negative BAL and thoracentesis results suggest a high risk of multifocal pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure and death.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's CXR shows cleared pleural effusion, but the possibility of pulmonary edema remains, which could lead to respiratory failure and death.
4. ARDS or Acute Lung Injury: The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 265 suggests a high risk of ARDS or acute lung injury, which could lead to respiratory failure and death.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or medication side effects, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
6. Somnolence: The patient's somnolence may be related to her underlying condition, hypotension, or hypoxia, which could lead to further deterioration and death.
7. Lower Extremity Weakness: The patient's lower extremity weakness may be related to her underlying condition, leukostasis, or a new central process, which could lead to further deterioration and death.
8. Infection: The patient's persistent fevers and negative cultures suggest a high risk of infection, which could lead to further deterioration and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for multifocal pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's oxygenation and respiratory status closely.
3. Consider diuresis for pulmonary edema.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and perfusion status closely.
5. Consider adding bactrim or aminoglycoside if the patient decompensates further.
6. Trend the patient's WBC and fever curve.
7. Consider adding neuro consult for the patient's lower extremity weakness.
8. Continue supportive care, including fluid resuscitation and transfusions as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yof h/o MDS presenting with new AML requiring chemotherapy, with
   persistent neutropenia, now with worsening respiratory distress,
   hypoxemia and hypotension.
   HYPOXEMIA -- Bilateral patchy infiltrates in neutropenic patent.
   Unclear etiology.  Monitor SaO2, RR, maintain saO2 >90%. Continue
   empirical broad spectrum antibiotic coverage for likely multifocal
   pneumonia.
   HYPOTENSION
 attributed to sepsis and component of hypovolemia.
   Currently fluid responsive. Provide fluids to maintain MAP > 60 mmHg.
   Consider levophed if fluids unresponsive.  Check ECG, cardiac enzymes.
   Consider relative adrenal insufficiency.
   FEVERs -- Peristent fevers most likely reflect infectious etiology.
   Continue linezolid/ meropenem/ ambisome/ flagyl.  F/U infectious
   evaluation with blood/ urine/ sputum cultures.  Trend WBC and fever
   curve.  Check ID recommendations.  Consider adding bactrim or
   aminoglycoside if clinically decompensates.
   LOWER EXTREMITY WEAKNESS
 concern for possible CNS pathology or spinal
   cord lesion.  Would proceed with spine imaging as per Neurology
   consultation.
   AML -- s/p induction.  Neupogen discontinued.  Monitor CBC w/
   differential.  Supportive transfusions for Hct < 25, plt < 10.  Need to
   determine if pt is candidate for transplant .
   TACHYCARDIA -- Repeat episodes of SVT likely AVNRT driven by high
   metabolic demands.   Monitor HR.
   Elevated ALK PHOS
 check RUQ U/S.  Monitor abd exam.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presented with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) requiring chemotherapy. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to worsening respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100.1°F)
* Heart rate: 100 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 74/58 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute (ins/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 92%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Well-nourished, no acute distress
* Eyes: Pupils normal, no conjunctival edema
* Cardiovascular: Normal pulse, no murmurs
* Respiratory: Clear breath sounds, no wheezes
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right and left lower extremity edema: trace
* Skin: Warm, no rash
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 0.1 K/uL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 24.2%
* Platelet count (Plt): 23 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.03 ng/mL
* Glucose: 118 mg/dL

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring. Potential medical complications include:

* Hypoxemia: Bilateral patchy infiltrates in neutropenic patient, unclear etiology
* Hypotension: Attributed to sepsis and component of hypovolemia
* Fever: Persistent fevers most likely reflect infectious etiology
* Lower extremity weakness: Concern for possible CNS pathology or spinal cord lesion
* Tachycardia: Repeat episodes of SVT likely AVNRT driven by high metabolic demands
* Elevated ALK PHOS: Check RUQ U/S, monitor abdominal exam

The patient's plan includes:

* Monitoring SaO2, RR, and maintaining SaO2 >90%
* Providing fluids to maintain MAP > 60 mmHg
* Consider levophed if fluids unresponsive
* Continuing empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for likely multifocal pneumonia
* Trending WBC and fever curve
* Checking ID recommendations and considering adding bactrim or aminoglycoside if clinically decompensates
* Proceeding with spine imaging as per Neurology consultation
* Monitoring CBC with differential and supportive transfusions for Hct < 25 and plt < 10
* Determining if the patient is a candidate for transplant"
