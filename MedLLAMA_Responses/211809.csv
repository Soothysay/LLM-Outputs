   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 60 y.o male with no PMH admitted for GIB, now s/p pre-syncopal
   episode.
   #GIB-Likely UGIB, could be fast, given melena with frank blood. In
   addition, BUN slightly elevated. Pt with recent heavy NSAID use and
   daily ETOH. Pt with 10pt HCT drop over 4 hrs. Since that time, he was
   given 2L IVF and is now currently getting his 3rd unit of PRBCs. Pt
   sinus tachy,  but normotensive. Also could be LGIB from
   diverticula/colitis etc.

   -IV PPI gtt.
   -HCT goal >30.
   -will consider massive transfusion protocol if indicated.
   #pre-syncope-Pt with h.o diaphoresis, LH, bradycardia/hypotension in
   the past. Had 2 episodes today, including 1 while going to the bathroom
   on [**Hospital Ward Name **] 2. No LOC. Likely presyncopal due to hypovolemia from GIB. Also
   could be vasovagal in nature given the above. Will consider other
   causes such as cardiac, neurologic, etc if symptoms still persist
   despite, w/u and tx for the above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with no prior medical history who was admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He had a pre-syncopal episode and was found to have a floridly positive RBC scan for bleeding near the splenic flexure. He underwent endoscopy and angiography, but no source of bleeding was identified. The patient has received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 2 liters of intravenous fluid (IVF). He is currently receiving IV PPI and has a goal hemoglobin (HCT) of >30.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, and blood pressure of 130/82 mmHg. He has a sinus rhythm and is receiving oxygen therapy. His respiratory support includes a Venti mask with an SpO2 of 98%.

The patient's physical examination is normal, with no acute distress, clear lungs, and a soft, non-tender abdomen. His laboratory results show a slight elevation in BUN, but his other labs are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's GIB and recent blood transfusions may lead to hypovolemic shock if not managed properly.
2. Vasovagal syncope: The patient's pre-syncopal episodes may be due to vasovagal syncope, which could be triggered by hypovolemia, pain, or other factors.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus tachycardia and recent blood transfusions may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's GIB and recent blood transfusions may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Infection: The patient's recent blood transfusions and GIB may increase the risk of infection, particularly sepsis.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's GIB may continue to bleed, leading to further complications, such as hypovolemic shock or cardiac arrest.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's recent blood transfusions may lead to coagulopathy, which could increase the risk of bleeding or other complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications and ensure his safe and effective treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 60 y.o male with no PMH admitted for GIB, now s/p pre-syncopal
   episode.
   # GIB-Most likely ileal or jejeunal source, as EGD was negative and
   colon was full of blood on colonoscopy.  He was given 7 [**Location 9349**]
   overnight and continues to have dark stools.  Pt with recent heavy
   NSAID use and daily ETOH.
   - F/U GI recs.
   - Touch base with surgery re: possible CT scan to evalute for possible
   GI mass
   - Consider repeat colonoscopy with better GI prep.
   - IV access with 4 PIVS, 2 16's and 2 18
s gauge
   - Active T+S and crossmatch for 6units
   - IV PPI gtt.
   - F/U repeat Hct with goal >30.
   - F/U ionized calcium and replete lytes as needed
   - will consider massive transfusion protocol if indicated.
   # Tachycardia:  The patient continues to have sinus tachycardia with
   current rates in the 130s.   DDx includes hypovolemia v. pain.  BUN
   increased, which may be secondary to hypovolemia v. UGIB.
    - Bolus 1000 cc NS with maintenance IVFs thereafter
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   # Pre-syncope:  The patient has a history of vagal episodes with
   diaphoresis, lightheadedness, bradycardia/hypotension in the past.  He
   had two such episodes yesterday, including one while going to the
   bathroom on [**Hospital Ward Name 289**] 2. No LOC. Likely presyncopal due to hypovolemia from
   GIB. Also could be vasovagal in nature given the above. Will consider
   other causes such as cardiac, neurologic, etc if symptoms still persist
   despite, w/u and tx for the above.
   - Continue to monitor on tele
    - Atropine at bedside in case patient loses consciousness.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) with a recent pre-syncopal episode. The patient's condition is complex, and potential medical complications are:

1. Hypovolemic shock: The patient has ongoing bleeding, and his hemodynamic monitoring shows decreased blood pressure and increased heart rate, indicating possible hypovolemic shock.
2. Vasovagal episode: The patient has a history of vagal episodes, and the pre-syncopal episode could be due to vasovagal response to hypovolemia or other factors.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has ongoing bleeding, and the source is suspected to be from the small intestine. Further imaging and endoscopy may be necessary to identify the exact location and cause of the bleeding.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased significantly, indicating anemia. Further monitoring and transfusions may be necessary to manage this condition.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show decreased calcium, magnesium, and potassium levels, indicating electrolyte imbalance. Close monitoring and repletion as necessary may be required.
6. Tachycardia: The patient has ongoing tachycardia, which may be secondary to hypovolemia, pain, or other factors. Further evaluation and management may be necessary to address this condition.
7. Infection: The patient has received antibiotics and has ongoing bleeding, which increases the risk of infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and prompt treatment if necessary may be required.
8. Respiratory compromise: The patient has ongoing bleeding and may be at risk for respiratory compromise due to decreased blood volume and potential hypovolemic shock.
9. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may indicate cardiac complications, such as cardiac tamponade or cardiogenic shock. Further evaluation and management may be necessary to address these conditions.

Based on the patient's complex condition, close monitoring and management are necessary to address these potential complications and prevent further deterioration."

Summary:

The patient, a 60-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and vasovagal episodes. He has a history of GIB and vasovagal episodes. The patient has received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in the past 24 hours and has undergone an upper endoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy, which showed bleeding in the colon extending to the terminal ileum. A red blood cell (RBC) scan suggested bleeding near the terminal ileum, but a diagnostic angiogram did not reveal any extravasation of contrast. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's GIB is ongoing, and further bleeding could lead to hypovolemic shock, organ failure, and death.
2. Vasovagal episodes: The patient's history of vasovagal episodes increases the risk of further episodes, which could lead to bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiac arrest.
3. Infection: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines increase the risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis, organ failure, and death.
4. Thrombosis: The patient's prolonged immobility and invasive lines increase the risk of thrombosis, which could lead to pulmonary embolism, stroke, or myocardial infarction.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of malnutrition, which could lead to weakness, fatigue, and decreased immune function.
6. Medication errors: The patient's complex medication regimen and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of medication errors, which could lead to adverse reactions, organ failure, and death.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of vasovagal episodes and ongoing GIB increase the risk of cardiovascular instability, which could lead to cardiac arrest, stroke, or myocardial infarction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and bleeding status closely.
2. Discuss next diagnostic steps with GI, surgery, and IR to determine the source of the bleeding.
3. Continue resuscitation efforts, including transfusions and medications as needed.
4. Monitor ionized calcium and coagulation studies closely.
5. Consider changing the patient's PPI to [**Hospital1**].
6. Monitor the patient's nutritional status and provide enteral or parenteral nutrition as needed.
7. Implement stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prevention measures.
8. Consider consultation with a cardiothoracic surgeon to evaluate the patient's cardiovascular status and potential need for cardiac intervention."

As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male who presented with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and vasovagal episodes. The patient has undergone a 7-unit blood transfusion, and despite this, continues to have active bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 141/90 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 94%.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. The cardiovascular examination is normal, and the peripheral vascular examination shows bilateral radial pulses present. The respiratory examination shows symmetric expansion and clear breath sounds.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 80 mg/dL, platelet count of 0.6 mg/dL, and white blood cell count of 18 mEq/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are normal, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.5 mEq/L. The patient's coagulation studies show a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.2.

The patient's imaging studies show a negative diagnostic angiogram, which failed to identify a localizable focus of bleeding. The patient's microbiology results are negative.

The patient's assessment and plan include continued resuscitation, monitoring of ionized calcium and coagulation studies, and discussion of next diagnostic steps with the gastroenterology, surgery, and interventional radiology teams. The patient's vasovagal episodes are being managed with atropine and Trendelenburg positioning as needed.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's bleeding is ongoing, and further transfusions may be necessary to maintain hemostasis.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged PT and PTT suggest a coagulopathy, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's slightly elevated potassium level may require close monitoring and correction.
4. Infection: The patient's negative microbiology results do not rule out the possibility of infection, particularly in the setting of ongoing bleeding.
5. Vasovagal episodes: The patient's vasovagal episodes may recur, requiring close monitoring and management.
6. Respiratory compromise: The patient's ongoing bleeding may lead to respiratory compromise, particularly if the bleeding is severe or prolonged.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's ongoing bleeding may lead to cardiovascular instability, particularly if the bleeding is severe or prolonged.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and manage potential complications."

Summary:

The patient, a 60-year-old male with no prior medical history, was admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and had a pre-syncopal episode. A CT abdomen was performed, which revealed a small mass in the small intestine. The patient's ionized calcium level was low, and he received calcium gluconate. He received two units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) to increase his hemoglobin (Hct) from 26.5 to 29.5. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, and blood pressure of 137/91 mmHg. He is receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's GIB may continue to bleed, leading to further complications, such as hypovolemic shock or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
2. Jejunal mass: The small intestine mass may cause bowel obstruction, perforation, or bleeding, which could lead to serious complications.
3. Pre-syncopal episode: The patient's history of vagal episodes with diaphoresis, lightheadedness, bradycardia, and hypotension may recur, putting him at risk for cardiac arrest or loss of consciousness.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be a sign of hypovolemia or pain, which could lead to cardiac complications if left untreated.
5. Hypocalcemia: The patient's low ionized calcium level may cause muscle cramps, cardiac arrhythmias, or seizures if not treated promptly.
6. Respiratory compromise: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to hypovolemic shock, bowel obstruction, or other complications.
7. Infection: The patient's compromised immune status and invasive procedures may increase his risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia, sepsis, or urinary tract infections.
8. Bleeding complications: The patient's use of anticoagulants and invasive procedures may increase his risk of bleeding complications, such as hemorrhagic shock or disseminated intravascular coagulation."

   # Pre-syncope:  The patient has a history of vagal episodes with
   diaphoresis, lightheadedness, bradycardia/hypotension in the past.  He
   had two such episodes yesterday, including one while going to the
   bathroom on [**Hospital Ward Name 289**] 2. No LOC. Likely presyncopal due to hypovolemia from
   GIB. Also could be vasovagal in nature given the above. Will consider
   other causes such as cardiac, neurologic, etc if symptoms still persist
   despite, w/u and tx for the above.
   - Continue to monitor on tele
   - Atropine at bedside in case patient loses consciousness.
   - IVF/PRBCs
   # Tachycardia:  The patient had sinus tachycardia with rates in the
   130s but has slowed today.   DDx includes hypovolemia v. pain.  BUN
   increased, which may be secondary to hypovolemia v. UGIB.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   60 y.o male with no PMH admitted for GIB, now s/p pre-syncopal episode.
   # GIB/Jejunal mass:  Most likely ileal or jejeunal source, as EGD was
   negative and colon was full of blood on colonoscopy.  He was given 7 [**Location 9380**] overnight on [**7-26**] and 4 [**Location 9349**] on [**8-17**] (27 -> 31).
   Continues to have dark stools.  Pt with recent heavy NSAID use and
   daily ETOH.  Surgery plans to take to OR today for resection of likely
   GIST in jejunum.
   - To OR today for resection of mass
   - IR may mark mass pre-op; have discussed with surgical resident
   - IV access with 4 PIVS, 2 16's and 2 18
s gauge
   - Active T+S and crossmatch
   - PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - Hct q4hr, ionized calcium (ordered)
   - F/U repeat Hct
   - will consider massive transfusion protocol if indicated.
   # Pre-syncope:  The patient has a history of vagal episodes with
   diaphoresis, lightheadedness, bradycardia/hypotension in the past.  He
   had two such episodes yesterday, including one while going to the
   bathroom on [**Hospital Ward Name 289**] 2. No LOC. Likely presyncopal due to hypovolemia from
   GIB. Also could be vasovagal in nature given the above. Will consider
   other causes such as cardiac, neurologic, etc if symptoms still persist
   despite, w/u and tx for the above.
   - Continue to monitor on tele
   - Atropine at bedside in case patient loses consciousness.
   - IVF/PRBCs
   # Tachycardia:  The patient had sinus tachycardia with rates in the
   130s but has slowed today.   DDx includes hypovolemia v. pain.  BUN
   increased, which may be secondary to hypovolemia v. UGIB.
    - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   FEN: NPO for now.
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, PPI [**Hospital1 **], no need for bowel reg.
   Access: peripherals 3 PIVs, 2 16's and 18.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with no prior medical history who was admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is now experiencing a pre-syncopal episode. He has a small mass in his small intestine that may be a GIST, and surgery is planned for today. The patient has a history of vagal episodes with diaphoresis, lightheadedness, bradycardia/hypotension, and has experienced two such episodes yesterday. He is being monitored closely for signs of hypovolemia, vasovagal reactions, and cardiac/neurologic causes of his symptoms.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 137/91 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 29.5 g/dL, platelet count of 121 K/uL, and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 24 mg/dL.

The patient is receiving IV fluids, packed red blood cells, and ionized calcium supplementation. He is also being treated with pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis and has been given atropine at bedside in case of loss of consciousness.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Hypovolemic shock due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and inadequate fluid resuscitation.
2. Vasovagal reactions or syncope due to hypovolemia, pain, or other factors.
3. Cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure due to hypovolemia or underlying cardiac disease.
4. Neurologic complications such as seizures or loss of consciousness due to hypovolemia, vasovagal reactions, or other factors.
5. Infection or sepsis due to gastrointestinal bleeding or other sources.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the small mass in the small intestine.
7. Respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome due to aspiration or other factors.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, close monitoring and management in the ICU are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with no prior medical history (pmh) who presents with a brisk gastrointestinal bleed (GIB) likely caused by a small bowel mass, radiographically consistent with [**Year (4 digits) **]. The patient has undergone a 24-hour period of fluid resuscitation with 5 units of blood, and his calcium levels have increased by 4 grams. He is awaiting surgery today.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 98 beats per minute, blood pressure of 128/78 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 98% on room air, and he is not in respiratory distress.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress, normocephalic head, and clear breath sounds. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. His extremities are warm, and his skin is warm.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL, white blood cell count of 9.0 K/uL, and platelet count of 139 K/uL. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 24 mEq/L, and his creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Surgery for the small bowel mass today.
2. Daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.
3. Frequent checks of hemoglobin, calcium, and repletion as needed.
4. ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Hemorrhagic shock due to ongoing bleeding.
2. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, related to the patient's cardiac history.
3. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, related to the patient's respiratory status.
4. Neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, related to the patient's neurological status.
5. Infection, such as sepsis or organ failure, related to the patient's compromised immune system.
6. Gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation or obstruction, related to the patient's gastrointestinal bleed.
7. Fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance related to fluid resuscitation and medication administration.
8. Sepsis or organ failure related to the patient's compromised immune system."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with no prior medical history who presents with brisk gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) likely caused by a small bowel mass radiographically consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). The patient has received a total of 5 units of blood in the past 24 hours and is awaiting surgery today. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 98 beats per minute, blood pressure of 128/78 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. The cardiovascular examination is normal, and the patient has a soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. The patient's neurologic examination is abnormal, with the patient being non-attentive, not following simple commands, and not responding to stimuli.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.2 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 9.0 K/uL
* Platelet count: 139 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 80 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Awaiting surgery for the small bowel mass
* Continuation of frequent checks of hemoglobin, calcium, and repletion as needed
* Prophylactic treatment for stress ulcers with proton pump inhibitors (PPI)
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with boots
* Prophylaxis for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications related to surgery, although the patient is at a low risk
* Hemorrhagic complications related to the surgical procedure
* Infection complications related to the surgical site
* Respiratory complications related to the patient's underlying condition
* Neurologic complications related to the patient's underlying condition
* Gastrointestinal complications related to the patient's underlying condition"
