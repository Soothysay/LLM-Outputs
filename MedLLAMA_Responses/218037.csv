You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation, COPD, small cell lung cancer, diverticulitis with perforation and colostomy, and diastolic dysfunction. She was admitted for elective takedown of colostomy and ventral hernia repair, but developed hypotension and poor urine output during the procedure. She received 3 liters of lactated Ringer's solution and was successfully weaned off Neo. She was also bolused with additional 4 liters of LR to maintain blood pressure. Despite this, her urine output remained poor.

Current Status:

The patient is currently in the ICU, receiving mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is on amiodarone and coumadin. She has also been diagnosed with diastolic heart failure and is at risk for cardiac complications. Her respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 100%. Her hemodynamic status is unstable, with a BP of 105/44 mmHg and a HR of 60 bpm.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure, she is at risk for cardiac complications such as atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's COPD and diastolic heart failure increase her risk for respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and respiratory arrest.
3. Renal Complications: The patient's oliguria and low urine output increase her risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
4. Infection: The patient's colostomy and recent surgery increase her risk for infection, including surgical site infection, urinary tract infection, and pneumonia.
5. Hemorrhage: The patient's low hemoglobin level and recent surgery increase her risk for hemorrhage, including bleeding from the surgical site, gastrointestinal tract, or respiratory tract.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient's history of volume overload and recent surgery increase her risk for fluid overload, including congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and respiratory distress.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and adjust vasopressor support as needed.
2. Consider increasing the patient's urine output with lasix challenge and fluid bolus if necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust mechanical ventilation settings as needed.
4. Consider performing a renal ultrasound to exclude obstructive uropathy.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust anticoagulation therapy as needed.
6. Consider performing a stress test to assess the patient's cardiac function."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year-old female with a history of a.fib on coumadin, perforated
   diverticulum s/p sigmoid Hartmann in [**4-21**], diastolic heart failure who
   presented for colostomy takedown and ventral hernia repair complicated
   by hypotension and low UOP postoperatively.
   # Hypotension: The patient was noted to have SBPs of 70's in the OR and
   postoperatively and was supported with neo for a short while.   This
   was weaned off prior to her admission, however her SBPs ran in the high
   80
s to low 100
s overnight, most recently in the low 100s. Her
   outpatient records show that her normal SBP ranges in the 90's to
   100's.  Given concern for a Hct drop postoperatively ( from 37.3 to 26
   and INR of 1.8), she was given 1 unit of FFP, 1 unit of PRBC, and Vit K
   overnight.  Her Hct had an appropriate rise to the blood and has
   remained stable around 30.  She received a total of > 9 L of fluid
   yesterday and continues to sat well on 2 L NC.  She has remained
   afebrile; her UA did show 14 WBC, few back, and [**Last Name (un) **] leuk.  Another
   cause for her lowish BP could have been the dilaudid PCA which was
   being given for pain control.
   - Will check [**Hospital1 **] Hct and monitor JP output.
   - F/u UCx, BCx.
   # S/p colostomy takedown and ventral hernia repair:
   - F/u surgery recs.
   - NPO for now.
   - Ostomy and surgical wound care.
   - Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
   - Cefazolin and flagyl per surgery for postop antibiotic ppx.
   # Oligura: The patient had only made 192 cc of urine in 10 hours intra
   and postoperatively.  She was given 3 L LR during the case and another
   4 L in the PACU.  Cr was 1.4 postoperatively which is within her most
   recent baseline.  Her oliguria may represent ATN given her hypotension
   in the OR.  This am her Cr is stable at 1.5, however her UOP remains
   low with only 34 cc in 6 hours.  She was given a trial of 40 mg IV
   lasix last night without response.  Her FENA is 0.1, however she was on
   lasix as an outpatient making this unreliable.  Her FEUrea is 16.89 %
   which is also consistent with prerenal ARF.
   - Will obtain a renal US this am to rule out postrenal causes such as
   obstruction from her recent surgery as well as obtain dopplers to check
   blood flow to the kidney.
   - Most likely her oligura represents ATN secondary to hypotension in
   the OR.  She has been unresponsive to IVF making prerenal ARF unlikely
   even though her urine electorlytes support a prerenal etiology.
   - Will try another 40 mg IV lasix.
   - Monitor urine output closely.
   # Atrial fibrillation s/p pacemaker placement for tachy-brady
   syndrome:  Patient is currently atrially paced.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q6h while NPO, restart po metoprolol once taking
   POs.
   - Restart amiodarone and coumadin once able to take POs.
   - Holding on the lovenox bridge for now given concern for bleeding; d/w
   surgery when to restart
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Patient with an EF of >55%, but with
   diastolic heart failure.  No sign of volume overload, as above is
   likely volume deplete.
   - Patient was given a trial of 40 mg of IV lasix as above.
   # Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine 25 mcg IV daily while NPO.  Restart her
   home synthroid dose when taking POs.
   # COPD/OSA: Patient has a history of COPD, but is not on medications as
   an outpatient.  Also has a history of OSA, but refuses to wear CPAP.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, perforated diverticulum, and diastolic heart failure who presented for colostomy takedown and ventral hernia repair. The patient has been experiencing hypotension and low urine output postoperatively.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 61 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 109/39 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and is being monitored closely for any changes in her condition.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 30.7%, and platelet count of 169 K/uL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.7 mEq/L and a sodium level of 140 mEq/L.

The patient's medical complications include hypotension, low urine output, and oliguria. The patient's oliguria may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to hypotension in the operating room. The patient has been unresponsive to intravenous fluids and has not shown any improvement in her urine output.

The patient's code status is full code, and she is receiving prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise in the patient's condition include:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria and elevated creatinine level may indicate AKI, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and increased risk of cardiovascular events.
2. Septic shock: The patient's low urine output and elevated white blood cell count may indicate septic shock, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and increased mortality.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of COPD and OSA may increase her risk of respiratory failure, particularly if she experiences further hypotension or oliguria.
4. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and diastolic heart failure may increase her risk of cardiac arrest, particularly if she experiences further hypotension or oliguria.
5. Infection: The patient's surgical site and urinary catheter may be at risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Administer intravenous fluids and vasopressors as needed to maintain blood pressure and urine output.
3. Consider initiating dialysis if the patient's kidney function does not improve.
4. Continue prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.
5. Consider referring the patient to a nephrologist for further management of her kidney function.

I hope this summary and recommendations are helpful."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year-old female with a history of a.fib on coumadin, perforated
   diverticulum s/p sigmoid Hartmann in [**4-21**], diastolic heart failure who
   presented for colostomy takedown and ventral hernia repair complicated
   by hypotension and low UOP postoperatively.
   # Hypotension: The patient was noted to have SBPs of 70's in the OR and
   postoperatively and was supported with neo for a short while.   This
   was weaned off prior to her admission, however her SBPs ran in the high
   80
s to low 100
s overnight, most recently in the low 100s. Her
   outpatient records show that her normal SBP ranges in the 90's to
   100's.  Given concern for a Hct drop postoperatively ( from 37.3 to 26
   and INR of 1.8), she was given 1 unit of FFP, 1 unit of PRBC, and Vit K
   overnight.  Her Hct had an appropriate rise to the blood and has
   remained stable around 30.  She received a total of > 9 L of fluid
   yesterday and continues to sat well on 2 L NC.  She has remained
   afebrile; her UA did show 14 WBC, few back, and [**Last Name (un) **] leuk.  Another
   cause for her lowish BP could have been the dilaudid PCA which was

   - Cefazolin and flagyl per surgery for postop antibiotic ppx.
   # Oligura: The patient had only made 192 cc of urine in 10 hours intra
   and postoperatively.  She was given 3 L LR during the case and another
   4 L in the PACU.  Cr was 1.4 postoperatively which is within her most
   recent baseline.  Her oliguria may represent ATN given her hypotension
   in the OR.  This am her Cr is stable at 1.5, however her UOP remains
   low with only 34 cc in 6 hours.  She was given a trial of 40 mg IV
   lasix last night without response.  Her FENA is 0.1, however she was on
   lasix as an outpatient making this unreliable.  Her FEUrea is 16.89 %
   which is also consistent with prerenal ARF.
   - Will obtain a renal US this am to rule out postrenal causes such as
   obstruction from her recent surgery as well as obtain dopplers to check
   blood flow to the kidney.
   - Most likely her oligura represents ATN secondary to hypotension in

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's oliguria, low urine output, and elevated creatinine levels may indicate ATN, which can be caused by hypotension, sepsis, or nephrotoxic medications.
2. Prerenal Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine levels may also indicate prerenal ARF, which can be caused by hypovolemia, heart failure, or nephrotoxic medications.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and Coumadin therapy may increase her risk of bleeding complications, particularly if her INR is not properly managed.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of COPD and OSA may increase her risk of respiratory complications, particularly if she develops pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and chronic diastolic heart failure may increase her risk of cardiac complications, particularly if she develops cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Close monitoring of her blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output.
2. Administration of IV fluids and vasopressors as needed to maintain blood pressure and urine output.
3. Monitoring of her electrolyte levels and administration of electrolyte supplements as needed.
4. Administration of antibiotics as needed to prevent and treat infections.
5. Monitoring of her renal function and administration of diuretics as needed to manage fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Monitoring of her respiratory function and administration of oxygen therapy as needed to manage respiratory complications.
7. Monitoring of her cardiac function and administration of medications as needed to manage cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 year-old female with a history of a.fib on coumadin, perforated
   diverticulum s/p sigmoid Hartmann in [**4-21**], diastolic heart failure who
   presented for colostomy takedown and ventral hernia repair complicated
   by hypotension and low UOP postoperatively.
   # Hypotension: The patient was noted to have SBPs of 70's in the OR and
   postoperatively and was supported with neo for a short while.   This
   was weaned off prior to her admission, however her SBPs ran in the high
   80
s to low 100
s overnight, most recently in the low 100s. Her
   outpatient records show that her normal SBP ranges in the 90's to
   100's.  Given concern for a Hct drop postoperatively ( from 37.3 to 26
   and INR of 1.8), she was given 1 unit of FFP, 1 unit of PRBC, and Vit K
   overnight.  Her Hct had an appropriate rise to the blood and has
   remained stable around 30.  She received a total of > 9 L of fluid
   yesterday and continues to sat well on 2 L NC.  She has remained
   afebrile; her UA did show 14 WBC, few back, and [**Last Name (un) **] leuk.  Another
   cause for her lowish BP could have been the dilaudid PCA which was
   being given for pain control.
   - Will check [**Hospital1 **] Hct and monitor JP output.
   - F/u UCx, BCx.
   # S/p colostomy takedown and ventral hernia repair:
   - F/u surgery recs.
   - NPO for now.
   - Ostomy and surgical wound care.
   - Dilaudid PCA for pain control.
   - Cefazolin and flagyl per surgery for postop antibiotic ppx.
   # Oligura: The patient had only made 192 cc of urine in 10 hours intra
   and postoperatively.  She was given 3 L LR during the case and another
   4 L in the PACU.  Cr was 1.4 postoperatively which is within her most
   recent baseline.  Her oliguria may represent ATN given her hypotension
   in the OR.  This am her Cr is stable at 1.5, however her UOP remains
   low with only 34 cc in 6 hours.  She was given a trial of 40 mg IV
   lasix last night without response.  Her FENA is 0.1, however she was on
   lasix as an outpatient making this unreliable.  Her FEUrea is 16.89 %
   - Will obtain a renal US this am to rule out postrenal causes such as
   obstruction from her recent surgery as well as obtain dopplers to check
   blood flow to the kidney.
   - Most likely her oligura represents ATN secondary to hypotension in
   the OR.  She has been unresponsive to IVF making prerenal ARF unlikely.
   # Atrial fibrillation s/p pacemaker placement for tachy-brady
   syndrome:  Patient is currently atrially paced.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q6h while NPO, restart po metoprolol once taking
   POs.
   - Restart amiodarone and coumadin once able to take POs.
   - lovenox bridge starting in AM; d/w surgery if needs to be held based
   on HCT
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Patient with an EF of >55%, but with
   diastolic heart failure.  No sign of volume overload, as above is
   likely volume deplete.
   - Patient was given a trial of 40 mg of IV lasix as above.
   # Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine 25 mcg IV daily while NPO.  Restart her
   home synthroid dose when taking POs.
   # COPD/OSA: Patient has a history of COPD, but is not on medications as
   an outpatient.  Also has a history of OSA, but refuses to wear CPAP.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVF as above; replete electrolytes prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   4 L in the PACU.  Cr was 1.4 postoperatively which is within her most
   recent baseline.  Her oliguria may represent ATN given her hypotension
   in the OR.  This am her Cr is stable at 1.5, however her UOP remains
   low with only 34 cc in 6 hours.  She was given a trial of 40 mg IV
   lasix last night without response.  Her FENA is 0.1, however she was on
   lasix as an outpatient making this unreliable.  Her FEUrea is 16.89 %
   - Will obtain a renal US this am to rule out postrenal causes such as
   obstruction from her recent surgery as well as obtain dopplers to check
   blood flow to the kidney.
   - Most likely her oligura represents ATN secondary to hypotension in
   the OR.  She has been unresponsive to IVF making prerenal ARF unlikely.
   # Atrial fibrillation s/p pacemaker placement for tachy-brady
   syndrome:  Patient is currently atrially paced.
   - Metoprolol 5 mg IV q6h while NPO, restart po metoprolol once taking
   POs.
   - Restart amiodarone and coumadin once able to take POs.
   - lovenox bridge starting in AM; d/w surgery if needs to be held based
   on HCT
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure: Patient with an EF of >55%, but with
   diastolic heart failure.  No sign of volume overload, as above is
   likely volume deplete.
   - Patient was given a trial of 40 mg of IV lasix as above.
   # Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine 25 mcg IV daily while NPO.  Restart her
   home synthroid dose when taking POs.
   # COPD/OSA: Patient has a history of COPD, but is not on medications as
   an outpatient.  Also has a history of OSA, but refuses to wear CPAP.
   # FEN: NPO for now; IVF as above; replete electrolytes prn
   # Code:  Full code
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now per surgery

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, perforated diverticulum, and diastolic heart failure. She underwent colostomy takedown and ventral hernia repair, which was complicated by hypotension and low urine output postoperatively.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.8°C, HR 61 bpm, BP 109/39 mmHg, RR 20 breaths/min, SpO2 98%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: AV paced, total IV fluids 9,067 mL, blood products 417 mL
* Respiratory support: SpO2 98% on 2 L NC, ABG 7.31/56/82
* Physical examination: Well-appearing, well-nourished, elderly female with a large midline incision and two JP drains with bloody fluid present
* Laboratory results: WBC 5.7, Hct 22.0, Plt 169, Cr 1.5, TCO2 30, Glucose 114, other labs pending

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been in the range of 70-100 mmHg, which may be due to hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction, or medication side effects.
* Oliguria: The patient's urine output has been low, with only 34 cc in 6 hours, which may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), postrenal obstruction, or prerenal azotemia.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently atrially paced.
* Chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure, which may be exacerbated by her recent surgery.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is receiving levothyroxine IV daily.
* COPD/OSA: The patient has a history of COPD and OSA, which may be exacerbated by her recent surgery.
* FEN: The patient is NPO for now and is receiving IV fluids as above.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support
* Administration of IV fluids, blood products, and medications as necessary
* Trial of diuresis with IV lasix
* Renal US and dopplers to rule out postrenal causes of oliguria
* Restart of metoprolol, amiodarone, and coumadin once able to take POs
* Lovenox bridge starting in AM; d/w surgery if needs to be held based on HCT
* Restart of levothyroxine and synthroid once able to take POs
* NPO for now; IVF as above; replete electrolytes prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a complex medical condition. The patient has undergone surgery and has received blood transfusions, including FFP and PRBC, due to a repeat Hct of 22. The patient's INR was 1.8, and they received 5 mg of SQ Vit K. Post-transfusion, the patient's Hct rose to 31.4. The patient has a history of digoxin allergy and has received antibiotics, including cefazolin and metronidazole.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, and blood pressure of 109/39 mmHg. The patient is receiving respiratory support, with an SpO2 of 98%. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.31, pCO2 of 56 mmHg, and pO2 of 82 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the absence of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other assessments. The patient's labs show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and abnormal renal function tests, including creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding complications due to the patient's INR of 1.8 and recent blood transfusions.
2. Renal failure, which is already present, and may worsen due to inadequate perfusion or underlying kidney disease.
3. Hypotension, which may be due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or medication side effects.
4. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation.
5. Neurologic complications, such as seizures or stroke, given the patient's abnormal ABG and potential hypoxia.
6. Infection, such as sepsis, given the patient's elevated WBC count and recent surgical procedure.
7. Gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or ileus, given the patient's recent surgery and antibiotic use.
8. Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure, given the patient's cardiac rhythm and recent blood transfusions.

These potential complications will require close monitoring and prompt management to prevent further deterioration of the patient's condition."
