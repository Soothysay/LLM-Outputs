   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 43 year old female with ER+/Her2+ breast cancer metastastic
   to brain, lung, liver, and bone previously treated with trastuzumab,
   carboplatin/paclitaxel, radiation to cspine, lspine and hips,
   capecitabine, cyberknife of brain, and most recently treated in [**7-20**]
   with gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab, admitted to OMED on
   [**2187-7-16**] with abdominal pain, jaundice and elevated T Bili s/p ERCP and
   stent placement metastatic disease transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with
   hypothermia and hypotension sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension
 BP stable on pressors through the single lumen
   portho-cath. Patient has not required more fluid boluses. For now,
   -  Central venous line if patient becomes unstable; discussed with
   husband and patient yesterday and both agreed.
   - IV fluids to UOP>30cc/hr,
   - Continue levophed for now
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, obtain sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - ERCP team aware of patient's decompensation, stent well-placed, no
   further intervention appropriate as this is [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - continue stress dose steroids given patient's recent decadron
   treatment 1 week ago
   #Code status: patient is DNR/DNI now. Goals of care must be address
   soon. This will put the line in how aggressive we can get with central
   lines, fluids and other studies. Patient with poor prognosis what would
   be good hospice candidate. Will need to discuss with patient, family,
   oncology and attendings.
   # Delirium: Difficult to assess and can be multifactorial. Patient with
   poor liver funciton on liver failure that can be encephalopath. Also
   with new antibiotics and steroids that may be contributing to the
   picture. This further increases the mortality risk on this patient.
   .
   # Cholestasis - Patient without worsening abdominal pain on transfer or
   acute rise in LFTs to support new/worsening obstruction. Has been on
   cipro for planned 5 day course post ERCP on [**2187-8-21**].
   - appreciate ERCP input
   - pain control as needed
   - continue broad coverage to vanco/cipro/zosyn for pseudomonas double
   coverage
   - monitor LFTs daily
   .
   # Metastatic Breast Cancer - Currently on gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and
   trastuzumab and found to have new t12 metestatic lesion during last
   hospitilization in [**7-20**]. She also has an L4 vertebral fx and options
   inlcude vertebroplasty versus radiation. Patient with no further chemo
   options.
   - plan per pt's oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5187**]
   .
   # Synthetic Liver FAilure - [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - avoid Subclavian line in setting of INR >1.9
   .
   # Pancytopenia: likely due to chemotherapy
   - transfuse for Hct <21 given current decompensation, plt <10K/uL or
   spontaneous bleeding

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer, admitted to the ICU with hypotension, hypothermia, and a lactate level of 4.2. She has a history of chemotherapy and has undergone several treatments, including radiation to the spine and hips. The patient is currently receiving levophed for hypotension and has a central venous line in place. She is also receiving antibiotics for sepsis. The patient's condition is complicated by liver failure, cholestasis, and pancytopenia, likely due to chemotherapy. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the goal is to provide palliative care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's lactate level is elevated, and she is receiving antibiotics for sepsis. However, the patient's condition is complicated by liver failure, which may affect her ability to clear bacteria from her bloodstream.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is impaired, which may lead to further complications, such as encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and jaundice.
3. Cholestasis: The patient's bilirubin level is elevated, which may lead to further complications, such as pruritus, jaundice, and liver failure.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding. The patient's white blood cell count is also low, which may increase the risk of infection.
5. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which may be related to her underlying medical condition, medications, or sepsis. The patient's delirium is a significant concern, as it may increase her risk of mortality.
6. Synthetic Liver Failure: The patient's liver function is impaired, which may lead to synthetic liver failure, which is a life-threatening condition.
7. Vascular Complications: The patient's central venous line may be at risk for complications, such as catheter-related bloodstream infection or thrombosis.
8. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory status is compromised, which may increase her risk of respiratory failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, including her lactate level, and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
2. Consider adding a diuretic to help manage the patient's fluid overload.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with hypotension, hypothermia, and a lactate level of 4.2. They have a PortaCath inserted for medication administration and have been receiving norepinephrine for blood pressure support. The patient is delirious and has been receiving haloperidol for sedation. They have a low urine output and have received a 500cc fluid bolus. The patient's blood work shows evidence of liver dysfunction, and they have a high INR, which has been treated with vitamin K. The patient's respiratory status is stable, and they are receiving oxygen via nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's lactate level is elevated, which may indicate sepsis. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of the infection.
2. Liver Failure: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, which may indicate liver failure. This could lead to coagulopathy, jaundice, and encephalopathy.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and they are receiving norepinephrine for support. This may indicate cardiac dysfunction or failure.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's urine output is low, which may indicate acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is stable, but they may be at risk for respiratory failure due to their underlying illness and potential for pneumonia.
6. Delirium: The patient's delirium may be a sign of underlying infection, metabolic disturbance, or medication side effects. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the delirium.
7. Bloodstream Infection: The patient's PortaCath may be a source of bloodstream infection. Further investigation is needed to rule out this possibility.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's lactate level and adjust therapy as needed to manage sepsis.
2. Consider further evaluation of the patient's liver function and consider liver transplantation if necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust therapy as needed to manage cardiac dysfunction.
4. Consider further evaluation of the patient's urine output and consider renal replacement therapy if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider non-invasive ventilation if necessary.
6. Consider further evaluation of the patient's delirium and adjust therapy as needed to manage the underlying cause.
7. Consider further investigation of the patient's PortaCath to rule out bloodstream infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 43 year old female with ER+/Her2+ breast cancer metastastic
   to brain, lung, liver, and bone previously treated with trastuzumab,
   carboplatin/paclitaxel, radiation to cspine, lspine and hips,
   capecitabine, cyberknife of brain, and most recently treated in [**7-20**]
   with gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab, admitted to OMED on
   [**2187-7-16**] with abdominal pain, jaundice and elevated T Bili s/p ERCP and
   stent placement metastatic disease transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with
   hypothermia and hypotension sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension - Patient met SIRS criteria with T < 96 and SBP<70 on the
   floor prior to transfer which has now resolved with 3L IVF bolus and
   broadening of antibitoics to include vancomycin and zosyn.  Likely
   source is biliary duct obstruction but also has long-standin effusion
   and line as possible sources. ERCP team following. Patient with right
   porta-cath as only access. Patient currently full code. Given widely
   metastatic breast CA, primary oncologist to readress goals of care with
   patient and family.
   - will likely need Central venous line, plan to discuss goals of care
   with husband first
   - IV fluids to [**Name (NI) 949**]>30cc/hr, start levophed via port
   - repeat portable CXR
   - Transfuse for Hct < 30
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics including vanco/unasyn/cipro
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, obtain sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - ERCP team aware of patient's decompensation, stent well-placed, no
   further intervention appropriate as this is [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - continue stress dose steroids given patient's recent decadron
   treatment 1 week ago
   .
   # Cholestasis - On presentation, concern for possible CBD stone or
   sludge or worsening metastatic disease. She is s/p ERCP with stent
   [**2187-8-16**] with downtrending LFTs but Tbili remains in [**11-24**] range. Patient
   without worsening abdominal pain on transfer or acute rise in LFTs to
   support new/worsening obstruction. Has been on cipro for planned 5 day
   course post ERCP on [**2187-8-21**].
   - appreciate ERCP input
   - pain control as needed
   - broaden coverage to vanco/cipro/zosyn for pseudomonas double coverage
   - monitor LFTs daily
   .
   # Metastatic Breast Cancer - Currently on gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and
   trastuzumab and found to have new t12 metestatic lesion during last
   hospitilization in [**7-20**]. She also has an L4 vertebral fx and options
   inlcude vertebroplasty versus radiation. Patient with no further chemo
   options.
   - plan per pt's oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5187**]
   .
   # Synthetic Liver FAilure - [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - avoid Subclavian line in setting of INR >1.9

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, hypothermia, and a lactate level of 4.2. She has a history of ER+/Her2+ breast cancer, which has metastasized to the brain, lung, liver, and bone. She has been treated with various chemotherapies, including trastuzumab, carboplatin/paclitaxel, radiation, and gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab. She is currently on a broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen, including vancomycin and Zosyn, due to suspected sepsis.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 94/69 mmHg, which is considered hypotensive. She is being treated with levophed via her port-a-cath.
2. Hypothermia: The patient's temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), which is considered hypothermic. She is being treated with fluids and other measures to help regulate her body temperature.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a lactate level of 4.2, which is consistent with sepsis. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and other supportive measures.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has a low white blood cell count, platelet count, and hemoglobin level, which is likely due to chemotherapy.
5. Synthetic liver failure: The patient has a high INR (1.9), which suggests synthetic liver failure. She is being treated with vitamin K and other measures to help regulate her coagulation cascade.
6. Cholestasis: The patient has a high total bilirubin level and a high alkaline phosphatase level, which suggests cholestasis. She is being treated with ursodeoxycholic acid and other measures to help regulate her liver function.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's lactate level is high, which suggests that she may be at risk for sepsis. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and other supportive measures.
2. Organ failure: The patient's synthetic liver failure and pancytopenia may increase her risk of organ failure. She is being monitored closely for any signs of organ dysfunction.
3. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and high INR may increase her risk of bleeding. She is being monitored closely for any signs of bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient's high white blood cell count and high lactate level may increase her risk of infection. She is being monitored closely for any signs of infection.
5. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's metastatic breast cancer may continue to progress, which could lead to further complications and decreased quality of life."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Summary:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who developed hypotension and hypothermia and was transferred to the ICU. She is currently receiving treatment with antibiotics, vasopressors, and other medications. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 105 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg. Her respiratory status is also stable, with an oxygen saturation of 97% and a respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute. Her neurological status is compromised, with encephalopathy and inability to provide a history.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient's lactate levels are increasing, and her urine output is decreasing, which may indicate septic shock. The source of sepsis is likely biliary, and the patient is receiving treatment with Vancomycin and Zosyn.
2. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient has metastatic breast cancer, which is a significant risk factor for complications.
3. Encephalopathy: The patient's neurological status is compromised, and she is unable to provide a history. This may indicate a worsening of her encephalopathy or the development of new neurological complications.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she may be at risk for respiratory failure if her underlying condition worsens or if she develops respiratory complications.
5. Infection: The patient is receiving antibiotics, which may indicate an underlying infection. However, the patient's laboratory results, including her white blood cell count and differential, may indicate a risk for infection.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is concerning, with a total fluid input of 4,609 mL and a total fluid output of 1,784 mL. This may indicate fluid overload or a risk for fluid overload.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, but she may be at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, if her underlying condition worsens.
8. Renal Complications: The patient's kidney function is compromised, with a creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL. This may indicate a risk for acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension and hypothermia. She has been receiving antibiotics, including Vancomycin and Zosyn, and has been on levophed for her hypotension. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 97%. Her laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, indicating septic shock, and her blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's lactate levels are increasing, and her urine output is decreasing, which may indicate septic shock. This could lead to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Biliary source of sepsis: The patient's septic shock may be related to a biliary source, which could lead to further complications such as cholangitis, pancreatitis, or liver failure.
3. Metastatic breast cancer: The patient's metastatic breast cancer may be causing her symptoms and could lead to further complications such as bone metastases, lung metastases, or spinal cord compression.
4. ICU-acquired complications: The patient is at risk for ICU-acquired complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-associated bloodstream infections, and pressure ulcers.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's nutrition status is not well-documented, and she may be at risk for malnutrition, which could lead to further complications such as delayed wound healing, decreased immune function, and increased risk of infection.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose levels are not well-controlled, and she may be at risk for hypoglycemia, which could lead to further complications such as seizures, coma, or even death.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a range of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with ER+/Her2+ breast cancer metastatic to brain, lung, liver, and bone, who was admitted to the ICU with hypothermia, hypotension, and sepsis. The patient's condition has been deteriorating, and yesterday, she was made Comfort Measures Only (CMO) per family wishes, with a focus on comfort and supportive treatment only. The patient is currently on a morphine drip at 4mg/hr, which is being titrated to comfort. She is also receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 121 bpm
* Blood pressure: 86/57 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Hemodynamic monitoring shows a sinus tachycardia rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.5 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* Platelet count: 83 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 117 mg/dL
* Amylase and lipase: 26 and 40 IU/L, respectively
* Lactic acid: 5.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.2 g/dL
* LDH: 1444 IU/L
* Calcium: 6.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.1 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's admission diagnosis of sepsis and her laboratory results, including a white blood cell count of 10.5 x 10^9/L and a lactate level of 5.0 mmol/L, suggest that she may be at risk for ongoing sepsis.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure of 86/57 mmHg is below the normal range, which may indicate hypotension. This could be due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or other underlying conditions.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and her oxygen saturation of 94% suggest that she may be at risk for respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's sinus tachycardia rhythm may be a sign of underlying cardiac disease or may be a response to her septic state.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL and her lactate level of 5.0 mmol/L suggest that she may be at risk for renal failure.
6. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver enzymes, including AST and ALT, are elevated, which may indicate liver damage or failure.
7. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's underlying breast cancer is metastatic to multiple organs, which may be progressing and causing her symptoms.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to identify any potential complications early and address them promptly."

Summary:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with ER+/Her2+ breast cancer metastatic to brain, lung, liver, and bone, admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated T Bili s/p ERCP and stent placement. She was previously treated with various chemotherapy regimens and radiation therapy. The patient's condition has deteriorated, and she has been made Comfort Measures Only (CMO) per family wishes. She is currently receiving morphine drip at 4mg/hr and is comfortable. Her vital signs are:

* Tmax: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.1°C (97°F)
* HR: 121 bpm (96-121 bpm)
* BP: 86/57 mmHg (63-128/77-148 mmHg)
* RR: 16 inspirations per minute (15-41 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 94%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 10.5
* Hct: 27.7
* Plt: 83
* Cr: 0.5
* TCO2: 17
* Glucose: 117 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 18.9/39.4/1.7, ALT/AST: 65/268, Alk Phos/T Bili: 634/13.7, Amylase/Lipase: 26/40, Differential-Neuts: 85.0%, Band: 3.0%, Lymph: 5.0%, Mono: 4.0%, Eos: 0.0%, Lactic Acid: 5.0 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.2 g/dL, LDH: 1444 IU/L, Ca++: 6.8 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 2.1 mg/dL

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is currently receiving antibiotics. However, the antibiotics have been stopped, and the patient is at risk for further sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 94%, and her respiratory rate is 16 inspirations per minute. She may be at risk for respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's heart rate is 121 bpm, which may be indicative of cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 0.5, which may indicate renal failure.
5. Hepatic failure: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, which may indicate hepatic failure.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.2 g/dL, which may indicate anemia.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 83, which may indicate thrombocytopenia.
8. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is 10.5, which may indicate infection.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a complex medical condition. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 121 beats per minute, blood pressure of 86/57 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 94% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 10.5, hemoglobin of 9.2 g/dL, and platelet count of 83. The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 268 IU/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level of 65 IU/L. The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 0.5 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 15 mg/dL.

The patient has a central venous catheter (PortaCath) inserted on [**2187-8-19**] 11:21 AM and is receiving prophylactic heparin sodium to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is also receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis and has a nasogastric (NG) tube in place.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's impaired renal function and elevated BUN level indicate the risk of AKI, which can progress to chronic kidney disease or even require dialysis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and decreased oxygen saturation suggest the possibility of respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxemia and even respiratory arrest.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension suggest the possibility of cardiovascular instability, which can lead to cardiac arrest or even death.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and stress ulcer prophylaxis suggest the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and even death.
6. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is not well-documented, but the possibility of neurological deterioration cannot be ruled out, especially given the patient's elevated lactate level.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status closely to prevent or manage any potential complications that may arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 43 year old female with ER+/Her2+ breast cancer metastastic
   to brain, lung, liver, and bone previously treated with trastuzumab,
   carboplatin/paclitaxel, radiation to cspine, lspine and hips,
   capecitabine, cyberknife of brain, and most recently treated in [**7-20**]
   with gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab, admitted to OMED on
   [**2187-7-16**] with abdominal pain, jaundice and elevated T Bili s/p ERCP and
   stent placement metastatic disease transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with
   hypothermia and hypotension sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension
 BP stable on pressors through the single lumen
   portho-cath. Patient has not required more fluid boluses. For now,
   -  Central venous line if patient becomes unstable; discussed with
   husband and patient yesterday and both agreed.
   - IV fluids to UOP>30cc/hr,
   - Continue levophed for now
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, obtain sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - ERCP team aware of patient's decompensation, stent well-placed, no
   further intervention appropriate as this is [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - continue stress dose steroids given patient's recent decadron
   treatment 1 week ago
   #Code status: patient is DNR/DNI now. Goals of care must be address
   soon. This will put the line in how aggressive we can get with central
   lines, fluids and other studies. Patient with poor prognosis what would
   be good hospice candidate. Will need to discuss with patient, family,
   oncology and attendings.
   # Delirium: Difficult to assess and can be multifactorial. Patient with
   poor liver funciton on liver failure that can be encephalopath. Also
   with new antibiotics and steroids that may be contributing to the
   picture. This further increases the mortality risk on this patient.
   .
   # Cholestasis - Patient without worsening abdominal pain on transfer or
   acute rise in LFTs to support new/worsening obstruction. Has been on
   cipro for planned 5 day course post ERCP on [**2187-8-21**].
   - appreciate ERCP input
   - pain control as needed
   - continue broad coverage to vanco/cipro/zosyn for pseudomonas double
   coverage
   - monitor LFTs daily
   .
   # Metastatic Breast Cancer - Currently on gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and
   trastuzumab and found to have new t12 metestatic lesion during last
   hospitilization in [**7-20**]. She also has an L4 vertebral fx and options
   inlcude vertebroplasty versus radiation. Patient with no further chemo
   options.
   - plan per pt's oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5187**]
   .
   # Synthetic Liver FAilure - [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - avoid Subclavian line in setting of INR >1.9
   .
   # Pancytopenia: likely due to chemotherapy
   - transfuse for Hct <21 given current decompensation, plt <10K/uL or
   spontaneous bleeding
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, electrolyte sliding scale
   .
   # Access: Port
   .
   # PPx:  hold HEP SC [**1-13**] coagulopathy, Bowel REgimen, PPI
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 43 year old female with ER+/Her2+ breast cancer metastastic
   to brain, lung, liver, and bone previously treated with trastuzumab,
   carboplatin/paclitaxel, radiation to cspine, lspine and hips,
   capecitabine, cyberknife of brain, and most recently treated in [**7-20**]
   with gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and trastuzumab, admitted to OMED on
   [**2187-7-16**] with abdominal pain, jaundice and elevated T Bili s/p ERCP and
   stent placement metastatic disease transfered to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] with
   hypothermia and hypotension sepsis.
   .
   Plan:
   # Hypotension
 BP stable on pressors through the single lumen
   portho-cath. Patient has not required more fluid boluses. For now,
   -  Central venous line if patient becomes unstable; discussed with
   husband and patient yesterday and both agreed.
   - IV fluids to UOP>30cc/hr,
   - Continue levophed for now
   - Follow-up blood, urine cultures, obtain sputum cx
   - Trend WBC count, fever curve.
   - ERCP team aware of patient's decompensation, stent well-placed, no
   further intervention appropriate as this is [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - continue stress dose steroids given patient's recent decadron
   treatment 1 week ago
   #Code status: patient is DNR/DNI now. Goals of care must be address
   soon. This will put the line in how aggressive we can get with central
   lines, fluids and other studies. Patient with poor prognosis what would
   be good hospice candidate. Will need to discuss with patient, family,
   oncology and attendings.
   # Delirium: Difficult to assess and can be multifactorial. Patient with
   poor liver funciton on liver failure that can be encephalopath. Also
   with new antibiotics and steroids that may be contributing to the
   picture. This further increases the mortality risk on this patient.
   .
   # Cholestasis - Patient without worsening abdominal pain on transfer or
   acute rise in LFTs to support new/worsening obstruction. Has been on
   cipro for planned 5 day course post ERCP on [**2187-8-21**].
   - appreciate ERCP input
   - pain control as needed
   - continue broad coverage to vanco/cipro/zosyn for pseudomonas double
   coverage
   - monitor LFTs daily
   .
   # Metastatic Breast Cancer - Currently on gemcitabine, bevacizumab, and
   trastuzumab and found to have new t12 metestatic lesion during last
   hospitilization in [**7-20**]. She also has an L4 vertebral fx and options
   inlcude vertebroplasty versus radiation. Patient with no further chemo
   options.
   - plan per pt's oncologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5187**]
   .
   # Synthetic Liver FAilure - [**1-13**] metastatic disease
   - avoid Subclavian line in setting of INR >1.9
   .
   # Pancytopenia: likely due to chemotherapy
   - transfuse for Hct <21 given current decompensation, plt <10K/uL or
   spontaneous bleeding
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now, electrolyte sliding scale

Summary:

The patient is a 43-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer, previously treated with various chemotherapy regimens, radiation, and bevacizumab. She was admitted to the ICU with hypothermia, hypotension, and sepsis. The patient has a poor prognosis and is a potential candidate for hospice care. She is currently on levophed for blood pressure support and IV morphine for pain management. The patient has a central venous line, and the plan is to continue it if she becomes unstable.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and she is on pressors to maintain it. If the pressors are stopped or reduced, the patient may experience hypotension, which could lead to organ failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, which can progress to septic shock if not managed properly. This could lead to multiple organ failure and death.
3. Delirium: The patient has delirium, which can be multifactorial. The patient's liver function is impaired, and new antibiotics and steroids may be contributing to the delirium. This can increase the mortality risk.
4. Cholestasis: The patient has cholestasis, which can lead to worsening liver function and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding and infection.
6. Synthetic Liver Failure: The patient has synthetic liver failure, which can lead to worsening liver function and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient has metastatic breast cancer, which is a poor prognosis. The cancer may continue to progress, and the patient may experience further complications.
8. FEN (Fever, Electrolyte, and Nutritional) syndrome: The patient has FEN syndrome, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances and potentially life-threatening complications.
9. INR >1.9: The patient's INR is elevated, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
10. Potential for further complications: The patient's condition is unstable, and she may experience further complications, such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or renal failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.4°F)
* Heart rate: 120 bpm (96-121 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 80/52 mmHg (59-128/45-87 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 9 breaths per minute (9-33 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 12.1 K/uL
* Platelet count: 81 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 15 mEq/L
* Sodium: 132 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.1 mEq/L
* Chloride: 100 mEq/L
* Total CO2: 29.2%
* Glucose: 117 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 5.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.2 g/dL
* LDH: 1444 IU/L
* Calcium: 6.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
