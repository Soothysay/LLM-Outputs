   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Had abdominal pain on exam got plain film: nonobstructive bowel gas
   pattern. No evidence of free air. Scoliosis. Large
   hiatal hernia.
   - R shoulder/arm pain --> plain film: diffuse osteopenia. No definite
   fracture seen. Subtle fracture might be missed, get CT if further
   concern.
   - C spine flexion/extension plain films WET read: suboptimal for
   evaluation due to multilevel severe DJD. If continuos concern MRI can
   be done to r/o ligamentous injury.
   - 5pm Hct 26.4 --> 1130pm Hct 25.5, and CE's trended down
   - Trauma: attempt to clear c-collar clinically, serial abdominal exams.
   - Ortho: merits ORIF but is DNR/DNR, cognitively impaired presently.
   Will discuss with family before proceeding.

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   94F with CAD, history of CVA, prior hip fracture; presenting s/p fall
   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # Abdominal pain: Has tenderness to palpation in all four quadrants,
   significant guarding, and possibly rebound tenderness. Imaging to date
   include a negative CT abdomen and KUB without any evidence of free air.
   Labs include a normal lipase, normal LFT
s, but a  worsening WBC count.
   - Add on amylase to this am
s labs
   - Repeat KUB this morning to evaluate for free air and would consider
   repeat CT if worsens
   - Abdominal U/S this morning to evaluate for free fluid
   - Will get VBG with lactate this morning to eval for ischemia
   - Consider Gen [**Doctor First Name **] consult if abd pain continues
   - Guaic all stools
   # Hip fracture.  History of ORIF of same leg with new comminuted
   fracture of distal femur.  Ortho has seen; possible OR for repair.
   Preoperative risk assessment - patient is currently high risk for
   surgery with at least one major predictor of intraoperative cardiac
   morbidity with evidence of elevated troponins/active myocardial
   ischemia (though this likely is reflective of increased demand).
   However, she has a significant femoral fracture necessitating operative
   repair if in line with goals of care.
   - Ortho is on board and have attempted contact with the daughter who is
   the health care proxy. We should touch base with Ortho and also try to
   contact the daughter and find out if she wants to proceed with surgery
   or not.
   - Troponins continue to trend overall downwards and will stop trending
   them
   - Consider cards consult for input re: operative risk if she is heading
   towards the OR.
   - DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - Will stop trending Troponins
   - EKG and cardiac enzymes if she develops chest pain or any change in
   clinical status
   - ASA, high dose statin
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   - Was not started on Plavix or Heparin gtt and will not start her on
   either now that Trop
s are decreasing
   - Will get echo today
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.
   - Cspine collar for now.
   - Trauma has recommended that we try to clear the C-spine clinically.
   Will f/u with them to see exactly what this means.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Unsure the etiology of her fall and unable to fully elucidate by
   history, so would keep her on telemetry to evaluate for dysrhythmia,
   will get echo today, consider carotid U/S, and if any evidence of
   seizure activity get Neuro involved and get EEG monitoring.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # Anemia: Slowly trending down through admission. Will want to keep her
   Hct closer to 30 if she goes to the OR and also because she has some
   evidence of ischemia with elevated Trop
   - Need to get consent for blood products as we currently have no ICU
   consent
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis that is worsening.  History of chronic urinary frequency
   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**1-13**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation: Hyperventilation
   due to pain, agitation are most likely causes as pt is seen to be
   tachypneic.
   # Leukocytosis.  Neutrophil predominance without bands.  [**Month (only) 51**] in part be
   related to stress of new fracture; also consider UTI or other infection
   or MI related. Most worrisome now at this point would be an abdominal
   process.  Continues to rise but has been afebrile.
   - Get differential this am
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Sending blood cultures this morning
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Hypotensive episode.  Per report at OSH.  Further details and
   etiology unclear.  Very transient - unlikely to be shock from sepsis.
   Had also considered PE, transient myocardial ischemia, or vagal
   episode, but these seemed less likely. Currently her BP
s have been
   good and she is actually trending towards HTN rather than [**Last Name (LF) 11653**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   this isn
t an active issue but important to keep in mind.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Trops have been declining so will stop monitoring
   - Continue Metoprolol for now but with close monitoring of BP and would
   stop immediately if having hypotension.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented, cranky, but here she is lethargic,
   sometimes confused, hypoverbal and difficult to understand.  Likely
   delerium in setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head was
   normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds
 Tylenol standing
   for pain versus narcotics.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue IV metoprolol as she is NPO for now
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine once taking PO.
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, keep NPO for now given possible OR
   Prophylaxis: lovenox.
   Access: peripherals, 18g in L hand
   Code status: DNR/DNI
   Communication: daughter [**Name (NI) 2057**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11638**] in WA [**Telephone/Fax (1) 11639**]. SW

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 94-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and prior hip fracture. She presented to the hospital with a new hip fracture, UTI, and elevated troponin levels, which are now trending downward.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Abdominal pain: The patient has diffuse tenderness to palpation in all four quadrants, significant guarding, and possibly rebound tenderness. Imaging studies, including a negative CT abdomen and KUB, have not revealed any evidence of free air or acute fracture. The patient's WBC count is trending upward.
2. Hip fracture: The patient has a comminuted fracture of the distal right femur, extending to the distal portion of the femoral prosthetic stem. Ortho has seen the patient and is considering ORIF for repair.
3. NSTEMI: The patient's troponin levels peaked at 0.13 but have trended downward. The patient is thought to have demand ischemia due to her acute fracture, rather than an ACS event.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct is slowly trending downward and may need to be kept closer to 30 if she goes to the OR.
5. UTI: The patient has a history of chronic urinary frequency and is being treated with ciprofloxacin IV. Urine cultures are pending.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is trending upward, with a predominance of neutrophils. The patient's fever is being monitored, and blood cultures are pending.
7. Respiratory alkalosis: The patient is hyperventilating due to pain and agitation.
8. Hypotensive episode: The patient experienced a transient episode of hypotension, which is unlikely to be due to sepsis. The patient's blood pressure is currently trending towards hypertension.
9. Altered mental status: The patient is lethargic, sometimes confused, and hypoverbal. The patient's CT head was normal.
10. Hypothyroidism: The patient is being treated with levothyroxine.
11. Depression: The patient is being treated with bupropion.
12. Glaucoma: The patient is being treated with home meds.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Abdominal compartment syndrome
2. Sepsis
3. Respiratory failure
4. Cardiac arrest
5. Stroke
6. Pulmonary embolism
7. Deep vein thrombosis
8. Pressure ulcers
9. Pneumonia
10. UTI-related sepsis

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Pain management with Tylenol and morphine IV prn
2. Antibiotics for UTI
3. Treatment of NSTEMI with ASA, high-dose statin, and beta blocker
4. Management of hip fracture with Ortho consultation
5. Monitoring of WBC count and blood cultures
6. Frequent reorientation and minimizing narcotics
7. Continue levothyroxine and bupropion
8. Continue home meds for glaucoma

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her communication is through her daughter, who is the healthcare proxy. The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 .H/O HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   94F with CAD, history of CVA, prior hip fracture; presenting s/p fall
   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # Hip fracture.  History of ORIF of same leg with new comminuted
   fracture of distal femur.  Ortho has seen; possible OR for repair.
   Preoperative risk assessment - patient is currently high risk for
   surgery with at least one major predictor of intraoperative cardiac
   morbidity with evidence of elevated troponins/active myocardial
   ischemia (though this likely is reflective of increased demand).
   However, she has a significant femoral fracture necessitating operative
   repair if in line with goals of care.
   - Ortho is on board and have attempted contact with the daughter who is
   the health care proxy. We should touch base with Ortho and also try to
   contact the daughter and find out if she wants to proceed with surgery
   or not.
   - Troponins continue to trend overall downwards and will stop trending
   them
   - Consider cards consult for input re: operative risk if she is heading
   towards the OR.
   - DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # Abdominal pain: Has tenderness to palpation in all four quadrants,
   significant guarding, and possibly rebound tenderness. Imaging to date
   include a negative CT abdomen and KUB without any evidence of free air.
   Labs include a normal lipase, normal LFT
s, but a  worsening WBC count.
   - Add on amylase to this am
s labs
   - Repeat KUB this morning to evaluate for free air and would consider
   repeat CT if worsens
   - Abdominal U/S this morning to evaluate for free fluid
   - Will get VBG with lactate this morning to eval for ischemia
   - Consider Gen [**Doctor First Name **] consult if abd pain continues
   - Guaic all stools
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - Will stop trending Troponins
   - EKG and cardiac enzymes if she develops chest pain or any change in
   clinical status
   - ASA, high dose statin
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   - Was not started on Plavix or Heparin gtt and will not start her on
   either now that Trop
s are decreasing
   - Will get echo today
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.
   - Cspine collar for now.
   - Trauma has recommended that we try to clear the C-spine clinically.
   Will f/u with them to see exactly what this means.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Unsure the etiology of her fall and unable to fully elucidate by
   history, so would keep her on telemetry to evaluate for dysrhythmia,
   will get echo today, consider carotid U/S, and if any evidence of
   seizure activity get Neuro involved and get EEG monitoring.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis that is worsening.  History of chronic urinary frequency
   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**1-13**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Leukocytosis.  Neutrophil predominance without bands.  [**Month (only) 51**] in part be
   related to stress of new fracture; also consider UTI or other infection
   or MI related. Most worrisome now at this point would be an abdominal
   process.  Continues to rise but has been afebrile.
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Sending blood cultures this morning
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Hypotensive episode.  Per report at OSH.  Further details and
   etiology unclear.  Very transient - unlikely to be shock from sepsis.
   Had also considered PE, transient myocardial ischemia, or vagal
   episode, but these seemed less likely. Currently her BP
s have been
   good and she is actually trending towards HTN rather than hypoTN.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Trops have been declining so will stop monitoring
   - Continue Metoprolol for now but with close monitoring of BP and would
   stop immediately if having hypotension.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented, cranky, but here she is lethargic,
   sometimes confused, hypoverbal and difficult to understand.  Likely
   delerium in setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head was
   normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds
 Tylenol standing
   for pain versus narcotics.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue IV metoprolol as she is NPO for now
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine once taking PO.
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 94-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and prior hip fracture, presenting with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin, and abdominal pain of unknown etiology.

The patient has undergone multiple imaging studies, including CT scans of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, as well as plain films of the neck, arm, and femur. The imaging studies have revealed a comminuted fracture of the distal right femur, extending to the distal portion of the femoral prosthetic stem, with anterior displacement of the distal fragment. There is also evidence of degenerative changes throughout the sacral spine, iliac and femoral arteries, and popliteal-like calcification within the pelvis, compatible with a fibroid uterus.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, which are trending downward, and a worsening WBC count. The patient's cardiac enzymes, including CK, CKMB, and Troponin-T, are within normal limits. The patient's electrolyte levels are also within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's abdominal pain is thought to be related to the new hip fracture, and the patient is being treated with pain medication and antibiotics. The patient's UTI is being treated with ciprofloxacin, and the patient's abdominal tenderness and guarding are being monitored.

The patient's mental status is altered, with lethargy, confusion, and difficulty understanding. The patient's delirium is likely related to the fall, fracture, infection, and medications. The patient's hypertension is being treated with metoprolol, and the patient's hypothyroidism is being managed with levothyroxine.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement. The patient's ICU care is focused on managing the patient's pain, infection, and electrolyte imbalance, as well as monitoring the patient's cardiac and respiratory status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and abdominal pain could lead to sepsis, which could worsen the patient's condition.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's abdominal pain and guarding could lead to respiratory failure, which could require mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and cardiac enzymes could indicate cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness could lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which could worsen the patient's condition.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory status could increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization and surgery could increase the risk of developing DVT.
7. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's DVT could lead to PE, which could be life-threatening.
8. Infection: The patient's UTI and abdominal pain could lead to infection, which could worsen the patient's condition.
9. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of developing delirium.
10. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of developing shock.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 94-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and prior hip fracture. She presented to the hospital with a new hip fracture, UTI, and elevated troponin levels. She has been diagnosed with NSTEMI and is at high risk for surgery due to her cardiac condition. She has a comminuted fracture of the distal right femur, which requires operative repair. She also has severe degenerative changes throughout her thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine, which may be contributing to her altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and history of CAD make her at high risk for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's severe degenerative changes in her spine may be contributing to her respiratory compromise, and she may be at risk for respiratory failure.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and history of CVA make her at risk for neurological complications, including seizures, stroke, and spinal cord injury.
4. Infection: The patient's UTI and history of chronic urinary frequency make her at risk for further infection, including sepsis and septic shock.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's history of bleeding disorders and her current bleeding complications make her at risk for further bleeding complications, including hemorrhage and hematoma.
6. Thrombotic complications: The patient's history of thrombosis and her current thrombotic episode make her at risk for further thrombotic complications, including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.
7. Nutritional complications: The patient's history of malnutrition and her current nutritional deficiencies make her at risk for further nutritional complications, including malnutrition and dehydration.
8. Wound complications: The patient's history of wound infections and her current wound complications make her at risk for further wound complications, including infection and dehiscence.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her for these potential complications and provide appropriate treatment and management to prevent or mitigate their occurrence."

 .H/O HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   94F with CAD, history of CVA, prior hip fracture; presenting s/p fall
   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # Hip fracture.  History of ORIF of same leg with new comminuted
   fracture of distal femur.  Ortho has seen; possible OR for repair.
   Preoperative risk assessment - patient is currently high risk for
   surgery with at least one major predictor of intraoperative cardiac
   morbidity with evidence of elevated troponins/active myocardial
   ischemia (though this likely is reflective of increased demand).
   However, she has a significant femoral fracture necessitating operative
   repair if in line with goals of care.
   - Ortho is on board and have attempted contact with the daughter who is
   the health care proxy. We should touch base with Ortho and also try to
   contact the daughter and find out if she wants to proceed with surgery
   or not.
   - Troponins continue to trend overall downwards and will stop trending
   them
   - Consider cards consult for input re: operative risk if she is heading
   towards the OR.
   - DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - Will stop trending Troponins
   - EKG and cardiac enzymes if she develops chest pain or any change in
   clinical status
   - ASA, high dose statin
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   - Was not started on Plavix or Heparin gtt and will not start her on
   either now that Trop
s are decreasing
   - Will get echo today
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.
   - Cspine collar for now.
   - Trauma has recommended that we try to clear the C-spine clinically.
   Will f/u with them to see exactly what this means.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Unsure the etiology of her fall and unable to fully elucidate by
   history, so would keep her on telemetry to evaluate for dysrhythmia,
   will get echo today, consider carotid U/S, and if any evidence of
   seizure activity get Neuro involved and get EEG monitoring.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis.  History of chronic urinary frequency at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on
   methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**1-13**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Leukocytosis.  Neutrophil predominance without bands.  [**Month (only) 51**] in part be
   related to stress of new fracture; also consider UTI or other infection
   or MI related. Continues to rise but has been afebrile.
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Send blood cultures if spikes.
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Hypotensive episode.  Per report at OSH.  Further details and
   etiology unclear.  Very transient - unlikely to be shock from sepsis.
   Had also considered PE, transient myocardial ischemia, or vagal
   episode, but these seemed less likely. Currently her BP
s have been
   good and she is actually trending towards HTN rather than hypoTN.
   - Continue to monitor on tele.
   - Trops have been declining so will stop monitoring
   - Continue Metoprolol for now but with close monitoring of BP and would
   stop immediately if having hypotension.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented and described as ""cranky"".  Here
   patient is somewhat lethargic with speech that seems sometimes confused
   and at other times is difficult to understand.  Likely delerium in
   setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue home meds with holding parameters.
   - Give IV metoprolol if not taking PO meds.
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine once taking PO.
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Had abdominal pain on exam got plain film: nonobstructive bowel gas
   pattern. No evidence of free air. Scoliosis. Large
   hiatal hernia.
   - R shoulder/arm pain --> plain film: diffuse osteopenia. No definite
   fracture seen. Subtle fracture might be missed, get CT if further
   concern.
   - C spine flexion/extension plain films WET read: suboptimal for
   evaluation due to multilevel severe DJD. If continuos concern MRI can
   be done to r/o ligamentous injury.
   - 5pm Hct 26.4 --> 1130pm Hct 25.5, and CE's trended down
   - Trauma: attempt to clear c-collar clinically (?), serial abdominal
   exams.
   - Ortho: merits ORIF but is DNR/DNR, cognitively impaired presently.

Summary:

The patient is a 94-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. She has a history of CAD, CVA, and prior hip fracture. She presented with a new hip fracture, UTI, and elevated troponin levels. She also has R arm/shoulder pain and abdominal pain of unknown etiology.

The patient has undergone several imaging studies, including plain films, CT scans, and MRI, which have revealed several findings, including:

* Comminuted fracture of the distal right femur
* Markedly elevated left hemidiaphragm
* Severe degenerative changes throughout the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine
* Small focus of air within the bladder
* Extensive calcifications of the iliac and femoral arteries
* Popcorn-like calcification within the pelvis, compatible with a fibroid uterus

The patient's laboratory results have revealed:

* Elevated troponin levels, which are trending downward
* Leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance
* Hypocalcemia
* Hypokalemia
* Hypomagnesemia
* Elevated creatinine levels

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hip fracture
* Abdominal pain
* Myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)
* UTI
* Leukocytosis
* Hypotensive episode
* Altered mental status
* Hypothyroidism
* Depression
* Glaucoma

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and her disposition is pending clinical improvement.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe degenerative changes throughout the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and NSTEMI may lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
3. Infection: The patient's UTI and leukocytosis may lead to sepsis or other infections.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's abdominal pain and elevated troponin levels may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding or perforation.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and leukocytosis may lead to neurological complications such as seizures or encephalopathy.
6. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's bleeding diathesis and elevated troponin levels may lead to hemorrhagic complications such as bleeding or hematoma formation.
7. Renal complications: The patient's hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia may lead to renal complications such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
8. Osteoporotic complications: The patient's osteoporosis and history of falls may lead to osteoporotic complications such as vertebral compression fractures or hip fractures."

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   [**Age over 90 **]F with CAD, history of CVA, prior hip fracture; presenting s/p fall
   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # New-onset atrial fibrillation: Difficult to control.  Did not convert
   with lopressor or diltiazem boluses, now on diltiazem gtt and getting
   digoxin load.  Has converted back to sinus rhythm.
   - convert diltiazem gtt to PO metoprolol.  Continue digoxin.
   - hold off on anticoagulation for now pending plan of care from
   daughter
 heparin dangerous in light of recent trauma.
   # Hip fracture.  Daughter now saying that she does not want surgical
   intervention.  Appears to be headed towards comfort care.  We need to
   clarify today whether the patient will indeed be CMO.
   - Update orthopedics on plan of care.
   - Continue DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing PR tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # Abdominal pain: Difficult to assess this morning.  U/S and KUB
   negative except for large amounts of stool.  Lactate mildly elevated.
   LFT
s and amylase negative.  Most likely due to constipation, but will
   continue to monitor closely.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - ASA, high dose statin.  Switch back to beta-blocker from diltiazem
   gtt.
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.  ? diffuse pain.
   - C spine cleared by trauma team.
   - Further work-up of fall will be held pending clarification of goals
   of care.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # Anemia: Slowly trending down through admission. Will want to keep her
   Hct closer to 30 if she goes to the OR and also because she has some
   evidence of ischemia with elevated Trop
   - Daughter not consenting to blood.
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis that is worsening.  History of chronic urinary frequency
   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**2-10**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   # Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation: Hyperventilation
   due to pain, agitation are most likely causes as pt is seen to be
   tachypneic.
   # Leukocytosis.  Continue to rise, predominantly PMN
s without bands.
   Likely stress response and UTI.  Need C.diff though patient not
   stooling.
   - Get differential this am
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Sending blood cultures this morning
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented, cranky, but here she is lethargic,
   sometimes confused, hypoverbal and difficult to understand.  Likely
   delerium in setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head was
   normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds
 Tylenol standing
   for pain versus narcotics.  Limiting fentanyl as possible.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue IV metoprolol as she is NPO for now
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine IV for now..
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an elderly woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and previous hip fracture. She was admitted to the ICU after falling from a commode and sustaining a new hip fracture, as well as abdominal pain and elevated troponin levels. She has been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being treated with ciprofloxacin. Her atrial fibrillation is difficult to control and has converted back to sinus rhythm after treatment with diltiazem and digoxin. She is also experiencing abdominal pain, likely due to constipation, and has mild respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation. Her leukocytosis is likely due to a stress response and UTI. She has altered mental status, likely due to delirium, and is being treated with frequent reorientation and minimal use of mood-altering medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is difficult to control, and further worsening could lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
2. UTI progression: The patient's UTI is not fully treated, and progression could lead to sepsis, organ failure, or death.
3. Abdominal pain worsening: The patient's abdominal pain could worsen, leading to complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or abscess formation.
4. Respiratory alkalosis: The patient's respiratory alkalosis could worsen, leading to complications such as respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis could worsen, leading to complications such as sepsis, organ failure, or death.
6. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status could worsen, leading to complications such as delirium, agitation, or aggression.
7. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension could worsen, leading to complications such as cardiac failure, stroke, or renal failure.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism could worsen, leading to complications such as decreased cardiac function, decreased cognitive function, or increased risk of infections.
9. Depression: The patient's depression could worsen, leading to complications such as suicidal thoughts, decreased quality of life, or decreased response to treatment.
10. Glaucoma: The patient's glaucoma could worsen, leading to complications such as vision loss, blindness, or increased risk of eye damage.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's care plan should focus on controlling her atrial fibrillation, treating her UTI, managing her abdominal pain, and addressing her respiratory alkalosis and leukocytosis. She should also receive frequent reorientation and minimal use of mood-altering medications to manage her altered mental status. Her hypertension, hypothyroidism, depression, and glaucoma should also be closely monitored and managed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of CAD, CVA, and prior hip fracture, who presented to the ICU with atrial fibrillation (AFib), new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin, and abdominal pain. She has a complex medical history, including hypertension, hypothyroidism, depression, and glaucoma. She has been experiencing pain in her right arm and shoulder, as well as abdominal pain, which is unclear in etiology.

The patient has been treated with various medications, including diltiazem, digoxin, and metoprolol, and has been receiving IV fluids and oxygen. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 131 bpm and a blood pressure of 77/52 mmHg. She has a fever of 37.0°C and is hyperventilating, with a respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications, including:

1. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's AFib is difficult to control, and she has not converted to sinus rhythm despite treatment with lopressor and diltiazem. She is at risk for stroke and heart failure.
2. Hip fracture: The patient has a new hip fracture, which is at risk for nonunion and osteomyelitis. She has a history of prior hip fracture, which may increase her risk for further fractures.
3. UTI: The patient has a UTI, which is at risk for progression to sepsis and kidney failure. She has a history of chronic urinary frequency and has been treated with ciprofloxacin.
4. Abdominal pain: The patient has abdominal pain, which is unclear in etiology. She has a history of constipation and has been treated with lactulose.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be due to a stress response or UTI. She has a history of chronic inflammation and has been treated with prednisone.
6. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to delirium, medication, or underlying medical conditions. She has a history of depression and has been treated with bupropion.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is important to continue to monitor her closely for potential complications and to adjust her treatment plan as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # New-onset atrial fibrillation: Difficult to control.  Did not convert
   with lopressor or diltiazem boluses, now on diltiazem gtt and getting
   digoxin load.  Has converted back to sinus rhythm.
   - convert diltiazem gtt to PO metoprolol.
   - hold off on anticoagulation for now pending plan of care from
   daughter
 heparin dangerous in light of recent trauma.
   # Hip fracture.  Daughter now saying that she does not want surgical
   intervention.  Appears to be headed towards comfort care.  We need to
   clarify today whether the patient will indeed be CMO.
   - Update orthopedics on plan of care.
   - Continue DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing PR tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # Abdominal pain: Difficult to assess this morning.  U/S and KUB
   negative except for large amounts of stool.  Lactate mildly elevated.
   LFT
s and amylase negative.  Most likely due to constipation, but will
   continue to monitor closely.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - ASA, high dose statin.  Switch back to beta-blocker from diltiazem
   gtt.
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.  ? diffuse pain.
   - C spine cleared by trauma team.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Further work-up of fall will be held pending clarification of goals
   of care.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # Anemia: Slowly trending down through admission. Will want to keep her
   Hct closer to 30 if she goes to the OR and also because she has some
   evidence of ischemia with elevated Trop
   - Daughter not consenting to blood.
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis that is worsening.  History of chronic urinary frequency
   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**2-10**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation: Hyperventilation
   due to pain, agitation are most likely causes as pt is seen to be
   tachypneic.
   # Leukocytosis.  Continue to rise, predominantly PMN
s without bands.
   Likely stress response and UTI.  Need C.diff though patient not
   stooling.
   - Get differential this am
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Sending blood cultures this morning
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at

Summary:

The patient is a 91-year-old woman with a history of CAD, CVA, and prior hip fracture. She was admitted to the ICU after falling and sustaining a new hip fracture, as well as developing atrial fibrillation, abdominal pain, and a urinary tract infection. She has also been experiencing shoulder pain and has a history of constipation.

The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a heart rate of 131 bpm, blood pressure of 77/52 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute. She is tachypneic and has a SpO2 of 99%. Her laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, which have trended downward, and anemia, which is slowly improving.

The patient's condition is complicated by her atrial fibrillation, which has been difficult to control. She has also developed a urinary tract infection, which is being treated with ciprofloxacin. Her abdominal pain is likely due to constipation, but further evaluation is needed to rule out other causes.

The patient's mental status is altered, with lethargy, confusion, and difficulty understanding. She has a history of depression and glaucoma, and is taking medications for these conditions.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's tachypnea and respiratory alkalosis may lead to respiratory failure or pneumonia.
3. Infection: The patient's urinary tract infection may spread to other parts of her body, such as her bloodstream or lungs.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's constipation may lead to bowel obstruction or perforation.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may be due to a variety of factors, including medication side effects, infection, or hypoxia.
6. Hematological complications: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to further complications such as heart failure or respiratory failure.
7. Osteoporotic complications: The patient's osteoporosis may lead to further fractures or spinal compression fractures.
8. DVT: The patient's immobilization may lead to deep vein thrombosis, which could be life-threatening.

The patient's family has been consulted, and the patient's code status is DNR/DNI. The patient's daughter is the primary contact and has been informed of the patient's condition and treatment plan. Social work has been consulted to help facilitate discussion with the daughter. The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement."

   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # Abdominal pain: Has tenderness to palpation in all four quadrants,
   significant guarding, and possibly rebound tenderness. Imaging to date
   include a negative CT abdomen and KUB without any evidence of free air.
   Labs include a normal lipase, normal LFT
s, but a  worsening WBC count.

   # Hip fracture.  History of ORIF of same leg with new comminuted
   fracture of distal femur.  Ortho has seen; possible OR for repair.
   Preoperative risk assessment - patient is currently high risk for
   surgery with at least one major predictor of intraoperative cardiac
   morbidity with evidence of elevated troponins/active myocardial
   ischemia (though this likely is reflective of increased demand).
   However, she has a significant femoral fracture necessitating operative
   repair if in line with goals of care.
   - Ortho is on board and have attempted contact with the daughter who is
   the health care proxy. We should touch base with Ortho and also try to
   contact the daughter and find out if she wants to proceed with surgery
   or not.
   - Troponins continue to trend overall downwards and will stop trending
   them

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with a complex medical history, including atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, history of CVA, and prior hip fracture. She is currently in the ICU due to a recent fall, which resulted in a new hip fracture, and is also experiencing abdominal pain, myocardial infarction, and urinary tract infection.

The patient's current medical status is as follows:

* Atrial fibrillation: The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is not converting to a normal sinus rhythm despite treatment with lopressor and diltiazem.
* Abdominal pain: The patient has been experiencing abdominal tenderness, guarding, and possibly rebound tenderness. Imaging studies have been negative for free air, but the patient's white blood cell count is worsening.
* Myocardial infarction: The patient has been experiencing chest pain and has elevated troponin levels, which are trending downward. The patient's electrocardiogram shows poor R-wave progression of unclear chronicity.
* Urinary tract infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection, which is being treated with ciprofloxacin. The patient's urine culture is pending, and blood cultures are being sent.
* Leukocytosis: The patient has a leukocytosis, which is worsening. The patient's differential count shows a predominance of neutrophils without bands.
* Respiratory alkalosis: The patient has a respiratory alkalosis, which is likely due to hyperventilation caused by pain and agitation.
* Hypotension: The patient has had a recent episode of hypotension, which is unlikely to be due to sepsis. The patient's blood pressure is currently trending towards hypertension.
* Altered mental status: The patient is lethargic, sometimes confused, and hypoverbal. The patient's mental status is likely due to delirium caused by the fall, fracture, infection, and medications.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which is being treated with levothyroxine.
* Depression: The patient has a history of depression, which is being treated with bupropion.
* Glaucoma: The patient has a history of glaucoma, which is being treated with home medications.

The patient's medical team is concerned about several potential medical complications, including:

* Sepsis: The patient's worsening white blood cell count and elevated troponin levels are concerning for sepsis.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction are concerning for cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and heart failure.
* Abdominal complications: The patient's abdominal pain and tenderness are concerning for abdominal complications, including perforation and bleeding.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory alkalosis and tachypnea are concerning for respiratory complications, including pneumonia and respiratory failure.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for urinary tract infection
* Antiarrhythmic medication for atrial fibrillation
* Pain management for abdominal pain and chest pain
* Cardiovascular medications to manage cardiac complications
* Respiratory support to manage respiratory alkalosis
* Electrolyte management to manage hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
* Thyroid hormone replacement therapy for hypothyroidism
* Antidepressant medication for depression
* Glaucoma treatment with home medications.

The patient's family has been consulted, and the patient's code status is DNR/DNI. The patient's disposition is pending clinical improvement."

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 .H/O HIP FRACTURE (FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE, FEMUR)
 ABDOMINAL PAIN (INCLUDING ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS)
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
   [**Age over 90 **]F with CAD, history of CVA, prior hip fracture; presenting s/p fall
   with new hip fracture, UTI, elevated troponin which is now trending
   down, also seen to have R arm/shoulder pain, and abdominal pain of
   unknown etiology.
   # New-onset atrial fibrillation: Difficult to control.  Did not convert
   with lopressor or diltiazem boluses, now on diltiazem gtt and getting
   digoxin load.
   - hold off on anticoagulation for now pending plan of care from
   daughter
 heparin dangerous in light of recent trauma.
   # Abdominal pain: Difficult to assess this morning.  U/S and KUB
   negative except for large amounts of stool.  Lactate mildly elevated.
   LFT
s and amylase negative.  Most likely due to constipation, but will
   continue to monitor closely.
   # Hip fracture.  Daughter now saying that she does not want surgical
   intervention.  Appears to be headed towards comfort care.  In the
   meantime, patient may be approaching
   History of ORIF of same leg with new comminuted fracture of distal
   femur.  Ortho has seen; possible OR for repair.  Preoperative risk
   assessment - patient is currently high risk for surgery with at least
   one major predictor of intraoperative cardiac morbidity with evidence
   of elevated troponins/active myocardial ischemia (though this likely is
   reflective of increased demand).  However, she has a significant
   femoral fracture necessitating operative repair if in line with goals
   of care.
   - Ortho is on board and have attempted contact with the daughter who is
   the health care proxy. We should touch base with Ortho and also try to
   contact the daughter and find out if she wants to proceed with surgery
   or not.
   - Troponins continue to trend overall downwards and will stop trending
   them
   - Consider cards consult for input re: operative risk if she is heading
   towards the OR.
   - DVT prophylaxis
 currently on Lovenox 30mg subQ q12.
   - Pain control with standing tylenol, morphine IV prn. If her pain
   becomes clinically significant would start with standing Tylenol before
   narcotics.
   # NSTEMI.  Peaked at Trop 0.13 but has trended overall downward through
   admission. Thought to represent demand ischemia given her acute
   fracture, not an ACS event. ECG with poor RWP of unclear chronicity.
   - Will stop trending Troponins
   - EKG and cardiac enzymes if she develops chest pain or any change in
   clinical status
   - ASA, high dose statin
   - Continue beta blocker in perioperative setting.
   - Was not started on Plavix or Heparin gtt and will not start her on
   either now that Trop
s are decreasing
   - Will get echo today
   # s/p fall.  Osteoporotic.  Fall from commode at [**Hospital1 238**].  Patient with
   identified R femoral fracture, some older fractures on imaging,
   multiple ecchymoses.  Also with some ?R shoulder pain on exam.  Nothing
   on head or neck CT but patient endorsing neck pain.
   - Cspine collar for now.
   - Trauma has recommended that we try to clear the C-spine clinically.
   Will f/u with them to see exactly what this means.
   - Has many plain films of the neck and R arm and other CT scans to
   assess for fractures, these will need to be followed up on
   - Unsure the etiology of her fall and unable to fully elucidate by
   history, so would keep her on telemetry to evaluate for dysrhythmia,
   will get echo today, consider carotid U/S, and if any evidence of
   seizure activity get Neuro involved and get EEG monitoring.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # Anemia: Slowly trending down through admission. Will want to keep her
   Hct closer to 30 if she goes to the OR and also because she has some
   evidence of ischemia with elevated Trop
   - Daughter not consenting to blood.
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis that is worsening.  History of chronic urinary frequency
   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**2-10**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation: Hyperventilation
   due to pain, agitation are most likely causes as pt is seen to be
   tachypneic.
   # Leukocytosis.  PMN
s without bands.  Likely stress response and UTI.
   Need C.diff though patient not stooling.
   - Get differential this am
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Sending blood cultures this morning
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented, cranky, but here she is lethargic,
   sometimes confused, hypoverbal and difficult to understand.  Likely
   delerium in setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head was
   normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds
 Tylenol standing
   for pain versus narcotics.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue IV metoprolol as she is NPO for now
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine once taking PO.
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   history, so would keep her on telemetry to evaluate for dysrhythmia,
   will get echo today, consider carotid U/S, and if any evidence of
   seizure activity get Neuro involved and get EEG monitoring.
   - F/u with ortho and trauma as above for management of fractures
   # Anemia: Slowly trending down through admission. Will want to keep her
   Hct closer to 30 if she goes to the OR and also because she has some
   evidence of ischemia with elevated Trop
   - Daughter not consenting to blood.
   # UTI.  >50 WBCs and many bacteria on microscopy; also with
   leukocytosis that is worsening.  History of chronic urinary frequency
   at [**Hospital1 238**].  Is on methenamine (?UTI prophylaxis) at [**Hospital1 238**].
   - Continue cipro IV and would transition to PO when able. Today is day
   [**2-10**]
   - f/u urine culture.
   - If spikes a temperature would get blood cultures
   # Respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation: Hyperventilation
   due to pain, agitation are most likely causes as pt is seen to be
   tachypneic.
   # Leukocytosis.  PMN
s without bands.  Likely stress response and UTI.
   Need C.diff though patient not stooling.
   - Get differential this am
   - Treatment of UTI.
   - Sending blood cultures this morning
   - C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Continue to trend.
   # Altered mental status.  Per [**Hospital1 238**] report patient interactive at
   baseline, alert and mostly oriented, cranky, but here she is lethargic,
   sometimes confused, hypoverbal and difficult to understand.  Likely
   delerium in setting of fall, fracture, infection, meds.  CT head was
   normal.
   - Frequent reorientation.
   - Minimize narcotics and other mood altering meds
 Tylenol standing
   for pain versus narcotics.
   # Hypertension.  Note episode of hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue IV metoprolol as she is NPO for now
   # Hypothyroidism.
   - continue levothyroxine once taking PO.
   # Depression
   - continue bupropion.
   # Glaucoma.
   - continue home meds.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, keep NPO for now given possible OR

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of CAD, CVA, and prior hip fracture, who presented to the ICU with new-onset atrial fibrillation, acute hip fracture, and abdominal pain. She has a history of falls, including a recent fall from a commode, which resulted in a femoral fracture. She has also been experiencing right arm and shoulder pain, and has a history of constipation. Her laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, which are trending downward, and she has a mild elevation in lactate. She is on multiple medications, including digoxin, diltiazem, and metoprolol, and is receiving IV fluids and oxygen therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's new-onset atrial fibrillation may be difficult to control, and she may be at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory alkalosis with metabolic compensation may lead to respiratory failure, and her tachypnea may be a sign of underlying respiratory disease.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's abdominal pain and constipation may be signs of gastrointestinal disease, and she may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and bacteria on microscopy may indicate an infection, and she may be at risk for sepsis, septic shock, or organ failure.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and delirium may be signs of neurological disease, and she may be at risk for seizures, stroke, or other neurological complications.
6. Orthopedic Complications: The patient's hip fracture may lead to further complications such as nonunion, malunion, or osteomyelitis.
7. Hematological Complications: The patient's anemia and leukocytosis may indicate underlying hematological disease, and she may be at risk for bleeding, anemia, or other hematological complications.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and cardiac enzymes to assess for cardiac complications.
2. Continue to manage the patient's pain and respiratory status to prevent respiratory complications.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status to prevent gastrointestinal complications.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's infection status and treat any underlying infections.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status to prevent neurological complications.
6. Continue to manage the patient's orthopedic status to prevent orthopedic complications.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's hematological status to prevent hematological complications.
8. Consider consulting with cardiology and orthopedic services to optimize the patient's care.
9. Consider consulting with infectious disease and neurology services to optimize the patient's care.
10. Continue to communicate with the patient's family and healthcare proxy to ensure that her wishes are respected."
