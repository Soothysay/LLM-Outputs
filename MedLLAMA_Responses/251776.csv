   renal failure and profound acidosis
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to obtunded mental status, also with
   concern for PNA on chest x-ray.  Unknown past tobacco use or prior
   pulmonary history.
   - Obtain ABG
   - Decrease FIO2
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated CK [**Numeric Identifier 5119**] and found down.  Not reportedly on
   statin or other medication that would worsen this.  Thus, likely
   etiology, being found down, is now resolved.  No e/o viral infection or
   autoimmune myopathy at this point.
   - Given 1L D5W with 150 mEq HCO3 now
   - Monitoring serial measurements of serum potassium, calcium,
   phosphate, and creatinine
   .
   # AMS: Found down, initial GCS =3.  Previous AMS s/p seizures and had
   subtherapeutic phenytoin.  No e/o seizure but cannot rule-out NCSE.
   Also with continued alcohol withdrawal, metabolic abnormalities, and
   likely occult infection.
   - Versed for sedation, should treat possible DTs as well
   - EEG to r/o occult seizure
   - Consider Neuro consult
   - Final read head CT
   - Toxic-metabolic as above
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Multifactorial related to ARF with uremia, lactic
   acidosis, acoholic ketoacidosis.  Increased Osm gap to 17, but not
   greater than 25.  Likely related to alcoholic ketoacidosis, lactic
   acidosis and the presence of alcohol can alter the assay.
   - Renal
   .
   # Alcohol intoxication: Measurable level on admission.
   - Versed as above for sedation
   - Thiamine, folate
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely multifactorial etiology relating to
   prerenal status, hypovolemia, possibly ATN and then worsened by
   rhabdomyolysis and myoglobin induced nephropathy.
   - Agressive IVF as above
   - Bicarbonate as above
   - Renal consult
   - UA, lytes
   - Urine pH
   .
   #  Transaminitis: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to initial toxic insult, ischemia,
   alcohol intoxication or viral etiology.
   - Trend
   - IVF as above
   - Consider further work-up with viral etiology should it worsen
   - RUQ u/s
   .
   # Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 8**] be due to infection (PNA, biliary), aspiration
   pneumonitis or seizures. Blood cultures pending, UA at OSH negative.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* RR (spontaneous): 0 inspirations per minute
* PEEP: 5 cmH2O
* FiO2: 60%
* RSBI: 47
* PIP: 24 cmH2O
* Plateau: 14 cmH2O

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

* Respiratory failure: Secondary to obtunded mental status, concern for PNA on chest x-ray.
* Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated CK and found down, likely etiology being resolved.
* AMS: Found down, initial GCS = 3, previous AMS with seizures, and subtherapeutic phenytoin.
* Metabolic acidosis: Multifactorial, likely related to ARF with uremia, lactic acidosis, and alcohol ketoacidosis.
* Acute renal failure: Likely multifactorial etiology, relating to prerenal status, hypovolemia, possibly ATN and worsened by rhabdomyolysis and myoglobin-induced nephropathy.
* Transaminitis: Possible secondary to initial toxic insult, ischemia, alcohol intoxication, or viral etiology.
* Leukocytosis: Possible due to infection, aspiration pneumonitis, or seizures.
* Elevated troponin-T: Possible due to cardiac injury or rhabdomyolysis.
* Coffee ground emesis: Concern for this upon admission to OSH, guaiac negative here.
* Central arterial line: Left subclavian line in artery, to be left in place and pulled in OR once more clinically stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia
* Sepsis
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Rhabdomyolysis
* Acute kidney injury
* Metabolic acidosis
* Electrolyte abnormalities
* Seizures
* Stroke
* Infection
* DVT
* Stress ulcer
* VAP

It is crucial to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory support, and to adjust the plan as necessary to prevent or manage potential complications."

   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to obtunded mental status, also with
   concern for PNA on chest x-ray.  Unknown past tobacco use or prior
   pulmonary history.
   - Obtain ABG
   - Decrease FIO2
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated CK [**Numeric Identifier 5119**] and found down.  Not reportedly on
   statin or other medication that would worsen this.  Thus, likely
   etiology, being found down, is now resolved.  No e/o viral infection or
   autoimmune myopathy at this point.

   # Metabolic acidosis: Multifactorial related to ARF with uremia, lactic
   acidosis, acoholic ketoacidosis.  Increased Osm gap to 17, but not
   greater than 25.  Likely related to alcoholic ketoacidosis, lactic
   acidosis and the presence of alcohol can alter the assay.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with a history of ethanol abuse, bipolar disorder, and found down with empty alcohol bottles around him. He was intubated in the emergency department due to a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3. He has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, metabolic acidosis, and hyperglycemia. He is currently receiving invasive ventilation, multi-lumen, and midazolam infusions. His vital signs are stable, but his laboratory results show elevated creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and troponin levels, indicating possible rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels indicate AKI, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiovascular complications.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated CK and LDH levels indicate rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's elevated anion gap and lactate levels indicate metabolic acidosis, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and respiratory depression.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated glucose levels indicate hyperglycemia, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, and cardiovascular complications.
6. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels indicate sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction, septic shock, and death.
7. Arterial subclavian: The patient's arterial subclavian line is at risk of dislodging, which can lead to bleeding and cardiovascular complications.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to tolerate food and fluids due to his respiratory and cardiovascular status may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which can exacerbate his underlying conditions.
9. Delirium: The patient's sedation and potential electrolyte imbalances may lead to delirium, which can exacerbate his underlying conditions and increase his risk of falls and other complications.

Given the patient's critical condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   I have seen and examined the patient with the resident and agree with
   the assessment and plan as above with the following
   emphasis/modifications:
   67 year old male history of alcohol abuse and bipolar disorder who
   presents after being found down for unknown period of time.  Had GCS of
   3 and was intubated and brought to outside hospital.   HCT/neck CT
   negative and transferred to [**Hospital1 5**].
   Overnight, has been hypotensive on levophed and also in rhabdo, ARF
   receiving bicarb drip and volume resuscitation.  Also, note a
   subclavian line was placed by outside hospital into his subclavian
   artery.
   Labs as noted above and CXR with ETT in good position and no
   significant infiltrates.
   PE 98  120  BP 112/70 RR  18   Sat 98%
   Lactate 3.7
   Urine output now about 80cc/hour
   Still requiring levophed
   1)  Shock: probable sepsis but other etiologies possible and will
   obtain ECHO to help further discern.  Assuming septic shock, it is
   unclear of the source but could include abdominal, pneumonia
   2) Respiratory Failure
   3) Acidosis
   4) Rhabdomyolysis
   5) Acute Renal Failure
   6) Alcohol Abuse
   7) Malpositioned line in subclavian artery
   Plan:
   1) Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanc/zosyn/levo)
   2) CT scan to rule out abd source
   3) Place RIJ when feasible (need to rule repeat neck CT to rule
   fracture since no outside images available and then will place line)
   4) Vascular surgery for issue of malpositioned line
   5) Volume resuscitation for shock and rhabdo
 follow perfusion
   endpoints
   6) Thiamine
   Addendum: during the day, patient blood cultures grew gram negative
   bacteria futher emphasizing the need for abd ct scan to evaluate for
   source.  Given persistent hemodynamic instability and confirmed gram
   negatives, we will give a dose of gentamycin believing the benefit of
   using this [**Doctor Last Name **] for this life-threatening gram
 septic shock
   outweighs the nephrotoxic risk.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   67 year old male history of alcohol abuse and bipolar disorder who
   presents after being found down for unknown period of time.  Had GCS of

   negative and transferred to [**Hospital1 5**].
   Overnight, has been hypotensive on levophed and also in rhabdo, ARF
   receiving bicarb drip and volume resuscitation.  Also, note a
   subclavian line was placed by outside hospital into his subclavian
   artery.

   1)  Shock: probable sepsis but other etiologies possible and will
   obtain ECHO to help further discern.  Assuming septic shock, it is
   unclear of the source but could include abdominal, pneumonia
   2) Respiratory Failure
   3) Acidosis
   4) Rhabdomyolysis
   5) Acute Renal Failure
   6) Alcohol Abuse
   7) Malpositioned line in subclavian artery
   Plan:
   1) Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanc/zosyn/levo)
   2) CT scan to rule out abd source
   3) Place RIJ when feasible (need to rule repeat neck CT to rule
   fracture since no outside images available and then will place line)
   4) Vascular surgery for issue of malpositioned line
   5) Volume resuscitation for shock and rhabdo
 follow perfusion
   endpoints
   6) Thiamine
   Addendum: during the day, patient blood cultures grew gram negative
   bacteria futher emphasizing the need for abd ct scan to evaluate for
   source.  Given persistent hemodynamic instability and confirmed gram
   negatives, we will give a dose of gentamycin believing the benefit of
   using this [**Doctor Last Name **] for this life-threatening gram
 septic shock
   outweighs the nephrotoxic risk.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male who was found down with empty alcohol bottles around him. He was intubated in the emergency department due to a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 3. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, acidosis, and sepsis. The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and bipolar disorder.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.8°C (96.4°F)
* Heart rate: 114 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 129/53 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient has a multi-lumen catheter, arterial line, and central venous catheter. He is receiving insulin, midazolam, and levophed infusions.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 2.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 166 K/uL
* Creatinine: 4.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 96 mg/dL
* Glucose: 288 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 3.7 mmol/L

The patient's radiology results show:

* Chest X-ray: No significant infiltrates
* Head CT: Negative

The patient's plan includes:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics for sepsis
* CT scan to rule out abdominal source
* Placement of a right internal jugular (RIJ) line when feasible
* Vascular surgery for malpositioned line
* Volume resuscitation for shock and rhabdomyolysis
* Follow-up with perfusion endpoints

Potential medical complications:

1. Shock: The patient is at risk for septic shock, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen if not managed properly.
3. Acidosis: The patient's acidosis can lead to organ failure and death if not managed properly.
4. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's rhabdomyolysis can lead to kidney failure and death if not managed properly.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen if not managed properly.
6. Malpositioned line: The patient's malpositioned line can lead to complications such as bleeding and infection.
7. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis can worsen if not managed properly, leading to organ failure and death.
8. Gram-negative septic shock: The patient's gram-negative septic shock can worsen if not managed properly, leading to organ failure and death.

The patient's care requires close monitoring and management to prevent these complications and ensure the best possible outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with shock, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure (ARF). He has a history of alcohol abuse and has been treated with multiple antibiotics. The patient's condition has been complicated by fever, hypotension, and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 102.2°F
* Heart rate: 80 bpm
* Blood pressure: 139/65 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.4-7.6 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.9-10.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 245-183 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 4.1-4.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.19-0.43 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.7 g/dL
* LDH: 848 IU/L
* Ca++: 6.0 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.3 mg/dL
* PO4: 4.9 mg/dL

The patient's diagnosis includes:

* Sepsis, severe, with organ dysfunction
* Electrolyte and fluid disorder
* Hyperglycemia
* Acute renal failure
* Rhabdomyolysis
* Metabolic acidosis
* Respiratory failure, acute

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and cardiovascular instability
* Electrolyte imbalances, such as hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia
* Respiratory failure, which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Acute kidney injury, which can lead to chronic kidney disease
* Rhabdomyolysis, which can cause acute kidney injury and electrolyte imbalances
* Metabolic acidosis, which can worsen respiratory and cardiovascular function
* Hyperglycemia, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar nonketotic coma

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these complications and optimize his care."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo M found down, with alcohol intoxication, rhabdomyolysis, acute
   renal failure and profound acidosis
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to obtunded mental status, also with
   concern for PNA on chest x-ray.  Unknown past tobacco use or prior
   pulmonary history.
   - GPC in sputum, on vanco
   - Wean vent as tolerated
   .
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated CK [**Numeric Identifier 5119**] and found down.  Not reportedly on
   statin or other medication that would worsen this.  Thus, likely
   etiology, being found down, is now resolved.  No e/o viral infection or
   autoimmune myopathy at this point.
   - Aggressive hydration
   - Monitoring serial measurements of serum potassium, calcium,
   phosphate, and creatinine
   - CK trending down
   .
   # AMS: Found down, initial GCS =3.  Previous AMS s/p seizures and had
   subtherapeutic phenytoin.  No e/o seizure but cannot rule-out NCSE.
   Also with continued alcohol withdrawal, metabolic abnormalities, and
   likely occult infection.
   - Versed for sedation, should treat possible DTs as well
   - EEG to r/o occult seizure
   - Consider Neuro consult
   - Final read head CT: no acute findings on final read
   - Toxic-metabolic as above
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Multifactorial related to ARF with uremia, lactic
   acidosis, acoholic ketoacidosis.  Increased Osm gap to 17, but not
   greater than 25.  Likely related to alcoholic ketoacidosis, lactic
   acidosis and the presence of alcohol can alter the assay.
   -          Good UPO with hydration
   -
   .
   # Alcohol intoxication: Measurable level on admission.
   - Versed as above for sedation
   - Thiamine, folate
   - seizure precautions
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Likely multifactorial etiology relating to
   prerenal status, hypovolemia, possibly ATN and then worsened by
   rhabdomyolysis and myoglobin induced nephropathy.
   - Agressive IVF as above
   - Bicarbonate as above
   - Renal consult
   - UA, lytes
   - Urine pH
   .
   #  Transaminitis: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to initial toxic insult, ischemia,
   alcohol intoxication or viral etiology.
   - Trend
   - IVF as above
   - Consider further work-up with viral etiology should it worsen
   - RUQ u/s
   .
   # Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 8**] be due to infection (PNA, biliary), aspiration
   pneumonitis or seizures. Blood cultures pending, UA at OSH negative.
   Given Levofloxacin / Zosyn in ED, which is correct empiric therapy for
   CAP requiring ICU admission.
   - Continue Levo 250mg IV (renally dosed)
   - Zosyn IV
   - Follow-up blood cultures / UCx
   - CXR in AM
   - RUQ u/s with doppler
   - EEG

   # Coffee ground emesis: Concern for this upon admission to OSH.  Guaiac
   negative here.
   - Serial Hct
   - CVL
   - T&C
   - Transfuse < 30
   .
   # Central Arterial line: Left subclavian line in artery.  Vascular
   consulted, to leave in place and pull in OR once more clinically
   stable.
   - Per vascular, leave in place

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male who was found down with a history of alcohol intoxication, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and profound acidosis. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 102.2°F (39°C)
* Heart rate: 80 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 139/65 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.4-7.6 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.9-11.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 245-183 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 4.1-4.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.19-0.43 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.7 g/dL
* Calcium: 6.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.9 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Vancomycin
* Piperacillin/Tazobactam
* Gentamicin
* Midazolam
* Dextrose 50%
* Thiamine
* Folate

The patient's plan includes:

* Respiratory support with mechanical ventilation
* Aggressive hydration and electrolyte replacement
* Monitoring of serum potassium, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine levels
* Weaning of ventilator as tolerated
* EEG to rule out occult seizure
* Consideration of neurology consult
* Renal consult
* Urine analysis and culture
* Serial monitoring of liver function tests
* Consideration of further work-up for viral etiology of transaminitis

Potential medical complications that could arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Sepsis or septic shock due to bacterial infection
* Acute kidney injury or failure due to rhabdomyolysis, hypovolemia, or ATN
* Electrolyte imbalances due to fluid and electrolyte shifts
* Liver dysfunction or failure due to toxic insult, ischemia, or viral etiology
* Leukocytosis or neutrophilia due to infection or inflammation
* Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)
* Venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to prolonged immobilization
* Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to corticosteroid use or stress

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo M found down, with alcohol intoxication, rhabdomyolysis, acute
   renal failure and profound acidosis
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis.  Initially thought due to infection (PNA,
   biliary), aspiration pneumonitis or seizures. Blood cultures pending,
   UA at OSH negative.  Given Levofloxacin / Zosyn in ED, which is correct
   empiric therapy for CAP requiring ICU admission.  Continued  on Levo
   250mg IV (renally dosed) & Zosyn IV.
   - Blood cx: GNR, GPC
   - Sputum cx: GPC
   - Levaquin d/c'd
   - Follow-up blood cultures / UCx
   - CXR in AM
   - Confirm final read CT abdomen, ?biliary tract involvement
   - Current antibiotics include: Vancomycin, Zosyn, Gentamicin,
   Metronidazole
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to obtunded mental status, also with
   concern for PNA on chest x-ray.  Unknown past tobacco use or prior
   pulmonary history.
   - GPC in sputum, on vanco
   - Wean vent as tolerated, will hold until pulling of subclavian A-line
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated CK [**Numeric Identifier 5119**] and found down.  Not reportedly on
   statin or other medication that would worsen this.  Thus, likely
   etiology, being found down, is now resolved.  No e/o viral infection or
   autoimmune myopathy at this point.
   - Aggressive hydration with NS/LR
   - Monitoring serial measurements of serum potassium, calcium,
   phosphate, and creatinine
   - CK trending down
   # AMS: Found down, initial GCS =3.  Previous AMS s/p seizures and had
   subtherapeutic phenytoin.  No e/o seizure but cannot rule-out NCSE.
   Also with continued alcohol withdrawal, metabolic abnormalities, and
   likely occult infection.
   - Versed for sedation, should treat possible DTs as well
   - Final read head CT: no acute findings on final read
   - Toxic-metabolic as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Multifactorial related to ARF with uremia, lactic
   acidosis, acoholic ketoacidosis.  Increased Osm gap to 17, but not
   greater than 25.  Likely related to alcoholic ketoacidosis, lactic
   acidosis and the presence of alcohol can alter the assay.  Anion gap
   has closed.
   - Good UPO with hydration
   # Alcohol intoxication: Measurable level on admission.
   - Versed as above for sedation
   - Thiamine, folate
   - seizure precautions
   # Acute renal failure: Likely multifactorial etiology relating to
   prerenal status, hypovolemia, possibly ATN and then worsened by
   rhabdomyolysis and myoglobin induced nephropathy.
   - Agressive IVF as above
   - Bicarbonate as above
   - Renal consult appreciated
   #  Transaminitis: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to initial toxic insult, ischemia,
   alcohol intoxication or viral etiology.  But AST elevated most
   prominently so could all be [**12-18**] muscle breakdown from rhabdomyolysis.
   - IVF as above
   - Consider further work-up with viral etiology should it worsen
   # Coffee ground emesis: Concern for this upon admission to OSH.  Guaiac
   negative here.
   - Serial Hct
   - CVL
   - T&C
   # Central Arterial line: Left subclavian line in artery.  Vascular
   consulted, to leave in place and pull in OR once more clinically
   stable.
   - Per vascular, plan to pull today
   # Pancolitis: Seen on CT scan.  Likely [**12-18**] C.diff for other enteric
   pathogen.  No known exposure to antibiotics.
   - Flagyl / Zosyn
   - Add on po Vanco
   FEN: Euvolemic / electrolyte abnormalities as above, hypernatremia
   today will increase free water / NPO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to obtunded mental status, also with
   concern for PNA on chest x-ray.  Unknown past tobacco use or prior
   pulmonary history.
   - GPC in sputum, on vanco
   - Wean vent as tolerated, will hold until pulling of subclavian A-line
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated CK [**Numeric Identifier 5119**] and found down.  Not reportedly on
   statin or other medication that would worsen this.  Thus, likely
   etiology, being found down, is now resolved.  No e/o viral infection or
   autoimmune myopathy at this point.
   - Aggressive hydration with NS/LR
   - Monitoring serial measurements of serum potassium, calcium,
   phosphate, and creatinine
   - CK trending down
   # AMS: Found down, initial GCS =3.  Previous AMS s/p seizures and had
   subtherapeutic phenytoin.  No e/o seizure but cannot rule-out NCSE.
   Also with continued alcohol withdrawal, metabolic abnormalities, and
   likely occult infection.
   - Versed for sedation, should treat possible DTs as well
   - Final read head CT: no acute findings on final read
   - Toxic-metabolic as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Multifactorial related to ARF with uremia, lactic
   acidosis, acoholic ketoacidosis.  Increased Osm gap to 17, but not
   greater than 25.  Likely related to alcoholic ketoacidosis, lactic
   acidosis and the presence of alcohol can alter the assay.  Anion gap
   has closed.
   - Good UPO with hydration
   # Alcohol intoxication: Measurable level on admission.
   - Versed as above for sedation
   - Thiamine, folate
   - seizure precautions
   # Acute renal failure: Likely multifactorial etiology relating to
   prerenal status, hypovolemia, possibly ATN and then worsened by
   rhabdomyolysis and myoglobin induced nephropathy.
   - Agressive IVF as above
   - Bicarbonate as above
   - Renal consult appreciated
   #  Transaminitis: [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to initial toxic insult, ischemia,
   alcohol intoxication or viral etiology.  But AST elevated most
   prominently so could all be [**12-18**] muscle breakdown from rhabdomyolysis.
   - IVF as above
   - Consider further work-up with viral etiology should it worsen
   # Coffee ground emesis: Concern for this upon admission to OSH.  Guaiac
   negative here.
   - Serial Hct
   - CVL
   - T&C
   # Central Arterial line: Left subclavian line in artery.  Vascular
   consulted, to leave in place and pull in OR once more clinically
   stable.
   - Per vascular, plan to pull today
   # Pancolitis: Seen on CT scan.  Likely [**12-18**] C.diff for other enteric
   pathogen.  No known exposure to antibiotics.
   - Flagyl / Zosyn
   - Add on po Vanco
   FEN: Euvolemic / electrolyte abnormalities as above, hypernatremia

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU with shock, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. The patient has a complex medical condition with multiple potential complications.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a diagnosis of pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The ABG results show a pH of 7.46, which is within normal limits, but the patient's respiratory status is still concerning.

The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, with a diagnosis of sepsis and potential cardiac tamponade. The patient's troponin level is elevated at 0.19 ng/mL, which suggests cardiac injury. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm, but the patient's cardiac status is still concerning.

The patient's neurological status is also concerning, with a diagnosis of acute metabolic encephalopathy. The patient's GCS is 3, which suggests a severe neurological injury. The patient's sedation level is 54-96, which suggests that the patient is still in a coma.

The patient's metabolic status is also concerning, with a diagnosis of metabolic acidosis. The patient's anion gap is elevated at 17, which suggests a metabolic acidosis. The patient's potassium level is elevated at 4.1 mmol/L, which suggests a potential risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's infectious disease status is also concerning, with a diagnosis of pneumonia and sepsis. The patient's blood cultures are pending, but the patient's sputum culture shows growth of GPC. The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics, including vancomycin, Zosyn, and gentamicin.

The patient's renal status is also concerning, with a diagnosis of acute renal failure. The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 4.1 mg/dL, which suggests a severe renal injury. The patient is receiving aggressive IVF and bicarbonate therapy to manage the patient's renal failure.

The patient's gastrointestinal status is also concerning, with a diagnosis of pancolitis. The patient's CT scan shows evidence of pancolitis, which suggests a potential risk of C. diff infection. The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics, including flagyl and Zosyn.

The patient's overall condition is critical, with multiple potential complications. The patient requires close monitoring and aggressive management to manage the patient's respiratory, cardiac, neurological, and metabolic status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition, including sepsis, severe, with organ dysfunction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, and metabolic acidosis. They are intubated for airway protection and have a history of ethanol intoxication, which may increase their risk of developing delirium tremens. The patient has undergone several interventions, including the placement of an arterial line, a multi-lumen catheter, and the administration of various medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is suspected to be caused by pancolitis, possibly caused by Clostridioides difficile (C. diff). The patient is receiving antibiotics, but the infection may not be fully controlled, leading to further complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection, but there is a risk of developing respiratory failure due to their underlying condition.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's rhabdomyolysis is being managed with good urine output, but there is a risk of further muscle damage and complications.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia has been controlled, but there is a risk of developing hypoglycemia if the insulin drip is not properly managed.
5. Ethanol Intoxication: The patient's ethanol intoxication may increase their risk of developing delirium tremens, which can be a life-threatening complication.
6. SCL Removal: The patient is scheduled to have their SCL removed in the cath lab today, which may be a high-risk procedure.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is a significant complication, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not properly managed.
8. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is a complication of their underlying condition and may worsen if not properly managed.

These potential medical complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's condition to prevent further complications and ensure the best possible outcomes."

   I have seen and examined the patient with the resident and agree with
   the assessment and plan as above with the following
   emphasis/modifications:
   67 year old male history of alcohol abuse and bipolar disorder who
   presents after being found down for unknown period of time.  Had GCS of
   3 and was intubated and brought to outside hospital.   HCT/neck CT
   negative and transferred to [**Hospital1 5**].
   Yesterday, found to have both gram negatives and gram positives in
   blood.  Was hypotensive and elevated lactate but overnight was
   aggressively resuscitated and doing better.

   2) Surgery consulted following for colitis and gluteal muscle swelling
   (? Myositis)
   3) Remove right subclavian malpositioned line in cath lab per vascular
   4) Resuscitation as dictated by perfusion endpoints
   5) Continue mechanical ventilation at current settings

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and bipolar disorder, who presents with septic shock, polymicrobial blood cultures, and diffuse colitis. He was found down for an unknown period, was intubated, and transferred to the ICU. The patient has been aggressively resuscitated and is currently stable, but with ongoing respiratory and cardiovascular instability.

Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has suspected sepsis due to polymicrobial blood cultures, and the source is likely translocation from the gut as he has diffuse colitis.
2. Colitis: The patient has diffuse colitis, which is likely causing the sepsis. Surgery is planned to follow.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to sepsis and colitis.
4. Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which is likely secondary to sepsis, colitis, and rhabdomyolysis.
5. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has rhabdomyolysis, which is likely secondary to sepsis and colitis.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely secondary to sepsis, colitis, and rhabdomyolysis.
7. Alcohol Abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, which may be contributing to his current condition.
8. Malpositioned Line: The patient has a malpositioned line in the subclavian artery, which needs to be removed.

Plan:

1. Continue Zosyn/gent/vancomycin antibiotics.
2. Consult surgery for colitis and gluteal muscle swelling (myositis).
3. Remove the malpositioned line in the cath lab.
4. Continue mechanical ventilation at current settings.
5. Resuscitate the patient as dictated by perfusion endpoints.
6. Monitor for signs of sepsis, colitis, and rhabdomyolysis.
7. Consider further interventions, such as vasopressors and dialysis, as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 80 kg male who has been admitted to the ICU with septic shock, rhabdo, and renal failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Heart rate: 85 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 147/70 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 99%
* CVP: 7 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 8.6 g/dL
* Creatinine: 3.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 27 mEq/L
* Serum potassium: 4.3 mEq/L
* Serum sodium: 145 mEq/L
* Glucose: 85 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Albumin: 1.7 g/dL
* LDH: 848 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.7 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 5.3 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include septic shock, rhabdo, renal failure, hyperglycemia, acidosis, and respiratory failure. The patient is at risk for developing electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, due to his fluid and electrolyte disorders.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of septic shock and organ dysfunction
2. Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
3. Progression of rhabdo to multi-organ failure
4. Renal failure requiring dialysis
5. Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia
6. Hyperglycemia leading to diabetic ketoacidosis
7. Acidosis leading to metabolic encephalopathy
8. Respiratory failure requiring tracheostomy
9. Development of nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)

The patient's current treatment plan includes antibiotics, fluids, and electrolyte replacement. The patient's arterial line was stopped, and a multi-lumen line was inserted. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, and his respiratory support is being closely monitored. The patient's glycemic control is being managed with insulin therapy, and his electrolyte levels are being monitored regularly."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 yo M found down, with alcohol intoxication, rhabdomyolysis, acute
   renal failure and profound acidosis
   # Sepsis: Source likely intra-abd (colitis on scan) vs PNA.
   - Blood cx: GNR, GPC
   - Sputum cx: GPC
   - Follow-up blood cultures / UCx
   - CXR in AM
   - Confirm final read CT abdomen, ?biliary tract involvement
   - Current antibiotics include: Vancomycin, Zosyn, Gentamicin,
   Metronidazole
   # Respiratory Failure: Secondary to obtunded mental status, also with
   concern for PNA on chest x-ray.  Unknown past tobacco use or prior
   pulmonary history.
   - GPC in sputum, on vanco
   - Wean vent as tolerated, possible extubation today
   # Rhabdomyolysis: Elevated CK and found down.  Not reportedly on statin
   or other medication that would worsen this.  Thus, likely etiology,
   being found down, is now resolved.  No e/o viral infection or
   autoimmune myopathy at this point.
   - Aggressive hydration with NS/LR
   - Monitoring serial measurements of serum potassium, calcium,
   phosphate, and creatinine
   - CK trending down
   # AMS: Found down, initial GCS =3.  Previous AMS s/p seizures and had
   subtherapeutic phenytoin.  No e/o seizure but cannot rule-out NCSE.
   Also with continued alcohol withdrawal, metabolic abnormalities, and
   likely occult infection.
   - Versed for sedation, should treat possible DTs as well
   - Final read head CT: no acute findings on final read
   - Toxic-metabolic as above
   # Metabolic acidosis: Multifactorial related to ARF with uremia, lactic
   acidosis, acoholic ketoacidosis.  Gap closed.  Likely related to
   alcoholic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis and the presence of alcohol can
   alter the assay.
   - Good UPO with hydration
   # Alcohol intoxication: Measurable level on admission.
   - Versed as above for sedation
   - Thiamine, folate
   - seizure precautions
   # Hx Sz disorder: Restarted anti-sz meds now that off versed.
   - Sz meds
   - Monitor for sz activity

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 67-year-old male who was found down with alcohol intoxication, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and profound acidosis. He was intubated and admitted to the ICU. The patient has undergone several interventions, including removal of a central line, placement of a stent, and administration of antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other medications.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, and blood pressure of 147/70 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation. His respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating rhabdomyolysis. His renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 3.9 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 27 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia.

The patient's medical history is significant for seizures, and he has been restarted on anticonvulsant medication. He has also been treated for possible delirium tremens (DTs) and alcohol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's source of infection is likely intra-abdominal or pneumonia, and he is at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he is at risk for developing respiratory failure due to his underlying condition.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's rhabdomyolysis is likely related to his alcohol intoxication and hypovolemia, and he is at risk for developing further muscle damage.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely multifactorial, and he is at risk for developing chronic kidney disease.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely related to his rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, and he is at risk for developing further acidosis.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and he is at risk for developing further electrolyte imbalances.
7. Seizures: The patient's history of seizures and his current condition make him at risk for developing further seizures.
8. Delirium Tremens: The patient's history of DTs and his current condition make him at risk for developing further DTs.
9. Pancreatitis: The patient's elevated levels of amylase and lipase suggest pancreatitis, and he is at risk for developing further pancreatic damage.
10. Intra-abdominal Infection: The patient's intra-abdominal infection is likely related to his colitis, and he is at risk for developing further intra-abdominal complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* Septic shock with rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure
* Profound acidosis
* Intra-abdominal sepsis with suspected source from colitis or pneumonia
* Respiratory failure with concern for pneumonia
* Rhabdomyolysis with elevated CK levels
* Altered mental status with concern for possible non-convulsive status epilepticus
* Metabolic acidosis with multifactorial etiology
* Thrombocytopenia with possible etiologies including heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and cirrhosis
* Transaminitis with possible etiologies including toxic insult, ischemia, alcohol intoxication, and viral etiology
* Pancolitis with concern for Clostridioides difficile infection

**Potential Complications:**

* Continued septic shock with potential for organ failure
* Pneumonia with potential for respiratory failure and death
* Rhabdomyolysis with potential for further muscle damage and kidney injury
* Non-convulsive status epilepticus with potential for seizure activity and brain damage
* Metabolic acidosis with potential for further deterioration and organ failure
* Thrombocytopenia with potential for bleeding complications
* Transaminitis with potential for further liver damage and encephalopathy
* Pancolitis with potential for further intestinal damage and sepsis

**Assessment and Plan:**

* Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy for suspected intra-abdominal sepsis
* Wean ventilator as tolerated and consider extubation
* Aggressively hydrate with normal saline and lactated Ringer's solution
* Monitor serial measurements of serum potassium, calcium, phosphate, and creatinine
* Restart anti-seizure medications and continue sedation with midazolam
* Consider further work-up for viral etiology of transaminitis
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and organ failure
* Continue renal consult and consider further interventions for acute renal failure
* Monitor for bleeding complications and consider platelet transfusion
* Consider further interventions for pancolitis, including surgery and antibiotics."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patient has undergone various medical interventions, including catheterization, stent placement, and antibiotic administration. The patient's condition is characterized by:

1. Sepsis, severe, with organ dysfunction, suspected to be caused by GBS PNA, colitis, GNR bacteremia, and CNS bacteremia.
2. Respiratory failure, acute, with improved oxygenation and ability to follow commands, but still requiring mechanical ventilation.
3. Rhabdomyolysis, improving, but requiring close monitoring of urine output.
4. Ethanol abuse, with potential withdrawal symptoms.
5. Seizure disorder, requiring continued anticonvulsant therapy.
6. Acute renal failure, with unclear cause, possibly related to sepsis or ATN.
7. Thrombocytopenia, unlikely related to sepsis, with unclear cause.
8. Arterial line complications, including extravasation and potential hematoma.
9. Colitis, suspected to be caused by C. Diff, with ongoing antibiotic therapy.
10. FEN (Fentanyl) administration, with plans for extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis progression, leading to organ dysfunction and potential mortality.
2. Respiratory failure, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Rhabdomyolysis, potentially leading to acute kidney injury and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Ethanol withdrawal, potentially leading to seizures, delirium, and cardiovascular instability.
5. Seizure disorder, potentially leading to status epilepticus and brain damage.
6. Acute renal failure, potentially leading to chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular morbidity.
7. Thrombocytopenia, potentially leading to bleeding complications and hemorrhage.
8. Arterial line complications, potentially leading to bleeding, hematoma, or limb ischemia.
9. Colitis, potentially leading to sepsis, perforation, and mortality.
10. FEN withdrawal, potentially leading to withdrawal symptoms, including agitation, anxiety, and respiratory depression."

   ------ Protected Section ------
   I have seen and examined the patient with the resident and agree with
   the assessment and plan as above with the following
   emphasis/modifications:
   67 year old male history of alcohol abuse and bipolar disorder who
   presents after being found down for unknown period of time.  Had GCS of
   3 and was intubated and brought to outside hospital.   HCT/neck CT
   negative and transferred to [**Hospital1 5**].
   Yesterday, found to have both gram negatives and gram positives in
   blood.  Was hypotensive and on pressors but now resuscitated and
   improved with good urine output and lactate cleared.  However, mental
   status this morning slightly depressed as just coming off versed today.
   PE T 36.1  P 94  BP 112/70 RR  18   Sat 98%
   Lactate 1.4
   - CT scan with colitis, enlarged gluteal muscle
   Urine output 30-50 cc/hour
   1) Septic Shock
 polymicrobial (gram negatives, gram positives in
   blood
staph coag negative)
 source likely translocation from gut as
   patient has diffuse colitis and staph may be from line although will
   discuss with surgery if could be from gluteal muscles
   2) Colitis
 surgery following
   3) Respiratory Failure
   4) Acidosis
   5) Rhabdomyolysis
   6) Acute Renal Failure
   7) Alcohol Abuse
   8) Malpositioned line in subclavian artery
   Plan:
   1) Continue Zosyn/vancomycin/flagyl
   2) Surgery following for colitis and gluteal muscle swelling (?
   Myositis)
   3) Remove right subclavian malpositioned line in cath lab per vascular
   4) Will plan extubation when mental status improves
 likely secondary
   to sedation

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   I have seen and examined the patient with the resident and agree with
   the assessment and plan as above with the following
   emphasis/modifications:
   67 year old male history of alcohol abuse and bipolar disorder who
   presents after being found down for unknown period of time.  Had GCS of
   3 and was intubated and brought to outside hospital.   HCT/neck CT
   negative and transferred to [**Hospital1 5**].
   Yesterday, found to have both gram negatives and gram positives in
   blood.  Was hypotensive and on pressors but now resuscitated and
   improved with good urine output and lactate cleared.  However, mental
   status this morning slightly depressed as just coming off versed today.
   PE T 36.1  P 94  BP 112/70 RR  18   Sat 98%

   1) Septic Shock
 polymicrobial (gram negatives, gram positives in
   blood
staph coag negative)
 source likely translocation from gut as
   patient has diffuse colitis and staph may be from line although will
   discuss with surgery if could be from gluteal muscles
   2) Colitis

   4) Acidosis
   5) Rhabdomyolysis
   6) Acute Renal Failure
   7) Alcohol Abuse
   8) Malpositioned line in subclavian artery
   Plan:
   1) Continue Zosyn/vancomycin/flagyl
   2) Surgery following for colitis and gluteal muscle swelling (?
   Myositis)
   3) Remove right subclavian malpositioned line in cath lab per vascular
   4) Will plan extubation when mental status improves
 likely secondary
   to sedation

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and bipolar disorder who presents after being found down for an unknown period. He was intubated and brought to the outside hospital, where he was found to have both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in his blood. He was hypotensive and on pressors, but has since been resuscitated and is improving with good urine output and lactate clearance.

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient has polymicrobial sepsis, likely caused by translocation from the gut, with a source of infection likely from the colitis or gluteal muscle swelling.
2. Colitis: The patient has diffuse colitis, which is likely contributing to the sepsis.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is improving with CPAP/PSV ventilation.
4. Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, likely caused by the sepsis and colitis.
5. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has rhabdomyolysis, which is improving with good urine output.
6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely caused by the sepsis and ATN.
7. Alcohol Abuse: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, which may be contributing to his current condition.
8. Malpositioned line: The patient has a malpositioned line in the subclavian artery, which needs to be removed.

The plan for the patient includes:

1. Continuing antibiotics (Zosyn, vancomycin, and flagyl) to treat the sepsis.
2. Surgery to repair the colitis and gluteal muscle swelling.
3. Removing the malpositioned line in the cath lab.
4. Planning for extubation when the patient's mental status improves, likely secondary to sedation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Further deterioration of the patient's respiratory status, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Development of multi-organ failure, including kidney, liver, and cardiac failure.
3. Worsening of the patient's acidosis, leading to further metabolic derangements.
4. Progression of the patient's rhabdomyolysis, leading to further kidney damage.
5. Complications from the surgery, including bleeding, infection, and organ damage.
6. Withdrawal from alcohol, leading to seizures, tremors, and other withdrawal symptoms.
7. Development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility.
8. Infection at the site of the malpositioned line, leading to further sepsis."
