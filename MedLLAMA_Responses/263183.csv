   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay
   - check TTE for assessment of underlying function
   - BNP > 70,000
   - Check cardiac enzymes
   - Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr
   - change labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and change diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - attempt to obtain sputum culture
   - chest PT
   - followup pending micro data
   - consider checking C Diff toxin if develops diarrhea
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hypernatremia: lkikely from poor free water intake and ongoing
   fevers
   - incresae free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   - add glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   .
   ## Hypertension: goal SBP<160 given head bleed
   - cont lisinopril, valsartan as above; change diltiazem and beta
   blocker as above
   - d/c terazosin as above
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - change rate control agents as above
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman who underwent a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course is complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. She is currently receiving furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr, empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia, and other medications to manage her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's multifactorial respiratory failure is likely due to pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF and aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. Close monitoring of her respiratory status is essential, and interventions such as non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or intubation may be necessary.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR is poorly controlled, and her cardiac enzymes are elevated. Further evaluation with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is recommended to assess underlying cardiac function. The patient's high BNP level (>70,000) suggests cardiac dysfunction, and her cardiac enzymes should be closely monitored.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fevers, likely due to aspiration pneumonia, may progress to sepsis. Close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical status is essential to detect early signs of sepsis.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to poor free water intake and ongoing fevers. Increasing free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h may help correct this electrolyte imbalance.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may be due to acute illness or baseline glucose intolerance. Tight glycemic control with sliding scale insulin and addition of glargine 6 units qhs may help manage this condition.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is a concern given her recent head bleed. Close monitoring of her blood pressure and adjustments to her antihypertensive medications may be necessary to maintain a goal SBP <160.
7. Subdural Hematoma: The patient's subdural hematoma is a concern, and close monitoring of her neurologic status and imaging studies is essential to detect any changes or complications.
8. Infections: The patient's hospital-acquired pneumonia and fevers may lead to other infections, such as urinary tract infections or central line-associated bloodstream infections. Close monitoring of her laboratory values and clinical status is essential to detect early signs of infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay
   - check TTE for assessment of underlying function
   - BNP > 70,000
   - Check cardiac enzymes
   - Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr
   - change labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and change diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - attempt to obtain sputum culture
   - chest PT
   - followup pending micro data
   - consider checking C Diff toxin if develops diarrhea
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hypernatremia: lkikely from poor free water intake and ongoing
   fevers
   - incresae free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   - add glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   .
   ## Hypertension: goal SBP<160 given head bleed
   - cont lisinopril, valsartan as above; change diltiazem and beta
   blocker as above
   - d/c terazosin as above
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - change rate control agents as above
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old woman, is currently in the ICU following a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course is complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and fevers likely due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. She has a history of hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hypernatremia. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 100.8°F, blood pressure of 141/61 mmHg, and heart rate in the 70s.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF and likely aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
2. Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures negative to date.
3. Hypernatremia: likely from poor free water intake and ongoing fevers.
4. Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance or if it's from acute illness.
5. Hypertension: goal SBP <160 given head bleed.
6. Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due in part to ongoing infectious process.
7. Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow NSurg recs.

Recommendations:

1. Check TTE for assessment of underlying cardiac function.
2. Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr.
3. Change labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and diltiazem XR to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis.
4. Empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia.
5. Attempt to obtain sputum culture.
6. Chest PT.
7. Follow-up pending micro data.
8. Consider checking C Diff toxin if develops diarrhea.
9. If fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam.
10. Increase free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h.
11. Add glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale.
12. Cont lisinopril, valsartan as above; change diltiazem and beta blocker as above.
13. D/C terazosin as above.
14. Cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial bleed.
15. Follow NSurg recs for subdural hematoma.
16. SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
17. H2-blocker for stress ulcer prophylaxis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay
   - check TTE for assessment of underlying function
   - BNP > 70,000
   - Check cardiac enzymes
   - Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr
   - change labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and change diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - attempt to obtain sputum culture
   - chest PT
   - followup pending micro data
   - consider checking C Diff toxin if develops diarrhea
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hypernatremia: lkikely from poor free water intake and ongoing
   fevers
   - incresae free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   - add glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   .
   ## Hypertension: goal SBP<160 given head bleed
   - cont lisinopril, valsartan as above; change diltiazem and beta
   blocker as above
   - d/c terazosin as above
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - change rate control agents as above
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old woman, is in the ICU with a complex medical condition following a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. She has decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, and rate control agents. She has hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension, and is at risk for respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and acute-on-chronic CHF.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is precarious, and she is at risk for further deterioration due to pulmonary edema and acute-on-chronic CHF.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fevers are likely due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia, and she is at risk for developing sepsis if not properly managed.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is likely due to poor free water intake and ongoing fevers, and if not managed, can lead to further electrolyte imbalances and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is unclear in origin, but if not properly managed, can lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is a concern given her recent head bleed, and if not properly managed, can lead to further bleeding or other complications.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is poorly controlled, and if not properly managed, can lead to further complications such as stroke or heart failure.
7. Subdural hematoma: The patient's subdural hematoma is a concern, and if not properly managed, can lead to further bleeding or other complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   Imaging: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular
   systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular
   septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay
   - check TTE for assessment of underlying function
   - BNP > 70,000
   - Check cardiac enzymes
   - Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr
   - change labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and change diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - attempt to obtain sputum culture
   - chest PT
   - followup pending micro data
   - consider checking C Diff toxin if develops diarrhea
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hypernatremia: lkikely from poor free water intake and ongoing
   fevers
   - incresae free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   - add glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   .
   ## Hypertension: goal SBP<160 given head bleed
   - cont lisinopril, valsartan as above; change diltiazem and beta
   blocker as above
   - d/c terazosin as above
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - change rate control agents as above
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an 87-year-old woman, is currently in the ICU following a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course is complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 5 liters of oxygen. Her respiratory support includes a non-invasive ventilator with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's lab results show evidence of cardiac dysfunction, with a troponin-T level of 0.06 ng/mL and a BNP level of >70,000 pg/mL. Her cardiac enzymes are elevated, with a CK level of 71 U/L and a CK-MB level of 5 U/L. Her liver function tests are also abnormal, with an AST level of 34 U/L and an ALT level of 31 U/L.

The patient's imaging studies show evidence of cardiac dysfunction, with an elongated left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, and hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. Her tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure, and her transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.

Based on the patient's condition, the plan is to:

* Continue to monitor her vital signs and cardiac function closely
* Administer furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr to aid in diuresis
* Change labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and diltiazem XR to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control
* Administer empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia
* Check cultures and random vanco level
* Continue to monitor her respiratory status and adjust her respiratory support as needed
* Monitor her liver function tests and adjust her medications accordingly
* Continue to monitor her cardiac enzymes and adjust her medications accordingly

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF and aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation
* Infection due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia
* Hyperglycemia due to poor glucose control
* Hypertension due to poor blood pressure control
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Increased risk of seizures due to phenytoin therapy
* Increased risk of DVT due to immobility and anticoagulation therapy
* Increased risk of stress ulcer due to anticoagulation therapy and poor nutrition."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay
   - check TTE for assessment of underlying function
   - BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes NL
   - Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr
   - changed labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and changed diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction

   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - chest PT
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hypernatremia: lkikely from poor free water intake and ongoing
   fevers
   -          incresae free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h
   -          not resolved
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or

   insulin
   -          add glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   -          Now stable

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old woman, is a post-operative patient who underwent a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. She has developed decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and fevers likely due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient is receiving furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr, and empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia. She is also receiving medications for hypertension, hyperglycemia, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, likely due to pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF, and aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. This can lead to further decline in lung function and increased risk of respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR and decompensated CHF increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient's fevers and positive cultures for hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia increase her risk of developing sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia, likely due to poor free water intake and ongoing fevers, can lead to further electrolyte imbalance and potential neurological complications.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia, likely due to acute illness or glucose intolerance, can lead to further complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension, likely due to CHF and medication, can lead to further complications, such as cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and cerebrovascular events.
7. Subdural hematoma: The patient's subdural hematoma can lead to further complications, such as increased intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, and potential neurological deficits.
8. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's risk of venous thromboembolism, likely due to immobility and CHF, can lead to further complications, such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, an 87-year-old woman, is currently in the ICU following a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course has been complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and fevers likely due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 97.5°F (36.4°C)
* Blood pressure: 148/60 mmHg
* Pulse: 76 irregular
* Respiratory rate: 17 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 97% on 70% FiO2

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 27.6%
* Platelet count: 286 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 10.7 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 120 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 140 mEq/L, potassium 3.3 mEq/L, magnesium 1.8 mg/dL, phosphorus 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.06 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.3 g/dL
* LDH: 297 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Left atrium is elongated
* Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy
* Normal left ventricular cavity size
* Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal
* Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%)
* Increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg)
* Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction

The patient's plan includes:

* Respiratory failure management: net positive 5 L for length of stay
* Cardiac management: furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr, changed labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and changed diltiazem XR to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
* Fevers management: empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco level
* Hypernatremia management: increase free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h
* Hyperglycemia management: add glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
* Atrial fibrillation management: change rate control agents as above, continue to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial bleed
* Subdural hematoma management: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow NSurg recs

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF and aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia
* Cardiac complications due to decompensated CHF and atrial fibrillation
* Infection due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia
* Hypernatremia due to poor free water intake and ongoing fevers
* Hyperglycemia due to acute illness or baseline glucose intolerance
* Atrial fibrillation due to ongoing infectious process
* Subdural hematoma complications due to bleeding or infection
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and central venous catheters
* Stress ulcer due to critical illness and medications
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation"

   Imaging: The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular
   systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Tissue Doppler imaging
   suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg).
   Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with
   Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. There is no ventricular
   septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
   stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a history of diastolic failure and hypertension. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 180/90 mmHg. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a positive fluid balance, with a total input of 0 mL and a total output of 0 mL over the past 24 hours.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate levels. The patient's troponin-T levels are normal, but the cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, and Troponin-T) are elevated. The patient's liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and Alk Phos) are also elevated.

The patient's imaging studies show mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, normal left ventricular cavity size, and hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function. The patient's left ventricular diastolic function is impaired, with a transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction.

The patient's plan of care includes ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and stress ulcer prevention.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Prolonged QT interval due to elevated potassium levels
	* Tachycardia or bradycardia due to changes in blood pressure
	* Cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
	* Respiratory failure due to impaired lung function
3. Renal complications:
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension or electrolyte imbalances
	* Chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to prolonged ICU stay
4. Neurological complications:
	* Seizures or status epilepticus due to electrolyte imbalances or medication
	* Cerebral edema or herniation due to increased intracranial pressure
5. Infection-related complications:
	* Sepsis or septic shock due to bacterial or fungal infections
	* Organ failure due to systemic inflammation
6. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer or peptic ulcer disease
	* Nutritional deficiencies due to impaired gut function
7. Hematological complications:
	* Thrombocytopenia or bleeding due to platelet dysfunction or sepsis
	* Anemia due to blood loss or impaired erythropoiesis

These potential complications highlight the importance of close monitoring and management of the patient's condition in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay
   - check TTE for assessment of underlying function
   - BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes NL
   - Furosemide drip for net negative 100 cc/hr
   - changed labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and changed diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - chest PT
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hypernatremia: lkikely from poor free water intake and ongoing
   fevers
   -          incresae free H2O boluses with tube feeds to 150 cc q6h
   -          not resolved
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   -          add glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   -          Now stable
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - change rate control agents as above
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer
   ## Access: PIVs
   ## Communication: with daughter/POA [**Name (NI) 536**] [**Name (NI) 4782**] (cell [**0-0-**])
   ## Code: DNR/DNI
   ## Dispo: call out!

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient, an 87-year-old woman, is currently in the ICU following a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course is complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and fevers likely due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Respiratory support: requiring net positive 5 L for length of stay
* Hemodynamic monitoring: fluid balance is 0 mL in and 0 mL out
* Blood pressure: not specified
* Pulse: not specified
* Temperature: not specified

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 15.9-16.2 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 26.2-29.0%
* Platelet count: 166-369 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.7-0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.06 ng/mL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 34-138 mg/dL
* Glucose: 120-179 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary edema/acute-on-chronic CHF and likely aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia
* Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due in part to ongoing infectious process
* Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia
* Hypernatremia: likely from poor free water intake and ongoing fevers
* Hyperglycemia: unclear if this is from acute illness or baseline glucose intolerance
* Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis

The patient is receiving the following treatments:

* Respiratory support: net positive 5 L for length of stay
* Cardiac medications: furosemide drip, metoprolol, and diltiazem
* Antibiotics: vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia
* Pain management: not specified
* Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis and H2-blocker for stress ulcer

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to worsening pulmonary edema and aspiration pneumonia
* Cardiac complications due to atrial fibrillation and decompensated CHF
* Infections due to hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia
* Hyperglycemia and hypernatremia if not properly managed
* Seizures due to subdural hematoma and phenytoin toxicity

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatments as needed to prevent these complications and improve her overall outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay. TTE with diastolic failure
   - BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes NL
   - FWill d/dc lasix drip start IV with goal -100/hr
   - changed labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and changed diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - chest PT
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   -          glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   -          Now stable
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - Increased lopressor to 100mg Q6H for better rate control and
   hopefully better BP control
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer
   ## Access: PIVs
   ## Communication: with daughter/POA [**Name (NI) 536**] [**Name (NI) 4782**] (cell [**0-0-**])

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay. TTE with diastolic failure
   - BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes NL
   - FWill d/dc lasix drip start IV with goal -100/hr
   - changed labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and changed diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   .
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - chest PT
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   .
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   -          glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   -          Now stable
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - Increased lopressor to 100mg Q6H for better rate control and
   hopefully better BP control
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   .
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   .
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer
   ## Access: PIVs
   ## Communication: with daughter/POA [**Name (NI) 536**] [**Name (NI) 4782**] (cell [**0-0-**])
   ## Code: DNR/DNI
   ## Dispo: [**Month (only) 60**] be able to transfer to floor today if UOP good after IV
   lasix off lasix drip

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

The patient, an 87-year-old woman, has been admitted to the ICU after a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course has been complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and fevers likely due to aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 96.4°F
* Heart rate: 68-115 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 130/47 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18-27 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96-100% on face mask

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Staples out with no erythema or discharge
* Irregular heartbeat with dynamic PMI at mid-axillary line
* Cracks at the bases of the lungs
* Soft abdomen with no tenderness or guarding
* Neurological examination shows the patient opens her eyes to name but does not follow commands.

Laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 15.9-16.2 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 26.2-29.0%
* Platelet count: 166-369 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.7-0.9 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.06 ng/mL
* TCO2: 24-25 mmHg
* Glucose: 120-161 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Respiratory failure management with a net positive 5 L of fluid for length of stay
* CHF management with diuretics and vasodilators
* Fever management with empiric antibiotics and consideration of changing phenytoin to levetiracetam if fevers persist
* Hyperglycemia management with sliding scale insulin and consideration of insulin glargine
* Atrial fibrillation management with rate control medications and consideration of anticoagulation
* Subdural hematoma management with phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis
* Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer
* Access management with PIVs
* Communication with the patient's daughter/POA
* Code status: DNR/DNI
* Disposition: To the floor pending UOP on IV lasix

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and acute-on-chronic CHF
* Sepsis due to hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation
* Hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance or inadequate treatment
* Seizures due to subdural hematoma or phenytoin toxicity
* Deep vein thrombosis due to immobility and lack of prophylaxis
* Stress ulcer due to critical illness and lack of prophylaxis
* Infection due to indwelling lines and catheters."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay. TTE with diastolic failure
   - BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes NL
   - FWill d/dc lasix drip start IV with goal -100/hr
   - changed labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and changed diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
   ## Fevers: likely due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures
   negative to date
   - chest PT
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   -          glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   -          Now stable
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - Increased lopressor to 100mg Q6H for better rate control and
   hopefully better BP control
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer
   ## Access: PIVs
   ## Communication: with daughter/POA [**Name (NI) 536**] [**Name (NI) 4782**] (cell [**0-0-**])
   ## Code: DNR/DNI
   ## Dispo: [**Month (only) 60**] be able to transfer to floor today if UOP good after IV
   lasix off lasix drip

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman who underwent a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma. Her post-operative course has been complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. She has been experiencing respiratory failure, which is multifactorial, and has required mechanical ventilation. She has also developed hyperglycemia, which is being managed with sliding scale insulin. Her atrial fibrillation is poorly controlled, and she is at risk for bleeding due to her intracranial bleed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, and there is a risk of further deterioration. The patient may require increased ventilatory support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
2. Sepsis: The patient's fevers and positive blood cultures suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Cardiac failure: The patient's decompensated CHF is a significant concern, and there is a risk of further cardiac deterioration.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia is a significant concern, and there is a risk of further pulmonary deterioration.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is a concern, and there is a risk of further hyperglycemic complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is poorly controlled, and there is a risk of further cardiac deterioration.
7. Bleeding: The patient's intracranial bleed is a significant concern, and there is a risk of further bleeding or hematoma expansion.
8. DVT: The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to her immobility and underlying medical conditions.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for developing stress ulcer due to her underlying medical conditions and the use of corticosteroids.
10. VAP: The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to her mechanical ventilation and the presence of a central line."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 4781**] is an 87 year old woman now s/p left craniotomy for a
   traumatic subdural hematoma whose post-operative course is now
   complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and
   fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia.
   Plan:
   ## Respiratory failure: multifactorial from pulmonary
   edema/acute-on-chronic CHF (?systolic vs diastolic) and likely
   aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia; net positive 5 L for length of
   stay. TTE with diastolic failure. Pt appears clinically and by CXR
   euvolemic.
      A. CHF:
   - BNP > 70,000
   - cardiac enzymes NL
   - Will d/dc lasix drip start IV with goal -500mL/day as patient
   euvolemic currently.
   - changed labetalol to short-acting metoprolol and changed diltiazem XR
   to short-acting diltiazem for better rate control to aid in diuresis
   - d/c alpha-blocker given that this can worsen CHF
   - cont valsartan, lisinopril for afterload reduction
       B. HAP
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
      C. Apnea: Concerned for central cause esp if has re-bleed vs
   hypocapnea.
   - Will check ABG
   -Will check head CT for re-bleed
   ## Fevers and leukocytosis: Low grade only but has rising WBCslikely
   due to aspiration pneumonia; UA and blood cultures negative to date.
   - Will check differential and re-culture today including C.Diff.
   - If WBCs trend up or she has more fevers today will consider starting
   empiric C.Diff treatment.
   - chest PT
   - empiric vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for
   hospital-acquired/aspiration pneumonia; check cultures and random vanco
   level. Plan to D/C on [**2152-10-15**] after 7 days of treatment given negative
   cultures
   - if fevers persist, consider changing phenytoin to levetiracetam
   ## ?Hip fracture:
   - Will get CT hip today to assess.
   ## Hyperglycemia: unclear if she has baseline glucose intolerance, or
   if this is from acute illness; has required significant sliding scale
   insulin
   -          glargine 6 units qhs with q6h sliding scale
   -          Now stable
   ## Atrial fibrillation: rate poorly-controlled, though this may be due
   in part to ongoing infectious process
   - Increased lopressor to 100mg Q6H for better rate control and
   hopefully better BP control. Only has received 3 doses lopressor today
   so will hold off adding another anti-hypertensive (She
s on Norvasc at
   home) until she has reached steady state.
   - cont to hold anticoagulation given her highly-morbid intracranial
   bleed
   ## Subdural hematoma: on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis; follow
   NSurg recs. Will re-dose phenytoin today as has been low for several
   days.
   ## FEN: tube feeds; increase free H2O flushes to 150 cc q6h
   ## Prophylaxis: SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis; H2-blocker for stress
   ulcer
   ## Access: PIVs
   ## Communication: with daughter/POA [**Name (NI) 536**] [**Name (NI) 4782**] (cell [**0-0-**])
   ## Code: DNR/DNI
   ## Dispo: [**Month (only) 60**] be able to transfer to floor today if UOP good after IV
   lasix off lasix drip

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

24 Hour Events:
   -Changed lasix drip to IV bolus but urine output kept falling so
   switched back to gtt.  However, can most likely be transitioned back to
   bolus today.
   -Call out to floor today.
   -Clinically, breathing better.  At one point, pulled off NRB and
   maintained her sats
   -Wt at 61 kg, down from 65.5 on [**10-9**]
   -Net neg 366 in last 24 hrs; prev 24 hrs was net neg __ (? 700 ml)
   -Talked to daughter re [**Name2 (NI) 1008**]
   -S/p fall onto right hip on [**10-6**].  Orig xray was read as neg for
   fracture.  PT was concerned that right hip was deformed.  Large bruise
   of lateral right hip with possible deformity when compared to left
   side.  Follow up CT scan
   -Phenytoin level decr to 4.4 (6.1 recalc for albumin)
   -Nurses noticed periods of apnea o/n. Patient just did not breathe.

Summary:

The patient, an 87-year-old woman, is a post-operative case of a left craniotomy for a traumatic subdural hematoma, complicated by decompensated CHF, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and fevers likely from aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. She has been experiencing respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, and leukocytosis, and has undergone various treatments and medications to manage these conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a slight decrease in blood pressure and heart rate.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, with pulmonary edema, acute-on-chronic CHF, and likely aspiration/hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient may require continued respiratory support and monitoring.
2. CHF: The patient's CHF is decompensated, and she may require further treatment and monitoring to manage her condition.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is poorly controlled, and she may require further treatment and monitoring to manage her condition.
4. Fevers and leukocytosis: The patient's fevers and leukocytosis are likely due to aspiration pneumonia, and she may require further treatment and monitoring to manage her condition.
5. Hip fracture: The patient may have a hip fracture, and a CT scan will be ordered to assess the situation.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is unclear, and she may require further treatment and monitoring to manage her condition.
7. Subdural hematoma: The patient's subdural hematoma is being managed with phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, and she will require further monitoring and treatment as needed.
8. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is at risk for DVT, and she will require continued prophylaxis with SC heparin.
9. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient will require continued stress ulcer prophylaxis with a H2-blocker.
10. Tube feeds: The patient is receiving tube feeds, and her hydration and nutrition will require continued monitoring and management.

Recommendations:

1. Continue respiratory support and monitoring to manage the patient's respiratory failure.
2. Continue treatment and monitoring to manage the patient's CHF.
3. Continue treatment and monitoring to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation.
4. Continue treatment and monitoring to manage the patient's fevers and leukocytosis.
5. Order a CT scan to assess the patient's hip fracture.
6. Continue treatment and monitoring to manage the patient's hyperglycemia.
7. Continue seizure prophylaxis with phenytoin and monitor the patient's subdural hematoma.
8. Continue DVT prophylaxis with SC heparin.
9. Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis with a H2-blocker.
10. Continue tube feeds and monitor the patient's hydration and nutrition."
