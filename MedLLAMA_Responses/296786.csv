   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  He
   presents with a 3 week history of progressive dyspnea as well as two
   syncopal episodes during this admission.  He was found to have an
   aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3 today on cardiac
   catheterization.  CT Surgery is involved, and the patient is being
   worked up for AVR, likely early next week
    - F/U read on pre-op Carotid U/S
    - F/U CT Surgery recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology regarding clearance prior to surgery. Appreciate
   ID clearance.
    - Gentle diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure
    - Consider adding Dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension
    - Continue to hold home dose of Lisinopril
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had persistently elevated LFTs on
   this admission.  Hepatitis serologies were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM Ab were
   negative, and tox screen was negative.  EBV, CMV, and HSV are currently
   pending.  Hepatology is involved in the patient's care.  DDx includes
   shock liver [**1-24**] poor forward flow v. hepatic congestion [**1-24**] congestive
   heart failure v. medication effect in the setting of HAART v. EtOH
   abuse.
    - F/U Hepatology recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology prior to surgery regarding medical clearance
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  He had
   a cardiac cath yesterday which showed clean coronaries and no evidence
   of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - cont Lasix gtt with goal -1 to 2L today
   - monitor Cr, stop diuresis once Cr bumps
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na this morning was 130, which is
   increased from 127 on [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward
   renal flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis for goal -1L today.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
    - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # ANTICOAG.- Vit K now for INR 1.6
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  He
   presents with a 3 week history of progressive dyspnea as well as two
   syncopal episodes during this admission.  He was found to have an
   aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3 today on cardiac
   catheterization.  CT Surgery is involved, and the patient is being
   worked up for AVR, likely early next week
    - F/U read on pre-op Carotid U/S
    - F/U CT Surgery recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology regarding clearance prior to surgery. Appreciate
   ID clearance.
    - Gentle diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure
    - Consider adding Dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension
    - Continue to hold home dose of Lisinopril
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had persistently elevated LFTs on
   this admission.  Hepatitis serologies were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM Ab were
   negative, and tox screen was negative.  EBV, CMV, and HSV are currently
   pending.  Hepatology is involved in the patient's care.  DDx includes
   shock liver [**1-24**] poor forward flow v. hepatic congestion [**1-24**] congestive
   heart failure v. medication effect in the setting of HAART v. EtOH
   abuse.
    - F/U Hepatology recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology prior to surgery regarding medical clearance
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  He had
   a cardiac cath yesterday which showed clean coronaries and no evidence
   of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - cont Lasix gtt with goal -1 to 2L today
   - monitor Cr, stop diuresis once Cr bumps
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na this morning was 130, which is
   increased from 127 on [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward
   renal flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis for goal -1L today.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was

   Disposition: CCU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis, and CAD, is being treated for critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. He presented with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events. Cardiac catheterization showed a cardiac index of 1.2, and CT surgery is involved in planning for possible aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including:

1. Transaminitis: Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are persisting, and Hepatology is involved in the patient's care. The differential diagnosis includes shock liver, poor forward flow, hepatic congestion, congestive heart failure, medication effect, and EtOH abuse.
2. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD and had a cardiac cath yesterday showing clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis. He is currently on ASA 325 mg daily and holding Atorvastatin due to elevated LFTs.
3. PUMP: The patient has elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. He is grossly volume overloaded, and the goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before surgery.
4. RHYTHM: The patient remains in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and will continue to be monitored on telemetry.
5. HIV: The patient has a history of HIV, and ID was consulted regarding guidance on restarting HAART therapy. ID recommends holding HAART therapy until after cardiac surgery.
6. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is increasing, likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH response, or liver dysfunction.
7. Macrocytic Anemia: This is likely secondary to EtOH use, and the patient was started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Worsening of aortic stenosis: The patient's condition may deteriorate if the aortic stenosis is not addressed promptly.
2. Liver failure: The patient's transaminitis may progress to liver failure if not managed effectively.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac condition may lead to arrhythmias, which could worsen his condition.
4. Renal failure: The patient's hyponatremia and elevated creatinine levels may indicate early signs of renal failure.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's elevated liver enzymes and hyponatremia may increase his risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Sepsis: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of catheters may increase his risk of developing sepsis.

To mitigate these risks, the patient will require close monitoring, aggressive management of his cardiac condition, and careful attention to his liver and renal function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  He
   presents with a 3 week history of progressive dyspnea as well as two
   syncopal episodes during this admission.  He was found to have an
   aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3 today on cardiac
   catheterization.  CT Surgery is involved, and the patient is being
   worked up for AVR, likely early next week
    - F/U read on pre-op Carotid U/S
    - F/U CT Surgery recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology regarding clearance prior to surgery. Appreciate
   ID clearance.
    - Gentle diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated, for goal of -1L.
    - Consider adding Dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension
    - Continue to hold home dose of Lisinopril
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had persistently elevated LFTs on
   this admission.  Hepatitis serologies were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM Ab were
   negative, and tox screen was negative.  EBV, CMV, and HSV are currently
   pending.  Hepatology is involved in the patient's care.  DDx includes
   shock liver [**1-24**] poor forward flow v. hepatic congestion [**1-24**] congestive
   heart failure v. medication effect in the setting of HAART v. EtOH
   abuse.
    - F/U Hepatology recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology prior to surgery regarding medical clearance
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  He had
   a cardiac cath yesterday which showed clean coronaries and no evidence
   of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na this morning was 130, which is
   increased from 127 on [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward
   renal flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis for goal -1L today.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
    - Continue Folate and thiamine.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old man with HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted with progressive dyspnea and syncopal events. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. He was started on gentle diuresis with Lasix and is being worked up for aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery. The patient has also been diagnosed with transaminitis, likely secondary to liver congestion or medication effect, and is being managed by hepatology. He has a history of CAD, and his cardiac cath showed clean coronaries with no evidence of stenosis. The patient's HIV is being managed by holding HAART therapy until after cardiac surgery. He has hyponatremia, likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and ADH response, and macrocytic anemia, likely secondary to EtOH use.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Cardiac arrest due to critical aortic stenosis
	* Heart failure exacerbation
	* Arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
	* Pneumonia
	* Respiratory failure
3. Renal Complications:

   negative, and tox screen was negative.  EBV, CMV, and HSV are currently
   pending.  Hepatology is involved in the patient's care.  DDx includes
   shock liver [**1-24**] poor forward flow v. hepatic congestion [**1-24**] congestive
   heart failure v. medication effect in the setting of HAART v. EtOH
   abuse.
    - F/U Hepatology recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology prior to surgery regarding medical clearance
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  He had
   a cardiac cath yesterday which showed clean coronaries and no evidence
   of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - cont Lasix gtt with goal -1 to 2L today
   - monitor Cr, stop diuresis once Cr bumps
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na this morning was 130, which is
   increased from 127 on [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward
   renal flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis for goal -1L today.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
    - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # ANTICOAG.- Vit K now for INR 1.6

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  He
   presents with a 3 week history of progressive dyspnea as well as two
   syncopal episodes during this admission.  He was found to have an
   aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3 today on cardiac
   catheterization.  CT Surgery is involved, and the patient is being
   worked up for AVR, likely early next week
    - F/U read on pre-op Carotid U/S
    - F/U CT Surgery recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology regarding clearance prior to surgery. Appreciate
   ID clearance.
    - Gentle diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure
    - Consider adding Dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension
    - Continue to hold home dose of Lisinopril
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had persistently elevated LFTs on
   this admission.  Hepatitis serologies were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM Ab were
   negative, and tox screen was negative.  EBV, CMV, and HSV are currently
   pending.  Hepatology is involved in the patient's care.  DDx includes
   shock liver [**1-24**] poor forward flow v. hepatic congestion [**1-24**] congestive
   heart failure v. medication effect in the setting of HAART v. EtOH
   abuse.
    - F/U Hepatology recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology prior to surgery regarding medical clearance
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  He had
   a cardiac cath yesterday which showed clean coronaries and no evidence
   of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - cont Lasix gtt with goal -1 to 2L today
   - monitor Cr, stop diuresis once Cr bumps
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na this morning was 130, which is
   increased from 127 on [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward
   renal flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis for goal -1L today.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
    - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # ANTICOAG.- Vit K now for INR 1.6

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events, and was found to have critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. He has been diagnosed with transaminitis, CAD, and macrocytic anemia.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.9°C (96.7°F)
* Heart rate: 102 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 103/78 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 inspirations per minute (ipm)
* SpO2: 97%
* CVP: 25 mmHg
* PAP: 60/40 mmHg

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.1-8.4 K/uL
* Hct: 35.0-37.0%
* Plt: 163-199 K/uL
* Cr: 1.1-1.3 mg/dL
* TCO2: 18-24 mmHg
* Glucose: 112-170 mg/dL
* LFTs: Elevated
* INR: 1.6
* Albumin: 3.6 g/dL
* LDH: 775 IU/L
* Ca++: 8.4 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.5 mg/dL
* PO4: 4.0 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions and treatment plans are:

* Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient is being worked up for aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery, likely early next week. He is being managed with gentle diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure, and consideration of adding Dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension.
* Transaminitis: The patient has persistently elevated LFTs, and is being managed with hepatology involvement. DDx includes shock liver, poor forward flow, hepatic congestion, congestive heart failure, medication effect, and EtOH abuse.
* CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, and had a cardiac cath yesterday which showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis. He is being managed with ASA 325 mg daily, and holding Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs.
* Macrocytic Anemia: The patient is being managed with Folate and Thiamine.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's critical aortic stenosis can lead to cardiogenic shock, and his CAD can lead to coronary artery occlusion.
* Liver complications: The patient's transaminitis can lead to liver failure, and his elevated LFTs can lead to bleeding complications.
* Renal complications: The patient's hyponatremia can lead to seizures, and his elevated Cr can lead to kidney failure.
* Infectious complications: The patient's immunosuppressed state can lead to infections, and his line placement can lead to line infections.
* Surgical complications: The patient's surgery can lead to bleeding complications, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.

Overall, the patient's condition is improving, and he is being managed with a multidisciplinary approach to optimize his care."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -3L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - F/U CT Surgery recs--much appreciated
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure, goal today
   -2L.
    - Consider adding Dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension
    - Continue to hold home dose of Lisinopril
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - cont Lasix gtt with goal -2L today
   - monitor Cr, stop diuresis once Cr bumps
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which is increased from
   127 on [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and
   appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis for goal -2L today.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
    - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # Coagulation.- Vit K now for INR 1.6

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -3L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - F/U CT Surgery recs--much appreciated
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure, goal today
   -2L.
    - Consider adding Dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension
    - Continue to hold home dose of Lisinopril
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - cont Lasix gtt with goal -2L today
   - monitor Cr, stop diuresis once Cr bumps

   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which is increased from
   127 on [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and
   appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis for goal -2L today.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted with progressive dyspnea and syncopal events, and was found to have critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: He is on nasal cannula oxygen with an SpO2 of 99%. His ABG results are pending.
* Cardiovascular: He has a history of CAD, with a cardiac index of 1.3 and aortic valve area of 0.3. He is waiting for aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery, likely early next week.
* Hemodynamics: His central venous pressure (CVP) is 31 mmHg, and his pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is 60/37 mmHg.
* Renal function: His creatinine (Cr) levels are elevated, and he is on diuresis with Lasix gtt to optimize fluid status prior to surgery.
* Liver function: He has elevated liver function tests (LFTs), but they appear to be improving. He is being monitored daily for LFT trends and INR levels.
* HIV: He has a history of HIV, with a CD4 count of 532 on [**2163-4-6**]. His HAART therapy is being held until after cardiac surgery.
* Other: He has a history of transaminitis, macrocytic anemia, and hyponatremia, which are being managed accordingly.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac complications: Aortic valve replacement surgery carries risks such as bleeding, infection, and arrhythmias.
* Renal complications: The patient's elevated Cr levels and diuresis may lead to further kidney damage or acute kidney injury.
* Liver complications: The patient's elevated LFTs and INR levels may indicate ongoing liver dysfunction or liver failure.
* HIV complications: The patient's HAART therapy is being held, which may lead to a resurgence of HIV symptoms or opportunistic infections.
* Other complications: The patient's history of CAD, transaminitis, macrocytic anemia, and hyponatremia may lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, liver failure, or electrolyte imbalances.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his cardiovascular, renal, and liver function. Further evaluation and management of his HIV infection and other underlying medical conditions are also necessary to ensure optimal outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  He
   presents with a 3 week history of progressive dyspnea as well as two
   syncopal episodes during this admission.  He was found to have an
   aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3 today on cardiac
   catheterization.  CT Surgery is involved, and the patient is being
   worked up for AVR, likely early next week
    - F/U read on pre-op Carotid U/S
    - F/U CT Surgery recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology regarding clearance prior to surgery. Appreciate
   ID clearance.
    - Gentle diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure
    - Consider adding Dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension
    - Continue to hold home dose of Lisinopril
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had persistently elevated LFTs on
   this admission.  Hepatitis serologies were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM Ab were
   negative, and tox screen was negative.  EBV, CMV, and HSV are currently
   pending.  Hepatology is involved in the patient's care.  DDx includes
   shock liver [**1-24**] poor forward flow v. hepatic congestion [**1-24**] congestive
   heart failure v. medication effect in the setting of HAART v. EtOH
   abuse.
    - F/U Hepatology recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology prior to surgery regarding medical clearance
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  He had
   a cardiac cath yesterday which showed clean coronaries and no evidence
   of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - cont Lasix gtt with goal -1 to 2L today
   - monitor Cr, stop diuresis once Cr bumps
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na this morning was 130, which is
   increased from 127 on [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward
   renal flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis for goal -1L today.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
    - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # ANTICOAG.- Vit K now for INR 1.6

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  He
   presents with a 3 week history of progressive dyspnea as well as two
   syncopal episodes during this admission.  He was found to have an
   aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3 today on cardiac
   catheterization.  CT Surgery is involved, and the patient is being
   worked up for AVR, likely early next week
    - F/U read on pre-op Carotid U/S
    - F/U CT Surgery recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology regarding clearance prior to surgery. Appreciate
   ID clearance.
    - Gentle diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure
    - Consider adding Dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension
    - Continue to hold home dose of Lisinopril
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had persistently elevated LFTs on
   this admission.  Hepatitis serologies were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM Ab were
   negative, and tox screen was negative.  EBV, CMV, and HSV are currently
   pending.  Hepatology is involved in the patient's care.  DDx includes
   shock liver [**1-24**] poor forward flow v. hepatic congestion [**1-24**] congestive
   heart failure v. medication effect in the setting of HAART v. EtOH
   abuse.
    - F/U Hepatology recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology prior to surgery regarding medical clearance
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  He had
   a cardiac cath yesterday which showed clean coronaries and no evidence
   of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - cont Lasix gtt with goal -1 to 2L today
   - monitor Cr, stop diuresis once Cr bumps
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na this morning was 130, which is
   increased from 127 on [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward
   renal flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis for goal -1L today.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old man with a complex medical history, including HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted to the ICU with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events. The patient has undergone cardiac catheterization, which revealed critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3, and he is being worked up for aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient's aortic valve area is severely narrowed, which can lead to cardiac failure, syncope, and even sudden death.
2. Transaminitis: The patient has persistently elevated liver function tests (LFTs), which may indicate liver damage or dysfunction. Hepatology is involved in the patient's care, and the differential diagnosis includes shock liver, hepatic congestion, congestive heart failure, medication effect, and EtOH abuse.
3. CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. He has clean coronaries on cardiac cath, but he is still at risk for cardiac events.
4. PUMP: The patient has elevated filling pressures, which may indicate cardiac failure or chronic diastolic heart failure. He is grossly volume overloaded and needs to be diuresed to reduce his fluid volume before surgery.
5. RHYTHM: The patient is in normal sinus rhythm (NSR), but he needs to be monitored for any changes in his cardiac rhythm.
6. HIV: The patient has a history of HIV and is on hold for HAART therapy until after cardiac surgery.
7. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, which may be secondary to poor forward renal flow, liver dysfunction, or other factors. He needs to be monitored for changes in his sodium level.
8. Macrocytic Anemia: The patient has a macrocytic anemia, which may be secondary to EtOH use. He is being treated with folate and thiamine.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue gentle diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure.
2. Consider adding dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension.
3. Hold home dose of Lisinopril.
4. Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily.
5. Continue to hold HAART medications.
6. Speak to hepatology prior to surgery regarding medical clearance.
7. Continue to follow sodium levels daily.
8. Continue Folate and thiamine for macrocytic anemia.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for cardiac events, and his medical condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications."

   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -3L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - F/U CT Surgery recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology regarding clearance prior to surgery. Appreciate
   ID clearance.
    - Diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure, goal today
   -2L.
    - Consider adding Dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension
    - Continue to hold home dose of Lisinopril
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   DDx includes shock liver [**1-24**] poor forward flow v.
   hepatic congestion [**1-24**] congestive heart failure v. medication effect in
   the setting of HAART v. EtOH abuse.  Hepatology has cleared pt for
   surgery and signed off.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - cont Lasix gtt with goal -2L today
   - monitor Cr, stop diuresis once Cr bumps

    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which is increased from
   127 on [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and
   appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis for goal -2L today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old man with a complex medical history, including HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted to the ICU with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamics: The patient's blood pressure is 90/74 mmHg, with a heart rate of 97 bpm and a cardiac index of 1.2 L/min/m2. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 31 mmHg, and his pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is 60/37 mmHg.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving oxygen via a nasal cannula at 2 L/min, with a SpO2 of 99%. His ABG results are normal.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3, and he is awaiting aortic valve replacement surgery. He also has a history of coronary artery disease, with a cardiac catheterization showing clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
* Renal function: The patient's creatinine level is 1.3 mg/dL, and his urine output is 1,689 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Liver function: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, with an alanine transaminase (ALT) level of 897 IU/L and an aspartate transaminase (AST) level of 787 IU/L. His total bilirubin level is 1.5 mg/dL.
* Fluid balance: The patient has a negative fluid balance of 3,074 mL over the past 24 hours, with a goal of diuresis of 2 L today.
* Electrolytes: The patient's sodium level is 131 mmol/L, which is increased from 127 mmol/L on the previous day. His potassium level is 3.2 mmol/L, and his magnesium level is 1.9 mmol/L.
* Anemia: The patient has a macrocytic anemia, likely secondary to ethanol use.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's critical aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease increase his risk of cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
* Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output increase his risk of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.
* Hepatic complications: The patient's elevated LFTs and liver dysfunction increase his risk of liver failure and portal hypertension.
* Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's hyponatremia and hypokalemia increase his risk of electrolyte imbalances and arrhythmias.
* Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state and indwelling catheters increase his risk of infections, including sepsis and pneumonia.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, it is recommended that he continue to receive close monitoring and management in the ICU. His diuresis should be continued to optimize his fluid status, and his LFTs and electrolyte levels should be closely monitored. Additionally, his anticoagulation therapy should be continued to prevent thrombosis, and his antiretroviral therapy should be held until after his cardiac surgery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -3L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - F/U CT Surgery recs--much appreciated!
    - Speak to hepatology regarding clearance prior to surgery. Appreciate
   ID clearance.
    - Diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure, goal today
   -2L.
    - Consider adding Dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension
    - Continue to hold home dose of Lisinopril
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   DDx includes shock liver [**1-24**] poor forward flow v.
   hepatic congestion [**1-24**] congestive heart failure v. medication effect in
   the setting of HAART v. EtOH abuse.  Hepatology has cleared pt for
   surgery and signed off.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - cont Lasix gtt with goal -2L today
   - monitor Cr, stop diuresis once Cr bumps
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which is increased from
   127 on [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and
   appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis for goal -2L today.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
    - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # ANTICOAG.- Vit K now for INR 1.6

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. The patient is currently in the ICU for optimization of fluid status prior to aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 90/74 mmHg. He has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 31 mmHg and a pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) of 60/37 mmHg. His cardiac index is 1.2 L/min/m2, and his mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 32%.

The patient has a history of transaminitis, which appears to be improving. His liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, but his hepatologist has cleared him for surgery. He is being held on HAART medications until after cardiac surgery.

The patient has a history of CAD, with a clean coronary catheterization and no evidence of stenosis. He is taking aspirin 325 mg daily and atorvastatin, which has been held due to elevated LFTs.

The patient's fluid status is optimized, with a goal of diuresis of -2L today. His creatinine (Cr) is elevated, but his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is normal. He has hyponatremia, which is likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) response.

The patient's anemia is likely macrocytic, secondary to ethanol use. He is being treated with folate and thiamine.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's critical aortic stenosis increases his risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
2. Renal complications: The patient's hyponatremia and elevated Cr levels increase his risk of renal failure.
3. Hepatic complications: The patient's transaminitis and elevated LFTs increase his risk of hepatic failure.
4. Pulmonary complications: The patient's chronic diastolic heart failure and gross volume overload increase his risk of pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
5. Infectious complications: The patient's HIV infection and immunosuppression increase his risk of opportunistic infections.

The patient's plan of care includes optimization of fluid status, diuresis, and management of his cardiac, renal, and hepatic function. He will continue to be monitored closely for any signs of cardiac or respiratory distress, and his plan will be adjusted accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -3L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - F/U CT Surgery recs--much appreciated
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure, goal today
   -2L.
    - Consider adding Dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension
    - Continue to hold home dose of Lisinopril
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - cont Lasix gtt with goal -2L today
   - monitor Cr, stop diuresis once Cr bumps
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which is increased from
   127 on [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and
   appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis for goal -2L today.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
    - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # Coagulation.- Vit K now for INR 1.6

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications may arise:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3, which may lead to cardiac arrest or sudden death.
	* Potential for arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, due to the patient's history of CAD and aortic stenosis.
2. Renal Complications:
	* Hypovolemia due to excessive diuresis, which may lead to acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic kidney disease.
	* Potential for electrolyte imbalances, such as hyponatremia, due to poor forward renal flow and ADH response.
3. Liver Complications:
	* Transaminitis with elevated LFTs, which may indicate liver dysfunction or congestion.
	* Potential for liver failure or worsening of liver disease, especially if the patient's HAART therapy is not restarted after cardiac surgery.
4. Hematological Complications:
	* Macrocytic anemia likely secondary to EtOH use, which may worsen if not properly managed.
	* Potential for bleeding complications due to the patient's history of CAD and aortic stenosis.
5. Infectious Complications:
	* Potential for opportunistic infections, such as CMV or EBV, due to the patient's history of HIV and immunosuppression.
	* Risk of hospital-acquired infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, due to the patient's prolonged hospitalization.
6. Nutritional Complications:
	* Malnutrition due to poor appetite, nausea, or vomiting, which may worsen the patient's overall health and increase the risk of complications.
7. Psychological Complications:
	* Anxiety or depression due to the patient's critical illness, which may affect their mental status and overall well-being.

The patient's care should focus on managing these potential complications, including:

* Optimal fluid management to prevent hypovolemia and hypervolemia.
* Monitoring of liver function tests and electrolyte levels to prevent complications.
* Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac status, including arrhythmias and cardiac output.
* Proper management of the patient's HIV infection, including restarting HAART therapy after cardiac surgery.
* Nutritional support to prevent malnutrition and promote overall health.
* Psychological support to address anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns."

   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -1.8L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
   - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Diuresis with Lasix IV/PO as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of
   even to -500ccs today.  Off lasix for now.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications

   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.

    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**].  His hyponatremia was likely secondary to poor
   forward renal flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.5L length of stay. Goal now even to slightly negative.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease, who presented with progressive dyspnea and syncopal events. He has critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3 and is awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery. The patient is currently in the ICU for optimization of fluid status before surgery.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated LFTs (ALT: 602 IU/L, AST: 453 IU/L) with a trend towards improvement
* Elevated Cr (1.4 mg/dL) with a slight increase yesterday
* Hyponatremia (Na: 131 mmol/L) with a steady increase since June 30th
* Macrocytic anemia likely secondary to EtOH use
* Elevated INR (1.3) with a recent dose of VitK on July 1st

The patient is receiving diuresis with Lasix IV/PO as tolerated by blood pressure, with a goal of even to -500ccs today. He is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin SC for DVT prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Critical aortic stenosis may lead to cardiac arrest or sudden death if not addressed with AVR surgery.
	* Elevated filling pressures may increase the risk of pulmonary edema or cardiac failure.
2. Renal Complications:
	* Hyponatremia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to seizures, coma, or even death.
	* Elevated Cr may indicate kidney damage or failure if not addressed.
3. Hepatic Complications:
	* Transaminitis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to liver failure or increased risk of bleeding.
4. Hematological Complications:
	* Macrocytic anemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased risk of bleeding or anemia-related complications.
5. Infectious Complications:
	* HIV may increase the risk of opportunistic infections if not managed properly.
6. Coagulation Complications:
	* Elevated INR may increase the risk of bleeding or hemorrhage if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to optimize fluid status before surgery.
2. Monitor LFTs and INR daily.
3. Continue to hold HAART medications until after cardiac surgery.
4. Manage hyponatremia and Cr levels closely.
5. Monitor for signs of cardiac complications, such as pulmonary edema or cardiac failure.
6. Monitor for signs of renal complications, such as increased Cr or decreased urine output.
7. Monitor for signs of hepatic complications, such as worsening transaminitis or increased bilirubin.
8. Monitor for signs of hematological complications, such as worsening anemia or bleeding.
9. Monitor for signs of infectious complications, such as fever or increased white blood cell count.
10. Monitor for signs of coagulation complications, such as bleeding or hemorrhage."

   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -1.8L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
   - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Diuresis with Lasix IV/PO as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of
   ~-2L met yesterday so Lasix gtt discontinued.
   - Consider adding Dopamine if becomes hypotensive
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diurese as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - Cr did bump yesterday to 1.4 but trended back down.
   - D/C Lasix gtt, will continue gentle diuresis for now w/ goal as much
   as tolerated

   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**].  His hyponatremia was likely secondary to poor
   forward renal flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis today w/ PO/IV Lasix as tolerated. Pt is
   now -1.5L length of stay.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Cardiac complications: Critical aortic stenosis can lead to cardiac arrest, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
* Respiratory complications: Severe dyspnea and potential fluid overload can lead to respiratory failure.
* Renal complications: Hyponatremia and potential fluid overload can lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
* Hepatic complications: Elevated LFTs can indicate liver dysfunction, which may worsen if not managed properly.
* Anemia: Macrocytic anemia can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

**Plan:**

* Continue diuresis with Lasix IV/PO to optimize fluid status prior to surgery
* Monitor LFTs and INR daily
* Hold HAART medications until after cardiac surgery
* Continue ASA 325 mg daily
* Continue to hold Atorvastatin and Lisinopril in the setting of elevated LFTs and critical aortic stenosis
* Monitor for signs of cardiac, respiratory, renal, and hepatic complications
* Consider adding dopamine if the patient becomes hypotensive
* Continue gentle diuresis today with PO/IV Lasix as tolerated."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -3L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - F/U CT Surgery recs--much appreciated
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure, goal today
   -2L.
    - Consider adding Dopamine if Lasix gtt induces hypotension
    - Continue to hold home dose of Lisinopril
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - cont Lasix gtt with goal -2L today
   - monitor Cr, stop diuresis once Cr bumps
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which is increased from
   127 on [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and
   appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis for goal -2L today.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
    - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # Coagulation.- Vit K now for INR 1.6

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   volume overloaded and goal is to diuresis as much as tolerated before
   surgery.

   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which is increased from
   127 on [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease. He presented with progressive dyspnea and syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. He is awaiting aortic valve replacement surgery, likely early next week. The patient is currently in the ICU for optimization of fluid status prior to surgery. His laboratory results show elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and coagulation parameters, as well as hyponatremia and macrocytic anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiovascular:
	* Critical aortic stenosis: the patient's condition is worsening, and surgery is needed to replace the aortic valve.
	* Coronary artery disease: the patient has a history of CAD, and the condition may worsen if not managed properly.
2. Liver:
	* Transaminitis: the patient's LFTs are elevated, and the cause is likely hepatic congestion.
	* Hepatitis: the patient has been tested for hepatitis, and the results are negative, but the condition may still be present.
3. Renal:
	* Hyponatremia: the patient's sodium levels are low, which may be secondary to poor forward renal flow and ADH response.
	* Acute kidney injury: the patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and the condition may worsen if not managed properly.
4. Hematological:
	* Macrocytic anemia: the patient's anemia is likely secondary to EtOH use and may worsen if not managed properly.
5. Infection:
	* HIV: the patient has a history of HIV, and the condition may worsen if not managed properly.
	* Bacterial infections: the patient is at risk of developing bacterial infections, particularly in the setting of a compromised immune system.

Plan:

1. Cardiovascular:
	* Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as necessary.
	* Prepare the patient for aortic valve replacement surgery.
2. Liver:
	* Continue to monitor the patient's LFTs and adjust treatment as necessary.
	* Consider further testing to determine the cause of the transaminitis.
3. Renal:
	* Continue to monitor the patient's creatinine levels and adjust treatment as necessary.
	* Consider further testing to determine the cause of the hyponatremia.
4. Hematological:
	* Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust treatment as necessary.
	* Consider further testing to determine the cause of the macrocytic anemia.
5. Infection:
	* Continue to monitor the patient's HIV status and adjust treatment as necessary.
	* Consider further testing to determine the presence of bacterial infections."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -1.8L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
   - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Diuresis with Lasix IV/PO as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of
   even to -500ccs today.  Off lasix for now.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as
   much as will be tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump yesterday to 1.4 but trended back down.
   - D/C Lasix gtt, will continue gentle diuresis for now w/ goal as much
   as tolerated
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**].  His hyponatremia was likely secondary to poor
   forward renal flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.5L length of stay. Goal now even to slightly negative.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   -          Continue Folate and thiamine.
   -
   # Coagulation.- VitK on Friday, [**2163-7-1**]. INR now 1.3

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -1.8L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
   - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Diuresis with Lasix IV/PO as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of
   even to -500ccs today.  Off lasix for now.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as
   much as will be tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump yesterday to 1.4 but trended back down.
   - D/C Lasix gtt, will continue gentle diuresis for now w/ goal as much
   as tolerated
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**].  His hyponatremia was likely secondary to poor
   forward renal flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.5L length of stay. Goal now even to slightly negative.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   -          Continue Folate and thiamine.
   -
   # Coagulation.- VitK on Friday, [**2163-7-1**]. INR now 1.3

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 9570**].

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He was admitted to the ICU with critical aortic stenosis and is awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 106/36 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His respiratory rate is 19 inspirations per minute, and he is receiving no respiratory support.

The patient has been diuresed with Lasix IV and PO, with a goal of even to -500ccs per day. His fluid balance is -1,866 mL, and his creatinine level has increased to 1.4 mg/dL. His liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down, and his albumin level is 3.6 g/dL.

The patient has a history of CAD, with a previous stent placement in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. He is receiving aspirin 325 mg daily and atorvastatin, which is being held due to elevated LFTs.

The patient has also been diagnosed with transaminitis, likely secondary to hepatic congestion. His LFTs are being trended daily, and he is being held on HAART therapy until after cardiac surgery.

The patient has a history of hyponatremia, which is likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) response versus liver dysfunction. His sodium level is 131 mmol/L, and he is being followed daily.

The patient has a macrocytic anemia, likely secondary to ethanol use. He is being treated with folate and thiamine.

The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3. He is receiving vitamin K, and his INR is being monitored daily.

The patient is at risk for several potential medical complications, including:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has critical aortic stenosis and is awaiting AVR surgery. He is at risk for cardiac complications, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of CAD and is at risk for respiratory complications, including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Renal complications: The patient has hyponatremia and is at risk for further renal dysfunction, including acute kidney injury (AKI).
4. Hepatic complications: The patient has transaminitis and is at risk for further liver dysfunction, including liver failure.
5. Coagulation complications: The patient has an abnormal coagulation profile and is at risk for bleeding complications, including hemorrhage.
6. Infection: The patient has a history of HIV and is at risk for opportunistic infections, including pneumonia and sepsis.
7. Malnutrition: The patient has a history of malnutrition and is at risk for further malnutrition and related complications, including weakness, fatigue, and decreased wound healing.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but he is at risk for several potential medical complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -1.8L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
   - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Diuresis with Lasix gtt as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of ~-2L
   met yesterday so Lasix gtt discontinued.
   - Will continue home dose of lisinopril
    - Consider adding Dopamine if becomes hypotensive
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. However, he is grossly
   volume overloaded and goal is to diurese as much as tolerated before
   surgery.
   - Cr did bump yesterday to 1.4 but trended back down.
   - D/C Lasix gtt, will continue gentle diuresis for now w/ goal as much
   as tolerated
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**].  This is likely secondary to poor forward renal
   flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Continue gentle diuresis
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   -          Continue Folate and thiamine.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis resolving, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this week.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +185mL with creatinine stable at 1.3.
   - CT surgery following,  fu date of AVR
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, resume diuresis with Lasix IV/PO
   as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of even to -500ccs today.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Continues to trend downwards.  Hepatitis serologies
   and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was
   negative.  ? EBV and HSV may have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic
   congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Change ASA to 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 two days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**], now stable for two days.  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.5L length of stay. Goal now even to slightly negative.
   .
   #Anxiety:
   - Will start 0.5mg PO Ativan
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis resolving, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this week.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +185mL with creatinine stable at 1.3.
   - CT surgery following,  fu date of AVR
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, resume diuresis with Lasix IV/PO
   as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of even to -500ccs today.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Continues to trend downwards.  Hepatitis serologies
   and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was
   negative.  ? EBV and HSV may have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic
   congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Change ASA to 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 two days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**], now stable for two days.  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.5L length of stay. Goal now even to slightly negative.
   .
   #Anxiety:
   - Will start 0.5mg PO Ativan
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # Coagulation.- VitK on Friday, [**2163-7-1**]. INR now 1.4

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.1, waiting
   now for AVR, likely Wednesday.  Hypotensive this morning, Lasix held.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +185mL with creatinine stable at 1.3.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, resume diuresis with Lasix IV/PO
   as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of even to -500ccs today.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.1, waiting
   now for AVR, likely Wednesday.  Hypotensive this morning, Lasix held.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +185mL with creatinine stable at 1.3.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, resume diuresis with Lasix IV/PO
   as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of even to -500ccs today.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Change ASA to 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as
   much as will be tolerated before surgery. Lasix drip held yesterday
   given hyoptension
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 two days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt, will continue gentle diuresis for now w/
   goal as much as tolerated

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted with progressive dyspnea and syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with critical aortic stenosis. He is awaiting aortic valve replacement surgery, likely on Wednesday. The patient's condition has been stable, with no significant changes in his vital signs or laboratory results.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's critical aortic stenosis and cardiogenic shock put him at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Renal Complications: The patient's history of renal dysfunction and hyponatremia may increase his risk for acute kidney injury or worsening renal function.
3. Hepatic Complications: The patient's transaminitis and elevated liver enzymes may indicate liver dysfunction, which could worsen if not managed properly.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and history of HIV infection make him susceptible to infections, particularly opportunistic infections.
5. Thrombotic Complications: The patient's history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism may increase his risk for thrombotic complications, particularly if he develops immobility or other risk factors.
6. Nutritional Complications: The patient's malnutrition and history of ethanol use may increase his risk for nutritional deficiencies, particularly protein-energy malnutrition.
7. Psychological Complications: The patient's anxiety and depression may worsen if not managed properly, which could impact his recovery and overall well-being.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including his vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory results.
2. Optimize the patient's fluid management to prevent worsening renal function and hyponatremia.
3. Continue to manage the patient's transaminitis and elevated liver enzymes with close monitoring and medication adjustments as necessary.
4. Implement measures to prevent infections, such as proper hand hygiene, isolation precautions, and antibiotic stewardship.
5. Monitor the patient's thrombotic risk factors and consider prophylactic anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
6. Provide the patient with a balanced diet and consider nutritional supplements if necessary.
7. Manage the patient's anxiety and depression with appropriate medications and counseling."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely Wednesday.  Hypotensive to 84/56 yesterday so
   diuretics held.  Yesterday, fluid balance was +185mL with creatinine
   stable at 1.3.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, resume diuresis with Lasix IV/PO
   as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of even to -500ccs today.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as
   much as will be tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 two days ago, now at 1.3.
   - D/C Lasix gtt, will continue gentle diuresis for now w/ goal as much
   as tolerated
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**], now stable for two days.  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.5L length of stay. Goal now even to slightly negative.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # Coagulation.- VitK on Friday, [**2163-7-1**]. INR now 1.4

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis, and CAD, who was admitted with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events. He has a critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3 and is waiting for aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery. He has been experiencing hypotension and is being treated with diuretics. His liver function tests (LFTs) have been elevated, but are improving. He has also been experiencing transaminitis, which is likely secondary to hepatic congestion. His cardiac catheterization showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis. He has a history of CAD and is being treated with aspirin and holding atorvastatin and lisinopril. He is also being treated for hyponatremia and macrocytic anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's critical aortic stenosis and CAD increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
2. Liver complications: The patient's transaminitis and elevated LFTs increase his risk of liver damage and failure.
3. Renal complications: The patient's hyponatremia and elevated creatinine levels increase his risk of renal damage and failure.
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV increases his risk of infection, particularly with opportunistic pathogens.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia increase his risk of bleeding complications, particularly during surgery.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is at risk of developing respiratory failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's syncopal episodes increase his risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust his treatment plan as necessary.
2. Continue to treat his liver dysfunction with diuretics and hold HAART therapy until after cardiac surgery.
3. Monitor his renal function closely and adjust his fluid and electrolyte management as necessary.
4. Continue to treat his hyponatremia and macrocytic anemia.
5. Consider consulting with a specialist, such as a cardiologist or hepatologist, to help manage the patient's complex medical condition.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust his treatment plan as necessary.
7. Consider consulting with a neurologist to help manage the patient's neurological symptoms and prevent future episodes."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have critical aortic stenosis
   with valve area of 0.3.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely early next week.  Now diuresing to optimize fluid
   status prior to surgery.  Yesterday was -1.8L with only slight Cr
   increase and reports feeling better.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
   - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Diuresis with Lasix IV/PO as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of
   even to -500ccs today.  Off lasix for now.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 325 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as
   much as will be tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump yesterday to 1.4 but trended back down.
   - D/C Lasix gtt, will continue gentle diuresis for now w/ goal as much
   as tolerated
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted yesterday regarding guidance on when to restart the
   patient's HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until
   after cardiac surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**].  His hyponatremia was likely secondary to poor
   forward renal flow and appropriate ADH response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.5L length of stay. Goal now even to slightly negative.
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   -          Continue Folate and thiamine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted with progressive dyspnea and syncopal events, and was found to have critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. He is awaiting aortic valve replacement surgery, likely early next week. The patient is currently being diuresed to optimize fluid status prior to surgery.

Medical Complications:

1. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient's aortic stenosis is severe and progressive, which is causing symptoms of dyspnea and syncopal events. He is at risk for further complications if his condition is not managed properly.
2. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver function tests, which may be due to hepatic congestion or another underlying cause. Further monitoring and management are needed to ensure his liver function improves.
3. CAD: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, and his cardiac catheterization showed clean coronaries with no evidence of stenosis. However, he is still at risk for further cardiac complications.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which may be due to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH response, or liver dysfunction. Close monitoring is needed to ensure his sodium levels normalize.
5. Macrocytic Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to ethanol use, and he is being treated with folate and thiamine.
6. Coagulation Abnormalities: The patient's INR is elevated, which may be due to liver dysfunction or another underlying cause. Close monitoring is needed to ensure his coagulation status improves.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest, due to his critical aortic stenosis.
2. Respiratory Complications: The patient may be at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, due to his compromised respiratory status.
3. Renal Complications: The patient may be at risk for renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, due to his hyponatremia and potential liver dysfunction.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly with his compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to ensure his medical conditions are stable and to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.3, waiting
   now for AVR, likely Wednesday.  Hypotensive this morning with Lasix
   held.  Yesterday, fluid balance was +185mL with creatinine stable at
   1.3.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, resume diuresis with Lasix IV/PO
   as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of even to -500ccs today.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  The patient has had elevated LFTs, though they appear
   to be improving.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Change ASA to 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP: Elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and
   compensated. No pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as
   much as will be tolerated before surgery. Lasix drip held yesterday
   given hyoptension
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 two days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt, will continue gentle diuresis for now w/
   goal as much as tolerated
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**], now stable for two days.  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.5L length of stay. Goal now even to slightly negative.
   .
   #Anxiety:
   - Will start 0.5mg PO Ativan
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # Coagulation.- VitK on Friday, [**2163-7-1**]. INR now 1.4

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old man with a complex medical history, including HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted to the ICU with cardiogenic shock and is awaiting aortic valve replacement surgery.

The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/75 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination is significant for a loud systolic murmur radiating to the carotids, faint diastolic murmur at the left sternal border, and slight heave over the precordium. His abdomen is distended, and he has 1+ edema in his ankles up to the mid-shins.

Laboratory results show elevated liver function tests (LFTs), with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 473 U/L and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 591 U/L. His creatinine level is 1.3 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 27 mg/dL.

The patient's medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, atorvastatin, lisinopril, and lasix, which was held due to hypotension. He is also receiving folate and thiamine for his macrocytic anemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's critical aortic stenosis and cardiogenic shock make him at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
2. Liver dysfunction: The patient's elevated LFTs and transaminitis suggest liver dysfunction, which can progress to liver failure if not managed properly.
3. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and BUN level suggest renal dysfunction, which can progress to renal failure if not managed properly.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic diastolic heart failure and pulmonary congestion make him at risk for respiratory complications, such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV and his recent surgery make him at risk for infection, particularly sepsis and pneumonia.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy with heparin sodium makes him at risk for bleeding complications, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial bleeding.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications due to his complex medical history and current condition. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications effectively."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis resolving, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this Wednesday.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +165mL, and past 12 hours -160mL; total
   -5mL, not at goal of -500cc, with a mild creatinine increase at 1.4
   from 1.3.
   - CT surgery following, will make decision today if patient is stable
   for surgery.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension and now increasing Cr, attempt
   goal of even to -500ccs today, as patient is still fluid overloaded,
   but based on BUN/Cr appearing pre-renal, do not over-diurese. Continue
   fluid restriction of 1500 cc.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  ALT trending down, AST slightly increased,
   essentially unchanged.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**]
   and SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV
   may have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion plus
   significant alcohol ingestion prior to admission.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 two days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is ___, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**], now stable for two days.  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.3L length of stay. Goal now even to slightly negative.
   .
   #Anxiety: Improved with Ativan
   - Continue 0.5mg PO Ativan prn
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # Coagulation.- VitK on Friday, [**2163-7-1**]. INR now 1.4

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old man with a complex medical history, including HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease. He is currently in the ICU awaiting aortic valve replacement surgery.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 94/62 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. His oxygen saturation is 100%, and he is receiving oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including ALT and AST, which are likely due to transaminitis. His creatinine level has increased to 1.4 mg/dL, and his potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L. His international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.4, indicating a mild coagulopathy.

The patient is receiving treatment for anxiety with Ativan, and his anxiety has improved with this medication. He is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis.

The patient's fluid balance is a concern, with a net fluid intake of -165 mL over the past 12 hours. His creatinine level has increased, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine ratio suggests pre-renal azotemia. The patient's fluid restriction has been increased to 1500 mL per day.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a cardiac index of 1.1, indicating cardiogenic shock. His cardiac output is decreased, and his systemic vascular resistance is increased.

The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a mild hyponatremia. His magnesium level is 2.5 mg/dL, and his phosphorus level is 3.7 mg/dL.

The patient's medication list includes ASA 81 mg daily, omeprazole 20 mg daily, and atorvastatin 10 mg daily. He is also receiving heparin 5000 units subcutaneously every 12 hours.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac index is 1.1, indicating cardiogenic shock. His cardiac output is decreased, and his systemic vascular resistance is increased.
2. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, indicating transaminitis. His INR is 1.4, indicating a mild coagulopathy.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is 135 mEq/L, indicating mild hyponatremia.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is a concern, with a net fluid intake of -165 mL over the past 12 hours.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is 1.4, indicating a mild coagulopathy.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continue ASA 81 mg daily.
2. Continue omeprazole 20 mg daily.
3. Continue atorvastatin 10 mg daily.
4. Continue heparin 5000 units subcutaneously every 12 hours.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis stable, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this Wednesday.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +165mL, and past 12 hours -160mL; total
   -5mL, with a creatinine of 1.3, Stable from yesterday.
   - CT surgery following, will make decision today if patient is stable
   for surgery.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, attempt goal of even to -500ccs
   today; patient is still fluid overloaded, but based on BUN/Cr
   elevation, do not over-diurese. Continue fluid restriction of 1.5L.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Enzymes slightly from yesterday ALT (591 -> 578)AST
   (473 -> 585) Tbili (1.8 -> 2.0), and INR  stable at 1.4. All
   essentially stable for now, although concern for increasing
   decompenstation.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion plus significant
   alcohol ingestion prior to admission.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 127 today, down from 131
   yesterday, but has increased from 124 since [**6-29**].  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction
Hypervolemic hyponatremia
    - In order to correct Na levels, diuresis is needed. Given patient
   poor renal function, will hold for now. Will encourage CT surgery to
   perform surgery soon as concern for decompensation mounting.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.3L length of stay. Goal met: even to slightly negative.
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 three days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   #Anxiety: Improved with Ativan
   - Continue 0.5mg PO Ativan prn
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis stable, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this Wednesday.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +165mL, and past 12 hours -160mL; total
   -5mL, with a creatinine of 1.3, Stable from yesterday.
   - CT surgery following, will make decision today if patient is stable
   for surgery.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, attempt goal of even to -500ccs
   today; patient is still fluid overloaded, but based on BUN/Cr
   elevation, do not over-diurese. Continue fluid restriction of 1.5L.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Enzymes slightly from yesterday ALT (591 -> 578)AST
   (473 -> 585) Tbili (1.8 -> 2.0), and INR  stable at 1.4. All
   essentially stable for now, although concern for increasing
   decompenstation.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion plus significant
   alcohol ingestion prior to admission.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 127 today, down from 131
   yesterday, but has increased from 124 since [**6-29**].  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction
Hypervolemic hyponatremia
    - In order to correct Na levels, diuresis is needed. Given patient
   poor renal function, will hold for now. Will encourage CT surgery to
   perform surgery soon as concern for decompensation mounting.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.3L length of stay. Goal met: even to slightly negative.
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 three days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   #Anxiety: Improved with Ativan
   - Continue 0.5mg PO Ativan prn
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # Coagulation.- VitK on Friday, [**2163-7-1**]. INR now 1.4

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

1. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.1. He is awaiting AVR, likely this Wednesday.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient is in cardiogenic shock with a cardiac index of 1.1, and his fluid balance is still positive, indicating fluid overload.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has transaminitis with elevated ALT and AST levels, which are stable for now. The likely cause is hepatic congestion and significant alcohol ingestion prior to admission.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH response. Diuresis is needed to correct sodium levels, but this is being held due to the patient's poor renal function.
5. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, with a clean coronary catheterization showing no evidence of stenosis.
6. PUMP/Chronic Decompensated Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. He has been diuresed as much as tolerated before surgery.
7. Rhythm: The patient is in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and will continue to be monitored on telemetry.
8. HIV: The patient has a history of HIV, and ID consultation recommends holding HAART therapy until after cardiac surgery.
9. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety has improved with Ativan, and he will continue to receive 0.5mg PO Ativan prn.
10. Macrocytic Anemia: The patient has a macrocytic anemia likely secondary to EtOH use, and he is being treated with Folate and Thiamine.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's critical aortic stenosis and cardiogenic shock put him at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, or heart failure.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's fluid overload and chronic diastolic HF increase his risk for respiratory complications, such as pulmonary edema or respiratory failure.
3. Hepatic complications: The patient's transaminitis and liver dysfunction increase his risk for further hepatic complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy or liver failure.
4. Renal complications: The patient's hyponatremia and fluid overload put him at risk for further renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to HIV and his recent hospitalization increase his risk for infection.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's coagulopathy and anticoagulation therapy put him at risk for bleeding complications, such as hemorrhage or hematoma.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications and optimize his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis resolving, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this Wednesday.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +165mL, and past 12 hours -160mL; total
   -5mL, with a creatinine of ____, increased/decreased from yesterday of
   1.3.
   - CT surgery following, will make decision today if patient is stable
   for surgery.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension and now increasing Cr, attempt
   goal of even to -500ccs today;  patient is still fluid overloaded, but
   based on BUN/Cr appearing pre-renal, do not over-diurese. Continue
   fluid restriction of 1.5L.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  ALT/AST trending ________ and INR ______.
   Improving/Stable Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM
   Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may have
   been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion plus significant alcohol
   ingestion prior to admission.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 two days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is ___, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**], now stable for two days.  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.3L length of stay. Goal now even to slightly negative.
   .
   #Anxiety: Improved with Ativan
   - Continue 0.5mg PO Ativan prn
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old man with a complex medical history, including HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease. He is currently in the ICU awaiting aortic valve replacement surgery.

The patient's condition has been stable, with a net fluid balance of -5 mL over the past 24 hours. His creatinine level has increased to 1.3, but his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine (Cr) ratio suggests that his kidney function is pre-renal. His liver function tests (LFTs) are trending towards normal, and his INR is stable at 1.4.

The patient's cardiac index is 1.1, and he has a history of cardiogenic shock. His cardiac catheterization showed clean coronaries with no evidence of stenosis. He has a history of CAD, which is being managed with ASA 81 mg daily.

The patient's HIV status is well-controlled, with a CD4 count of 532 on [**2163-4-6**]. His ID consultant has recommended holding his HAART therapy until after cardiac surgery.

The patient has a history of transaminitis, which is improving, and his hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative. He has a history of CAD, which is being managed with ASA 81 mg daily.

The patient's anxiety has improved with Ativan, and he is receiving prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer. He is also receiving Folate and Thiamine for his macrocytic anemia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's critical aortic stenosis and cardiogenic shock make him at risk for further cardiac complications, including cardiac arrest or cardiac failure.
2. Renal complications: The patient's increasing creatinine level and pre-renal BUN/Cr ratio suggest that he may be at risk for further renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury.
3. Liver complications: The patient's transaminitis and INR of 1.4 suggest that he may be at risk for further liver dysfunction or bleeding complications.
4. HIV-related complications: The patient's HIV status and CD4 count of 532 make him at risk for opportunistic infections or HIV-related complications, such as pneumocystis pneumonia or cryptococcal meningitis.
5. Nutritional complications: The patient's fluid and salt restriction may lead to nutritional deficiencies or electrolyte imbalances.
6. Anxiolytic complications: The patient's use of Ativan may lead to sedation, respiratory depression, or withdrawal symptoms if discontinued abruptly.
7. Coagulation complications: The patient's INR of 1.4 and use of heparin may lead to bleeding complications or coagulopathy.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust his medications and treatment plan as needed to minimize the risk of these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis stable, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this Wednesday.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +165mL, and past 12 hours -160mL; total
   -5mL, with a creatinine of 1.3, Stable from yesterday.
    - CT surgery following, will make decision today if patient is stable
   for surgery.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, attempt goal of even to -500ccs
   today; patient is still fluid overloaded, but based on BUN/Cr
   elevation, do not over-diurese. Continue fluid restriction of 1.5L.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Enzymes slightly from yesterday ALT (591 -> 578)AST
   (473 -> 585) Tbili (1.8 -> 2.0), and INR  stable at 1.4. All
   essentially stable for now, although concern for increasing
   decompenstation.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion plus significant
   alcohol ingestion prior to admission.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 127 today, down from 131
   yesterday, but has increased from 124 since [**6-29**].  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction
Hypervolemic hyponatremia
    - In order to correct Na levels, diuresis is needed. Given patient
   poor renal function, will hold for now. Will encourage CT surgery to
   perform surgery soon as concern for decompensation mounting.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.3L length of stay. Goal met: even to slightly negative.
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 three days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   #Anxiety: Improved with Ativan
   - Continue 0.5mg PO Ativan prn
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis stable, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this Wednesday.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +165mL, and past 12 hours -160mL; total
   -5mL, with a creatinine of 1.3, Stable from yesterday.
    - CT surgery following, will make decision today if patient is stable
   for surgery.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, attempt goal of even to -500ccs
   today; patient is still fluid overloaded, but based on BUN/Cr
   elevation, do not over-diurese. Continue fluid restriction of 1.5L.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Enzymes slightly from yesterday ALT (591 -> 578)AST
   (473 -> 585) Tbili (1.8 -> 2.0), and INR  stable at 1.4. All
   essentially stable for now, although concern for increasing
   decompenstation.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion plus significant
   alcohol ingestion prior to admission.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 127 today, down from 131
   yesterday, but has increased from 124 since [**6-29**].  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction
Hypervolemic hyponatremia
    - In order to correct Na levels, diuresis is needed. Given patient
   poor renal function, will hold for now. Will encourage CT surgery to
   perform surgery soon as concern for decompensation mounting.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.3L length of stay. Goal met: even to slightly negative.
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 three days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   #Anxiety: Improved with Ativan
   - Continue 0.5mg PO Ativan prn
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # Coagulation.- VitK on Friday, [**2163-7-1**]. INR now 1.4

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's condition and potential medical complications that can arise:

Patient Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis, and CAD. He presented with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events, leading to cardiogenic shock with a cardiac index of 1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. He has been optimized for maximal diuresis and is awaiting AVR, likely this Wednesday.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Critical aortic stenosis can lead to cardiac failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death.
	* Cardiogenic shock can worsen if not managed properly.
2. Renal Complications:
	* Hyponatremia can lead to seizures, coma, and death if not corrected.
	* Renal failure can worsen if diuresis is not optimal.
3. Hepatic Complications:
	* Transaminitis can worsen if not managed properly, leading to liver failure.
	* Hepatic congestion can worsen if fluid overload is not addressed.
4. Infection Complications:
	* HIV can lead to opportunistic infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
	* Bacterial infections can occur due to indwelling catheters or other invasive procedures.
5. Neurological Complications:
	* Syncope can lead to falls, head trauma, or other neurological injuries.
	* Cardiac arrhythmias can worsen if not managed properly, leading to cardiac arrest.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Hepatic congestion can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, ascites, or other complications.
	* Malnutrition can worsen if not addressed, leading to further complications.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis stable, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this Wednesday.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +165mL, and past 12 hours -160mL; total
   -5mL, with a creatinine of 1.3, Stable from yesterday.
    - CT surgery following, will make decision today if patient is stable
   for surgery.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, attempt goal of even to -500ccs
   today; patient is still fluid overloaded, but based on BUN/Cr
   elevation, do not over-diurese. Continue fluid restriction of 1.5L.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Enzymes slightly from yesterday ALT (591 -> 578)AST
   (473 -> 585) Tbili (1.8 -> 2.0), and INR  stable at 1.4. All
   essentially stable for now, although concern for increasing
   decompenstation.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion plus significant
   alcohol ingestion prior to admission.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 127 today, down from 131
   yesterday, but has increased from 124 since [**6-29**].  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction
Hypervolemic hyponatremia
    - In order to correct Na levels, diuresis is needed. Given patient
   poor renal function, will hold for now. Will encourage CT surgery to
   perform surgery soon as concern for decompensation mounting.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.3L length of stay. Goal met: even to slightly negative.
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 three days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   #Anxiety: Improved with Ativan
   - Continue 0.5mg PO Ativan prn
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with progressive dyspnea and syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with a cardiac index of 1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. He is awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery, likely this Wednesday.

The patient's fluid balance has been inconsistent, with a net fluid loss of -5mL over the past 12 hours. His creatinine level has been stable at 1.3, and his liver function tests (LFTs) have been trending downward. He has been experiencing transaminitis, with elevated ALT and AST levels, and his international normalized ratio (INR) has been stable at 1.4.

The patient has also been experiencing hyponatremia, with a sodium level of 127 today. His hyponatremia is likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) response, rather than liver dysfunction.

The patient has a history of CAD and has undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81mg daily and has been advised to hold atorvastatin and lisinopril due to elevated LFTs and critical aortic stenosis, respectively.

The patient's rhythm has been normal sinus rhythm (NSR) and has been monitored on telemetry. He has also been experiencing anxiety, which has improved with ativan 0.5mg po q8h prn.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiogenic shock is a significant concern, and his cardiac index of 1.1 indicates that his heart is not able to pump enough blood to meet his body's needs. This increases his risk of further decompensation and death.
2. Transaminitis: The patient's transaminitis is a concern, as elevated liver enzymes can indicate liver damage or dysfunction. His INR of 1.4 is within normal limits, but his LFTs are trending downward, indicating ongoing liver dysfunction.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is a concern, as it can lead to seizures, coma, and death if left untreated. His sodium level of 127 is below normal, and his hyponatremia is likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH response.
4. CAD: The patient's history of CAD and PCI to the LAD artery increases his risk of further cardiac events, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
5. HIV: The patient's history of HIV increases his risk of opportunistic infections and complications, particularly if his immune system is compromised.
6. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety is a concern, as it can exacerbate his underlying medical conditions and increase his risk of further complications.
7. Macrocytic anemia: The patient's macrocytic anemia is likely secondary to EtOH use and may increase his risk of further complications, such as bleeding or infection.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further decompensation and complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old man with HIV, aortic stenosis, and CAD who presented with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events. He is currently in the ICU awaiting AVR surgery.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, and blood pressure of 94/62 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 22 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.

The patient has a history of transaminitis, which is trending downwards, and his liver function tests (LFTs) are being monitored daily. He has also been experiencing hyponatremia, which is likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH response. His sodium levels are being monitored daily.

The patient has a history of CAD, and his cardiac catheterization showed clean coronaries with no evidence of stenosis. He has been prescribed aspirin 81 mg daily and has been advised to hold atorvastatin and lisinopril due to elevated LFTs and critical aortic stenosis, respectively.

The patient has a history of HIV, with a CD4 count of 532 on [**2163-4-6**]. He was advised to hold HAART therapy until after cardiac surgery.

The patient's fluid balance is +160 mL, and his creatinine levels are stable at 1.3 mg/dL. His blood pressure is being monitored closely, and he is being diuresed as much as tolerated before surgery.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient has critical aortic stenosis, and the upcoming AVR surgery may be complicated by cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of CAD and may experience respiratory complications during and after surgery, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
3. Renal complications: The patient has hyponatremia and may experience worsening renal function during and after surgery, potentially leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Hepatic complications: The patient has transaminitis and may experience worsening liver function during and after surgery, potentially leading to liver failure or hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Infection complications: The patient has a history of HIV and may be at risk for opportunistic infections during and after surgery, potentially leading to sepsis or septic shock.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving heparin prophylaxis and may be at risk for bleeding complications during and after surgery.
7. Anesthesia complications: The patient has a history of CAD and may be at risk for anesthesia-related complications during and after surgery, potentially leading to respiratory or cardiac arrest.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various medical complications during and after surgery, and close monitoring and management are essential to prevent and treat these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis resolving, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this Wednesday.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +165mL, and past 12 hours -160mL; total
   -5mL, not at goal of -500cc, with a mild creatinine increase at 1.4
   from 1.3.
   - CT surgery following,  will assess if patient stable for surgery
   today.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, resume diuresis with Lasix IV/PO
   as tolerated by blood pressure, goal of even to -500ccs today.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Continues to trend downwards.  Hepatitis serologies
   and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was
   negative.  ? EBV and HSV may have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic
   congestion.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Change ASA to 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 two days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 131, which has increased
   steadily since [**6-30**], now stable for two days.  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.5L length of stay. Goal now even to slightly negative.
   .
   #Anxiety:
   - Will start 0.5mg PO Ativan
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # Coagulation.- VitK on Friday, [**2163-7-1**]. INR now 1.4

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old man with a complex medical history, including HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted with cardiogenic shock and critical aortic stenosis, awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery.

Current Status:

* The patient's fluid balance is still not at goal, with a total fluid input of 860 mL and output of 700 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 160 mL.
* His creatinine level has increased to 1.4 mg/dL, and his blood pressure is 94/62 mmHg.
* The patient's cardiac index is 1.1, and he is still waiting for AVR surgery, which is likely to occur on Wednesday.
* His liver function tests (LFTs) are trending downwards, and he is being monitored for signs of liver congestion.
* The patient is experiencing anxiety, which is being managed with Ativan 0.5mg PO q8h prn.
* His macrocytic anemia is likely secondary to ethanol use, and he is being treated with folate and thiamine.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's critical aortic stenosis and cardiogenic shock make him at risk for cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, or worsening heart failure.
* Liver complications: The patient's transaminitis and liver congestion could lead to liver failure or worsening liver function.
* Renal complications: The patient's increased creatinine level and positive fluid balance put him at risk for acute kidney injury or worsening kidney function.
* Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central venous lines and urinary catheters increase his risk for infection.
* Anxiety and stress: The patient's anxiety and stress could exacerbate his underlying medical conditions and lead to complications.

Assessment and Plan:

* The patient's fluid balance and creatinine level will be closely monitored to ensure that they are at goal.
* His LFTs and INR will continue to be monitored to ensure that his liver function is improving.
* The patient's anxiety will be managed with Ativan as needed.
* The patient will continue to be monitored for signs of liver congestion and cardiac complications.
* The patient's HAART therapy will be held until after cardiac surgery, as recommended by ID.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and complications. Close monitoring and management of his fluid balance, creatinine level, LFTs, and INR are essential to prevent complications and ensure a successful outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis resolving, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this Wednesday.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +165mL, and past 12 hours -160mL; total
   -5mL, with a creatinine of 1.3, Stable from yesterday.
   - CT surgery following, will make decision today if patient is stable
   for surgery.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, attempt goal of even to -500ccs
   today; patient is still fluid overloaded, but based on BUN/Cr, do not
   over-diurese. Continue fluid restriction of 1.5L.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Enzymes slightly from yesterday ALT (591 -> 578)AST
   (473 -> 585) Tbili (1.8 -> 2.0), and INR  stable at 1.4. All
   essentially stable for now, although concern for increasing
   decompenstation.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion plus significant
   alcohol ingestion prior to admission.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 127 today, down from 131
   yesterday, but has increased from 124 since [**6-29**].  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction
Hypervolemic hyponatremia
    - In order to correct Na levels, diuresis is needed. Given patient
   poor renal function, will hold for now. Will encourage CT surgery to
   perform surgery soon as concern for decompensation mounting.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.3L length of stay. Goal met: even to slightly negative.
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 three days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
    ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   #Anxiety: Improved with Ativan
   - Continue 0.5mg PO Ativan prn
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient has been optomized in terms of
   maximal diuresis, transaminitis resolving, INR 1.4. The patient has a
   history of aortic stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve
   placement in [**2155**].  Now with severe, progressive dyspnea and two
   syncopal episodes.  Found to have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a
   cardiac index of 1.1, waiting now for AVR, likely this Wednesday.
   Yesterday, fluid balance was +165mL, and past 12 hours -160mL; total
   -5mL, with a creatinine of 1.3, Stable from yesterday.
   - CT surgery following, will make decision today if patient is stable
   for surgery.
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - Off lasix for now [**1-24**] hypotension, attempt goal of even to -500ccs
   today; patient is still fluid overloaded, but based on BUN/Cr, do not
   over-diurese. Continue fluid restriction of 1.5L.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Enzymes slightly from yesterday ALT (591 -> 578)AST
   (473 -> 585) Tbili (1.8 -> 2.0), and INR  stable at 1.4. All
   essentially stable for now, although concern for increasing
   decompenstation.  Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and
   SM Ab were negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may
   have been ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion plus significant
   alcohol ingestion prior to admission.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 127 today, down from 131
   yesterday, but has increased from 124 since [**6-29**].  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction
Hypervolemic hyponatremia
    - In order to correct Na levels, diuresis is needed. Given patient
   poor renal function, will hold for now. Will encourage CT surgery to
   perform surgery soon as concern for decompensation mounting.
    - Continue to follow Na daily
    - Pt is now -1.3L length of stay. Goal met: even to slightly negative.
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr did bump to 1.4 three days ago, now at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix gtt
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
    ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   #Anxiety: Improved with Ativan
   - Continue 0.5mg PO Ativan prn
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # Coagulation.- VitK on Friday, [**2163-7-1**]. INR now 1.4

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3, which can lead to cardiogenic shock, heart failure, and decreased cardiac output.
	* CAD with a history of DES to the LAD, which can increase the risk of cardiac events, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory complications:
	* Pulmonary edema due to fluid overload, which can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
	* Crackles at bilateral bases, which can indicate early signs of pulmonary congestion.
3. Renal complications:
	* Hyponatremia, which can worsen if diuresis is not effective, leading to increased risk of seizures, brain edema, and cardiac arrhythmias.
	* Elevated creatinine levels, which can indicate kidney damage or decreased renal function.
4. Hepatic complications:
	* Transaminitis, which can indicate liver damage or inflammation, and may be related to HIV, hepatitis, or other underlying conditions.
	* Elevated liver enzymes, which can indicate liver dysfunction or damage.
5. Infectious complications:
	* HIV, which can increase the risk of opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia or cryptococcal meningitis.
	* Unknown allergies, which can increase the risk of adverse reactions to medications or other substances.
6. Neurological complications:
	* Syncope, which can be a sign of cardiac or neurological disorders, and may increase the risk of falls or other injuries.
	* Anxiety, which can worsen with increased stress or anxiety, and may require further management with medications or other interventions.
7. Hematological complications:
	* Macrocytic anemia, which can be caused by EtOH use, vitamin deficiencies, or other underlying conditions, and may increase the risk of bleeding or other complications.
8. Coagulation complications:
	* Elevated INR, which can increase the risk of bleeding or hemorrhage.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to prevent further deterioration and ensure optimal outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient currently scheduled for CT surgery
   today.  He has been medically optimized in terms of maximal diuresis,
   transaminitis stable, INR 1.4. The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.1, waiting
   now for AVR today.  Yesterday, fluid balance was -75mL, and past 12
   hours -250mL, with a creatinine of 1.3, stable from yesterday.
    - CT surgery following, plans to take patient for AVR today
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - In order to fully optimize for surgery, will give 250cc NS bolus
   this morning to correct low Na level.
    - Recheck Na in one hour
    - Continue fluid restriction of 1.5L.
   .
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 123 today, down from 127
   yesterday (131 the day before) (was 124 on [**6-29**]).  His hyponatremia is
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction.  Feel that it is hypervolemic
   hyponatremia, which typically responds to fluid restriction and
   diuresis.
    - In order to acutely correct Na levels, will give very small bolus of
   250cc NS at this time and then recheck Na level.
    - Will encourage CT surgery to proceed with surgery today as concern
   for decompensation mounting.
    - Continue to follow Na closely
    - I/O -75ml over last 24 hours. Goal met: even to slightly negative.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Enzymes slightly up from yesterday ALT (578
713) AST
   (585

   Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM Ab were
   negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may have been
   ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion plus significant alcohol
   ingestion prior to admission.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr stable at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient currently scheduled for CT surgery
   today.  He has been medically optimized in terms of maximal diuresis,
   transaminitis stable, INR 1.4. The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.1, waiting
   now for AVR today.  Yesterday, fluid balance was -75mL, and past 12
   hours -250mL, with a creatinine of 1.3, stable from yesterday.
    - CT surgery following, plans to take patient for AVR today
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - In order to fully optimize for surgery, will give 250cc NS bolus
   this morning to correct low Na level.
    - Recheck Na in one hour
    - Continue fluid restriction of 1.5L.

   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 123 today, down from 127
   yesterday (131 the day before) (was 124 on [**6-29**]).  His hyponatremia is
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction.  Feel that it is hypervolemic
   hyponatremia, which typically responds to fluid restriction and
   diuresis.
    - In order to acutely correct Na levels, will give very small bolus of
   250cc NS at this time and then recheck Na level.
    - Will encourage CT surgery to proceed with surgery today as concern
   for decompensation mounting.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease (CAD). He presented with progressive dyspnea and two syncopal events, leading to cardiogenic shock with a cardiac index of 1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.3. He has been medically optimized and is awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (96.9°F)
* Heart rate: 92 bpm (92-106 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 82/61 mmHg (66-103/79-88 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute (15-28 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 99% (room air)

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient's condition is critical, and AVR surgery is scheduled for today. However, his sodium level is low (123 mmol/L), and he has a history of transaminitis.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is low, which may be secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) response, rather than liver dysfunction. Fluid restriction and diuresis may help correct this condition.
3. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are slightly elevated, which may be a sign of increasing decompenstation. Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, and tox screen was negative.
4. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, which may be contributing to his cardiogenic shock.
5. PUMP/Chronic Decompensated Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has elevated filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No pulmonary edema is present on CXR or exam.
6. RHYTHM: The patient is in normal sinus rhythm (NSR), which is being monitored on telemetry.
7. HIV: The patient has a history of HIV, and his CD4 count is 532. ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart HAART therapy, and they recommended holding therapy until after cardiac surgery.
8. Macrocytic Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to EtOH use, and he was started on Folate and Thiamine on admission.

Potential complications that may arise during AVR surgery include:

1. Cardiac tamponade
2. Pulmonary edema
3. Renal failure
4. Neurological complications
5. Sepsis

To mitigate these risks, the patient will receive a 250cc normal saline bolus to correct his low sodium level, and his fluid balance will be closely monitored. He will also receive a small dose of Ativan for anxiety and continue on a regular diet with salt and fluid restriction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient currently scheduled for CT surgery
   today.  He has been medically optimized in terms of maximal diuresis,
   transaminitis stable, INR 1.4. The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.1, waiting
   now for AVR today.  Yesterday, fluid balance was -75mL, and past 12
   hours -250mL, with a creatinine of 1.3, stable from yesterday.
    - CT surgery following, plans to take patient for AVR today
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - In order to fully optimize for surgery, will give 250cc NS bolus
   this morning to correct low Na level.
    - Recheck Na in one hour
    - Continue fluid restriction of 1.5L.
   .
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 123 today, down from 127
   yesterday (131 the day before) (was 124 on [**6-29**]).  His hyponatremia is
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction.  Feel that it is hypervolemic
   hyponatremia, which typically responds to fluid restriction and
   diuresis.
    - In order to acutely correct Na levels, will give very small bolus of
   250cc NS at this time and then recheck Na level.
    - Will encourage CT surgery to proceed with surgery today as concern
   for decompensation mounting.
    - Continue to follow Na closely
    - I/O -75ml over last 24 hours. Goal met: even to slightly negative.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Enzymes slightly up from yesterday ALT (578
713) AST
   (585
792) Tbili (2.0
2.1), and INR (1.4
1.5). Concerning for increasing
   decompenstation with low increases over the last several days.
   Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM Ab were
   negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may have been
   ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion plus significant alcohol
   ingestion prior to admission.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr stable at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   #Anxiety: Improved with Ativan
   - Continue 0.5mg PO Ativan prn
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.
   # Coagulation: VitK on Friday, [**2163-7-1**]. INR now 1.5

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old man with HIV, aortic stenosis, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who is awaiting aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgery. He has been medically optimized with maximal diuresis, transaminitis is stable, and his international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.4.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Moderate crackles at both lung bases, no wheezes or rhonchi
* Cardiac: Sinus rhythm, loud systolic murmur radiating to the carotids, faint diastolic murmur at the left sternal border, and a cardiac index of 1.1
* Hemodynamic: BP 82/61 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, and SpO2 99% RA
* Fluid balance: -75 mL over the last 24 hours, and -250 mL over the past 12 hours
* Laboratory results: Sodium 123 mmol/L, potassium 4.3 mmol/L, creatinine 1.3 mg/dL, and albumin 3.6 g/dL

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Critical aortic stenosis: The patient's aortic valve area is 0.3, and his cardiac index is 1.1, which may lead to cardiogenic shock and death if not treated promptly.
2. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is 123 mmol/L, which may be due to poor forward renal flow and appropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) response or liver dysfunction. This may lead to seizures, coma, and death if not treated promptly.
3. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are slightly elevated, which may be due to hepatic congestion, significant alcohol ingestion, or other causes. This may lead to liver failure and death if not treated promptly.
4. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, and his cardiac catheterization showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis. However, he may still be at risk for cardiac complications during and after surgery.
5. PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: The patient's elevated filling pressures and chronic diastolic heart failure may lead to cardiogenic shock and death if not treated promptly.
6. HIV: The patient has a history of HIV, and his CD4 count is 532. He is being held on HAART therapy until after cardiac surgery, which may lead to a higher risk of opportunistic infections and death.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, the following plan is recommended:

1. Proceed with AVR surgery today as planned.
2. Continue fluid restriction of 1.5 L/day to correct hyponatremia.
3. Monitor the patient's sodium level closely and adjust fluid management as needed.
4. Continue to hold HAART therapy until after cardiac surgery.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's liver enzymes and adjust therapy as needed.
6. Continue to manage the patient's CAD with ASA 81 mg daily and hold Atorvastatin and Lisinopril until after surgery.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust therapy as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust therapy as needed.
9. Continue to provide prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer.
10. Continue to communicate with the patient and his partner regarding his condition and treatment plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 44 yo man with HIV, Aortic stenosis s/p porcine valve
   replacement in [**2155**], and CAD, who presented with progressive dyspnea
   and two syncopal events and was found to have cardiogenic shock with CI
   1.1 and critical aortic stenosis with valve area of 0.3 diuresed as
   much as tolerated awaiting AVR.
   .
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis: Patient currently scheduled for CT surgery
   today.  He has been medically optimized in terms of maximal diuresis,
   transaminitis stable, INR 1.4. The patient has a history of aortic
   stenosis [**1-24**] bicuspid valve, s/p porcine valve placement in [**2155**].  Now
   with severe, progressive dyspnea and two syncopal episodes.  Found to
   have an aortic valve area of 0.3 and a cardiac index of 1.1, waiting
   now for AVR today.  Yesterday, fluid balance was -75mL, and past 12
   hours -250mL; total -5mL, with a creatinine of 1.3, stable from
   yesterday.
    - CT surgery following, plans to take patient for AVR today
    - Pre-op Carotid U/S showed no carotid stenosis.
    - Cleared by hepatology and ID.
    - In order to fully optimize for surgery, will give 250cc NS bolus
   this morning to correct low Na level.
    - Recheck Na in one hour
    - Continue fluid restriction of 1.5L.
   .
   #  Hyponatremia: The patient's Na today is 123 today, down from 127
   yesterday (131 the day before) (was 124 on [**6-29**]).  His hyponatremia was
   likely secondary to poor forward renal flow and appropriate ADH
   response v. liver dysfunction
Hypervolemic hyponatremia
    - In order to acutely correct Na levels, will give very small bolus of
   250cc NS at this time and then recheck Na level.
    - Will encourage CT surgery to proceed with surgery today as concern
   for decompensation mounting.
    - Continue to follow Na closely
    - I/O -75ml over last 24 hours. Goal met: even to slightly negative.
   .
   # Transaminitis:  Enzymes slightly from yesterday ALT (578
713) AST
   (585

   decompenstation with very low increases over the last several days.
   Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and SM Ab were
   negative, and tox screen was negative.  ? EBV and HSV may have been
   ordered.   Most likely hepatic congestion plus significant alcohol
   ingestion prior to admission.
    - Continue to trend LFTs and INR daily
    - Continue to hold HAART medications
   .
   #. CAD:  The patient has a history of CAD, s/p DES to the LAD.  Cardiac
   cath showed clean coronaries and no evidence of stenosis.
    - Continue ASA 81 mg daily
    - Continue to hold Atorvastatin in the setting of elevated LFTs
    - Continue to hold Lisinopril in the setting of critical aortic
   stenosis.
   .
   # PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure/cardiogenic shock: Elevated
   filling pressures, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No
   pulmonary edema on CXR or exam. [**Month (only) 60**] have diuresed as much as will be
   tolerated before surgery.
   - Cr stable at 1.3.
   - Continue to hold Lasix
   .
   # RHYTHM:  The patient continues to be in NSR.  Continue to monitor on
   telemetery.
   .
   #. HIV:  The patient has a history of HIV, with CD4 of 532 on [**2163-4-6**].
   ID was consulted regarding guidance on when to restart the patient's
   HAART therapy. They recommend holding HAART therapy until after cardiac
   surgery [**1-24**] liver function.
    - Appreciate ID recs
   .
   #Anxiety: Improved with Ativan
   - Continue 0.5mg PO Ativan prn
   .
   #. Macrocytic Anemia:  Likely secondary to EtOH use.  The patient was
   started on Folate and Thiamine on this admission.
   - Continue Folate and thiamine.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old man with a complex medical history, including HIV, aortic stenosis, and CAD. He is currently in the ICU awaiting AVR surgery. The note highlights several key concerns:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels have decreased from 127 to 123, and his fluid balance is negative (-75mL over the past 24 hours). To correct this, a 250cc NS bolus will be given, and Na levels will be rechecked in one hour.
2. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes (ALT and AST) have increased slightly, but his INR remains stable at 1.5. Hepatitis serologies and CMV were negative, and the most likely cause is hepatic congestion plus significant alcohol ingestion prior to admission.
3. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's cardiac index is 1.1, and he has been medically optimized for surgery. He has a history of CAD and aortic stenosis.
4. PUMP/Chronic decompensated heart failure: The patient's filling pressures are elevated, but diastolic HF is chronic and compensated. No pulmonary edema is present on CXR or exam.
5. Rhythm: The patient remains in NSR, and telemetry monitoring will continue.
6. HIV: The patient's CD4 count is 532, and ID consultation recommends holding HAART therapy until after cardiac surgery due to liver function concerns.
7. Macrocytic anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to EtOH use, and he has been started on Folate and Thiamine.
8. Coagulation: The patient's INR is 1.5, and VitK was given on Friday.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac index is 1.1, and he is awaiting AVR surgery. There is a risk of cardiac complications during and after surgery.
2. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine is stable at 1.3, but there is a risk of worsening renal function due to fluid restriction and cardiac surgery.
3. Liver complications: The patient's liver enzymes are slightly elevated, and there is a risk of worsening liver function due to ongoing inflammation and cardiac surgery.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of CAD and aortic stenosis, which may increase his risk of respiratory complications during and after surgery.
5. Infectious complications: The patient has HIV and is awaiting cardiac surgery, which may increase his risk of infectious complications.

Given the patient's complex medical history and ongoing medical concerns, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of his condition to prevent potential complications and ensure a successful outcome."
