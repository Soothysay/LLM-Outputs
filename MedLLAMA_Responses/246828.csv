You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient underwent a bronchoscopy on [**2183-4-24**] 10:47 AM, which resulted in removal of mucus plugs, lung reexpansion, and improved mental status. The patient's INR was elevated, and 5mg of vitamin K was administered. The patient received 1L of normal saline due to net negative fluid balance. The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 117 bpm, and blood pressure of 111/51 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 93% on a face tent.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 308 K/uL. The patient's creatinine is 0.7 mg/dL, and troponin-T is <0.01. The patient's imaging studies show marked improvement in aeration of the left lung, with bulky lymphadenopathy and small left apical pneumothorax.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and small left apical pneumothorax may indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Pneumothorax expansion: The small left apical pneumothorax may expand and compromise lung function if not managed properly.
3. Reexpansion edema: The patient's recent lung collapse and reexpansion may lead to reexpansion edema, which can cause respiratory distress.
4. Infection: The patient's bulky lymphadenopathy and mediastinal involvement may indicate an underlying infection, which could progress and compromise the patient's respiratory status.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and need for vitamin K administration may indicate a coagulopathy, which could increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Fluid overload: The patient's net negative fluid balance and need for normal saline administration may indicate a risk of fluid overload, which could compromise respiratory function.
7. Stress ulceration: The patient's ICU stay and potential for gastrointestinal bleeding may indicate a risk of stress ulceration, which could lead to complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation."

 HYPOXEMIA
   57 yo F with metastatic renal cell carcinoma w/ known mets to skull,
   mediastinum, lungs, hip; 3 days post-op from radical left nephrectomy
   with chest tube placement (subsequent PTX) develops tachycardia with
   new diffuse opacity over entire left lung field.
   .
   1. Hypoxia/ New diffuse L lung opacity: Pt without baseline O2
   requirement at home. Prior to current event involing tachycardia, she
   had already be intermittently desating to high 70s with a productive
   cough.  Mucus plugging high on differential as her sat seems to improve
   with coughing and chest PT. New diffuse lung opacity concerning for
   # mucus plugging  decreased ability to clear airways since y-stent
   placement
   -- bronchoscopy this morning by IP; if findings not suggestive, may
   pursue CTA
   -- no empiric anticoagulation for PE given recent surgery and bleeding
   also on differential
   -- serial CXR
   -- Q6h Hct
   2 Elevated INR
   .
   2. Tachycardia: most likely sinus, but P wave axis has changed possibly
   suggesting atrial tacycardia. Rate reduced priot to transfer with
   lopressor IV 5mg x 1. If lung process displacing heart, could affect
   p-axis?
   -- repeat 12-lead

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who underwent radical left nephrectomy with chest tube placement. She developed tachycardia with new diffuse opacity over the entire left lung field.

The patient's vital signs include:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
* Heart rate: 117 bpm (93-127 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 111/51 mmHg (65/18-153/112 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute (13-44 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 93%

The patient's laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 10.0 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 308 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 107 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results: see below

The patient's imaging results include:

* CXR: Marked improvement in aeration of the left lung, bulky lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum and both hila, and a small left apical pneumothorax.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypoxemia: The patient is being treated for hypoxemia with oxygen therapy and is being monitored for further improvement.
* Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is being treated with lopressor IV and is being monitored for further improvement.
* Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: The patient is being treated with chemotherapy and is being monitored for further response.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia is being treated with blood transfusions and is being monitored for further improvement.
* Right hip metastasis: The patient is being treated with non-weight bearing status and is being monitored for further improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and tachycardia can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension can lead to cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
* Bleeding complications: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia can lead to bleeding complications if not properly managed.
* Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state can lead to infection if not properly managed.
* Metastatic spread: The patient's metastatic renal cell carcinoma can spread to other parts of the body if not properly managed."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, who underwent radical left nephrectomy with chest tube placement, and has a history of mucus plugging/hypoxia.

Key findings:

1. The patient's mental status has improved over the course of the day.
2. INR is elevated (2.2, 2.6 on repeat), which responded partially to 5mg vitamin K and received another 10mg vitamin K today.
3. The patient has tachycardia (117 bpm) with a normal P wave axis on repeat EKG, which is likely due to [**1-13**] volume depletion and improved after a 2L NS bolus.
4. The patient has anemia (Hct 30) due to intra-op losses and received two units of blood in the OR.
5. The patient has a small apical pneumothorax (PTX) on the left side, which was not treated with a chest tube.
6. The patient has bulky lymphadenopathy within the mediastinum and both hila on CXR.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure due to mucus plugging/hypoxia and potential reexpansion edema.
2. Bleeding complications due to elevated INR and potential coagulopathy.
3. Infection (VAP) due to prolonged ICU stay and respiratory support.
4. DVT due to immobility and potential coagulopathy.
5. Anemia worsening due to ongoing blood loss and inadequate nutrition.
6. Pneumothorax worsening or recurrence due to lack of treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue respiratory support with levalbuterol, ipratropium, and acetylcysteine nebs, and monitor for signs of respiratory failure.
2. Monitor INR closely and consider nutrition consult to address potential malnutrition.
3. Continue tachycardia monitoring and consider repeat Hct given recent surgery.
4. Monitor Hct closely and consider blood transfusions if necessary.
5. Consider DVT prophylaxis despite elevated INR.
6. Monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotics as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor for signs of anemia and consider blood transfusions if necessary.
8. Consider prophylactic antibiotics for the patient's small apical PTX on the left side.
9. Monitor for signs of pneumothorax worsening or recurrence and consider treatment if necessary."

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 612**] has responded to 2 L NS on account of recent tachycardia.
   She continues to bring up thick secretions with nebs. chest PT and
   hydration. She denies severe pain.
   Exam notable for Tm 100.1 BP  107/48 HR of 100 RR of 20 with sats of
   97% on face tent O2 . she has decreased air entry at left base with
   dullness/ egophony. She has scattered exp wheezing in right lung.
    Labs notable for WBC 8.3 K, HCT 26.7 , K+ 4.2, Cr  0.5 ,  CXR with
   decreasing pleural effusion on left ( still moderate)
   Agree with plan to provide aggressive bronchopulmonary assistance with
   secretions. [**Month (only) 51**] need antibiotics if sputum GS shows increasing polys or
   clincial features of infection . She will need to get OOB to chair/
   possibly ambulate with help.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is stable for transfer to medical floor.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 HYPOXEMIA
   57 yo F with metastatic renal cell carcinoma w/ known mets to skull,
   mediastinum, lungs, hip; 3 days post-op from radical left nephrectomy
   with chest tube placement (subsequent PTX) develops tachycardia with
   new diffuse opacity over entire left lung field secondary to mucus
   plugging which improved dramatically with bronch and mucolytics.
   .
   1. Hypoxia/ Mucus Plugging: Pt without baseline O2 requirement at home.
   Mucus plugging/ hypoxia improved dramatically with bronch and
   mucolytics. Repeat CXR showed aeration of left lung field.
   -- daily CXR
   -- continue levalbuterol, ipratropium, acetylcysteine nebs, convert to
   standing
   -- send sputum culture
   --acappella valve for increased clearance of mucus
   -- daily chest PT
   2 Elevated INR: Unusual as pt does not appear markedly malnourished.
   Most recent INR from a few weeks ago, so chronicity is unclear. LFTs
   unremarkable. Respnded partially to 5mg Vit K and received another 10mg
   Vit K today with INR down to 1.4. Alb=3.2
   -- trend INR
   -- consider nutrition consult
   .
   2. Tachycardia: sinus, P wave axis normal on repeat EKG, previously
   concerned for atrial tach, but now appears to be sinus.
   -- likely [**1-13**] volume depletion and improved s/p 2L NS bolus
   3. Metastastic Renal CA: S/P left nephrectomy, plan is for
   chemotherapy.
   -- f/u urology recs
   .
   4. Anemia: Pt s/p two units of blood given in OR for intra-op losses.
   Hct stable at 30 since then--approximately outpt baseline
   - decreased to 27 s/p 2L, likely dilutional, would recheck PM Hct
   - monitor Hct as above
   .
   5. Right hip metastasis: precvously decribed as non-weight bearing per
   pt history, this does not seem to be correct; pt has been ambulating
   with walker until this admission

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 612**] has responded to 2 L NS on account of recent tachycardia.
   She continues to bring up thick secretions with nebs. chest PT and
   hydration. She denies severe pain.
   Exam notable for Tm 100.1 BP  107/48 HR of 100 RR of 20 with sats of
   97% on face tent O2 . she has decreased air entry at left base with
   dullness/ egophony. She has scattered exp wheezing in right lung.
    Labs notable for WBC 8.3 K, HCT 26.7 , K+ 4.2, Cr  0.5 ,  CXR with
   decreasing pleural effusion on left ( still moderate)
   Agree with plan to provide aggressive bronchopulmonary assistance with
   secretions. [**Month (only) 51**] need antibiotics if sputum GS shows increasing polys or
   clincial features of infection . She will need to get OOB to chair/
   possibly ambulate with help.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is stable for transfer to medical floor.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who has undergone a radical left nephrectomy and has a history of metastases to the skull, mediastinum, lungs, and hip. She is currently admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of hypoxemia secondary to mucus plugging and has been treated with bronch and mucolytics.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 91 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 115/60 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99% on a face tent. She has a normal sinus rhythm and a normal axis on her electrocardiogram.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.3 K/μL, a hemoglobin level of 26.7 g/dL, and a platelet count of 104 K/μL. Her creatinine level is 0.5 mg/dL, and her troponin-T level is less than 0.01 ng/mL. Her liver function tests are normal, and her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies show a complete left lower lobe collapse on a chest X-ray, with a slightly increased lung volume and a tiny left apical pneumothorax. Her lymphadenopathy is unchanged.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Hypoxia/mucus plugging: The patient's hypoxia has improved dramatically with bronch and mucolytics. She will continue to receive levalbuterol, ipratropium, and acetylcysteine nebs, and will be converted to standing nebs. She will also receive an acappella valve for increased clearance of mucus, and will undergo daily chest physical therapy.
2. Elevated INR: The patient's INR is elevated, but she does not appear to be markedly malnourished. Her liver function tests are normal, and she has responded partially to vitamin K. She will continue to receive vitamin K, and her INR will be trended.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely secondary to volume depletion, which has improved with a 2L normal saline bolus.
4. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: The patient's plan is for chemotherapy, and she will follow up with her urologist's recommendations.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable, and she will continue to receive blood transfusions as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia can worsen and lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory secretions can become infected, leading to pneumonia.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient's pleural effusion can worsen and lead to respiratory distress.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia can worsen and lead to cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation.
5. Infection: The patient's metastatic renal cell carcinoma can lead to infection, particularly if the patient's immune system is compromised.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOXEMIA
   57 yo F with metastatic renal cell carcinoma w/ known mets to skull,
   mediastinum, lungs, hip; 3 days post-op from radical left nephrectomy
   with chest tube placement (subsequent PTX) develops tachycardia with
   new diffuse opacity over entire left lung field secondary to mucus
   plugging which improved dramatically with bronch and mucolytics.
   .
   1. Hypoxia/ Mucus Plugging: Pt without baseline O2 requirement at home.
   Mucus plugging/ hypoxia improved dramatically with bronch and
   mucolytics. Repeat CXR showed aeration of left lung field.
   -- daily CXR
   -- continue levalbuterol, ipratropium, acetylcysteine nebs, convert to
   standing
   -- send sputum culture
   --acappella valve for increased clearance of mucus
   -- daily chest PT
   2 Elevated INR: Unusual as pt does not appear markedly malnourished.
   Most recent INR from a few weeks ago, so chronicity is unclear. LFTs
   unremarkable. Respnded partially to 5mg Vit K and received another 10mg
   Vit K today with INR down to 1.4. Alb=3.2
   -- trend INR
   -- consider nutrition consult
   .
   2. Tachycardia: sinus, P wave axis normal on repeat EKG, previously
   concerned for atrial tach, but now appears to be sinus.
   -- likely [**1-13**] volume depletion and improved s/p 2L NS bolus
   3. Metastastic Renal CA: S/P left nephrectomy, plan is for
   chemotherapy.
   -- f/u urology recs
   .
   4. Anemia: Pt s/p two units of blood given in OR for intra-op losses.
   Hct stable at 30 since then--approximately outpt baseline
   - decreased to 27 s/p 2L, likely dilutional, would recheck PM Hct
   - monitor Hct as above
   .
   5. Right hip metastasis: precvously decribed as non-weight bearing per
   pt history, this does not seem to be correct; pt has been ambulating
   with walker until this admission

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, known to have mets to the skull, mediastinum, lungs, and hip. She underwent radical left nephrectomy with chest tube placement and developed tachycardia with new diffuse opacity over the entire left lung field secondary to mucus plugging.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.8°C (100.1°F)
* Heart rate: 91 bpm (sinus rhythm)
* Blood pressure: 115/60 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.0-12.2 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.3-8.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 26.7-31.3 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.5-0.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 77-107 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray (CXR) showing complete left lower lobe collapse, slightly increased lung volume, and a tiny left apical pneumothorax.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 99%, but she has a history of mucus plugging and has been treated with bronch and mucolytics.
* Mucus plugging: The patient's CXR shows aeration of the left lung field, but she may still be at risk for further mucus plugging.
* Elevated INR: The patient's INR is 1.4, which is slightly elevated. She has been treated with vitamin K and her INR has decreased.
* Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is 91 bpm, which is slightly elevated. She has been treated with a 2L NS bolus and her heart rate has improved.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin is 8.3-8.9 g/dL, which is slightly low. She has received two units of blood and her hemoglobin has stabilized.
* Right hip metastasis: The patient has a history of right hip metastasis, which may affect her mobility and ability to ambulate.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's history of mucus plugging and hypoxemia may put her at risk for respiratory failure.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and elevated INR may put her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
* Infection: The patient's history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and her current condition may put her at risk for infection.
* Bleeding: The patient's history of anemia and her current condition may put her at risk for bleeding.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Daily CXR to monitor for further mucus plugging
* Continue levalbuterol, ipratropium, and acetylcysteine nebs
* Send sputum culture
* Acappella valve for increased clearance of mucus
* Daily chest PT
* Trend INR
* Consider nutrition consult
* Monitor Hct
* F/u urology recs"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Pleural effusion: The patient has a left pleural effusion, which may be contributing to respiratory distress.
* DVT: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility and the presence of central lines.
* Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to prolonged ICU stay and the presence of central lines.
* VAP: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
* Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient is receiving heparin, which may cause HIT.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan should be implemented:

* Continue oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen saturation above 95%.
* Monitor the patient's volume status and adjust fluid management accordingly.
* Consider placing the patient on a ventilator to improve oxygenation.
* Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medication accordingly.
* Consider placing the patient on anticoagulation therapy to prevent DVT.
* Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust medication accordingly to prevent stress ulcer.
* Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy accordingly to prevent VAP.
* Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust heparin therapy accordingly to prevent HIT."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old female with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, who underwent radical left nephrectomy with chest tube placement (subsequent pneumothorax) three days ago. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to tachycardia, hypoxia, and mucus plugging.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 91 bpm (normal range: 82-122 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 115/60 mmHg (normal range: 107/48-139/75 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 18 inspirations per minute (normal range: 13-25 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 99% (normal range: 95-100%)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 10.0 (normal range: 4.5-11.0)
* Hemoglobin: 8.9 g/dL (normal range: 12.0-16.0 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 306 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 90 mg/dL (normal range: 10-25 mg/dL)
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Glucose: 107 mg/dL (normal range: 70-110 mg/dL)

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: complete left lower lobe collapse, slightly increased; left pleural effusion is likely unchanged; left apical pneumothorax is very tiny; lymphadenopathy is unchanged.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and mucus plugging can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal laboratory results may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
3. Bleeding: The patient's low platelet count and abnormal coagulation studies may increase the risk of bleeding, especially with invasive procedures or trauma.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels may indicate kidney dysfunction, which can lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
5. Metastatic disease progression: The patient's metastatic renal cell carcinoma may progress and spread to other parts of the body, leading to worsening symptoms and reduced quality of life.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Daily chest X-ray to monitor lung aeration and pleural effusion.
2. Continue levalbuterol, ipratropium, and acetylcysteine nebulizations to manage bronchospasm and mucus plugging.
3. Continue chest physical therapy to promote lung expansion and drainage.
4. Trend the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) to monitor for bleeding risk and consider nutrition consult to address potential malnutrition.
5. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin and platelet count to assess for anemia and bleeding risk.
6. Plan for chemotherapy to manage metastatic renal cell carcinoma."
