   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Intubation was discussed with the patient and her family and she
   agreed to undergo intubation for a short period of time to get over her
   acute illness but stated that she would no want to be on a ventilator
   for a long period of time.
   - A femoral line was placed for access.
   - Found to have an NSTEMI. CK 159 -->139 --> 115  MB 12 --> 9 --> 7
   Trop 0.39 --> 0.38 --> 0.37
   - Given 5 mg IV lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the
   130's.  She was started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an
   A-line was placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given
   150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP
   dropped when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy
   to the 130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - Repeat evening Hct was 33.2 (from 35.4).
   - Her neo was weaned off overnight and she was started on a low-dose
   lasix gtt given her persistently low PaO2 to try to diurese her gently.
   This am she denies pain, shortness of breath, or other complaints.  No
   further episodes of bleeding.

   Assessment and Plan
   69F w/ h/o afib on coumadin, PUD, COPD, CKD, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia transferred from [**Hospital1 709**] by family request after presenting
   with black stools, developed hypoxemia and tachyarrhythmia with RVR,
   now with continued respiratory distress complicated by demand ischemia.
   # respiratory distress/COPD/PNA: The patient has a history of COPD,
   likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload. On
   High-flow over the day and last night.  ABG on arrival was 7.45/39/55
   and there was discussion about intubating her, however she was strongly
   against being intubated, even after it was explained that it would only
   be for a short amount of time.  Her family discussed the issue with
   her, but by the time she had agreed to undergo intubation, she had
   improved somewhat so she was continued on the high flow mask.  She was
   given 80 mg IV lasix x 1 for diuresis in the afternoon and over night
   started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR
   showed evdience of pulmonary edema.  There was also a question of an
   aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over
   next 24hrs.
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, atrovent nebs prn, xopenex
   nebs prn
   - Continue levo/flagyl for a possible aspiration PNA until her
   respiratory status is stable.
   # tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a h/o afib on coumadin although
   rhythm currently appears regular likely aflutter She was given 5 mg IV
   lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the 130's.  She was
   started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an A-line was
   placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given 150 mg IV
   bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP dropped
   when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy to the
   130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - Continue amiodarone loading and 200 mg of po amiodarone [**Hospital1 **].
   - Consider cards consult for better rate control.
   # NSTEMI: Likely secondary to demand from anemia, resp distress, and
   tachycardia. CK 159 -->139 --> 115  MB 12 --> 9 --> 7  Trop 0.39 -->
   0.38 --> 0.37.  Currently chest pain free.
   - trend CE, daily EKGs
   - once her HR is better controlled, consider checking a TTE
   - Continue 12.5 mg of metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] and her statin.
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
   # GIB: GI aware but patient not stable currently for endoscopy; given
   concurrent NSTEMI, risk:benefit ratio may favor endoscopy earlier, as
   definitively addressing bleeding may allow earlier
   anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy.  INR reversed at OSH, this am 1.3
   - Continue hold anticoagulation for now
   - continue Protonix IV
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - Hct has been stable
   # h/o CVA: on anticoagulation as outpatient but GIB currently precludes
   this
   - monitor neuro exam
   - hold anticoagulation due to recent GIB
   # hypertension: Her BP was elevated on admission likely from
   respiratory distress.  She was given metoprolol for rate control and
   loaded with amiodarone as above and her SBPs dropped to the point she
   required neo for a short period of time.
   -  Continue to monitor BP closely.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin
   # Depression: Continue citalopram
   # FEN: NPO, replete lytes prn
   # PPx: pneumoboots (no heparin given GIB), PPI
   # Code: Full, patient unsure but documented as Full code at OSH and
   discussed with family

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # respiratory distress/COPD/PNA: The patient has a history of COPD,
   likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload. On
   High-flow over the day and last night.  ABG on arrival was 7.45/39/55
   and there was discussion about intubating her, however she was strongly
   against being intubated, even after it was explained that it would only
   be for a short amount of time.  Her family discussed the issue with
   her, but by the time she had agreed to undergo intubation, she had
   improved somewhat so she was continued on the high flow mask.  She was
   given 80 mg IV lasix x 1 for diuresis in the afternoon and over night
   started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR
   showed evdience of pulmonary edema.  There was also a question of an
   aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, COPD, CKD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a previous CVA. She was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress, tachyarrhythmia, and a possible aspiration pneumonia. She was started on high-flow oxygen and a low-dose lasix drip for diuresis. Her tachyarrhythmia was managed with amiodarone and metoprolol. She also had a NSTEMI, which was likely secondary to demand ischemia. She was given 5 mg IV lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the 130's. She was started on an amiodarone drip and po amiodarone and an A-line was placed. She continued to be tachycardic and was then given 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone. She was also started on neo as her SBP dropped when the amiodarone was started.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is at risk for respiratory failure. She is on high-flow oxygen and a low-dose lasix drip for diuresis, but her PaO2 is persistently low.
2. Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient's tachyarrhythmia is not well-controlled, and she is at risk for cardiac arrhythmia. She is on amiodarone and metoprolol, but her HR remains in the 130's.
3. NSTEMI: The patient's NSTEMI is not well-controlled, and she is at risk for further cardiac complications. She is on metoprolol and a statin, but her CK and MB are still elevated.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and she is at risk for further bleeding. She is on proton pump inhibitors and is being monitored closely.
5. Hypotension: The patient's SBP has dropped, and she is at risk for hypotension. She is on neo and is being closely monitored.
6. Anemia: The patient's Hct is low, and she is at risk for anemia. She is being transfused with blood products, but her Hct is still low.
7. Renal failure: The patient's CKD is a risk factor for renal failure, and she is at risk for further decline in her renal function. She is being closely monitored for signs of renal failure.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's condition is unstable, and she is at risk for multiple medical complications. She requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, and gastrointestinal status. She should continue to receive high-flow oxygen and a low-dose lasix drip for diuresis. Her tachyarrhythmia should be managed with amiodarone and metoprolol, and her NSTEMI should be managed with metoprolol and a statin. She should be closely monitored for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypotension, anemia, and renal failure. A cardiology consult should be obtained for further management of her cardiac status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   69F w/ h/o afib on coumadin, PUD, COPD, CKD, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia transferred from [**Hospital1 709**] by family request after presenting
   with black stools, developed hypoxemia and tachyarrhythmia with RVR,
   now with continued respiratory distress complicated by demand ischemia.
   # respiratory distress/COPD/PNA: The patient has a history of COPD,
   likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload. On
   High-flow over the day and last night.  ABG on arrival was 7.45/39/55
   and there was discussion about intubating her, however she was strongly
   against being intubated, even after it was explained that it would only
   be for a short amount of time.  Her family discussed the issue with
   her, but by the time she had agreed to undergo intubation, she had
   improved somewhat so she was continued on the high flow mask.  She was
   given 80 mg IV lasix x 1 for diuresis in the afternoon and over night
   started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR
   showed evdience of pulmonary edema.  There was also a question of an
   aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over
   next 24hrs.
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, atrovent nebs prn, xopenex
   nebs prn
   - Continue levo/flagyl for a possible aspiration PNA until her
   respiratory status is stable.
   # tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a h/o afib on coumadin although
   rhythm currently appears regular likely aflutter She was given 5 mg IV
   lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the 130's.  She was
   started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an A-line was
   placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given 150 mg IV
   bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP dropped
   when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy to the
   130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - Continue amiodarone loading and 200 mg of po amiodarone [**Hospital1 **].
   - Consider cards consult for better rate control.
   # NSTEMI: Likely secondary to demand from anemia, resp distress, and
   tachycardia. CK 159 -->139 --> 115  MB 12 --> 9 --> 7  Trop 0.39 -->
   0.38 --> 0.37.  Currently chest pain free.
   - trend CE, daily EKGs
   - once her HR is better controlled, consider checking a TTE
   - Continue 12.5 mg of metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] and her statin.
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
   # GIB: GI aware but patient not stable currently for endoscopy; given
   concurrent NSTEMI, risk:benefit ratio may favor endoscopy earlier, as
   definitively addressing bleeding may allow earlier
   anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy.  INR reversed at OSH, this am 1.3
   - Continue hold anticoagulation for now
   - continue Protonix IV
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - Hct has been in the low 30
s and stable.  Can check another Hct in 8
   hrs and if stable, move to [**Hospital1 **] Hct checks.
   # h/o CVA: on anticoagulation as outpatient but GIB currently precludes
   this
   - monitor neuro exam
   - hold anticoagulation due to recent GIB
   # hypertension: Her BP was elevated on admission likely from
   respiratory distress.  She was given metoprolol for rate control and
   loaded with amiodarone as above and her SBPs dropped to the point she
   required neo for a short period of time.
   -  Continue to monitor BP closely.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, PUD, COPD, CKD, CVA, HTN, and hyperlipidemia, who was transferred from another hospital due to black stools, hypoxemia, and tachyarrhythmia. She was found to have an NSTEMI, likely secondary to demand from anemia, respiratory distress, and tachycardia. She was given amiodarone and metoprolol for rate control, and her SBP dropped, requiring neo for a short period. She was also started on a low-dose lasix gtt for diuresis due to pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is still unstable, and she may require intubation if she clinically deteriorates.
2. Tachyarrhythmia: The patient's tachycardia may persist despite treatment with amiodarone and metoprolol, and she may require further rate control measures.
3. NSTEMI: The patient's NSTEMI may progress if her underlying conditions are not adequately managed, and she may require further cardiac evaluation and treatment.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may worsen if she is not adequately managed, and she may require endoscopy and other interventions to control the bleeding.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if her underlying conditions are not adequately managed, and she may require further evaluation and treatment to address the anemia.
6. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload may worsen if her diuresis is not adequately managed, and she may require further interventions to control the fluid overload.
7. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen if her diuresis is not adequately managed, and she may require further interventions to control the pulmonary edema.
8. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if her SBP drops further, and she may require further interventions to control the hypotension.

Recommendations:

1. Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen to manage the patient's respiratory distress.
2. Continue gentle diuresis with lasix to manage the patient's fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
3. Continue rate control measures with amiodarone and metoprolol to manage the patient's tachycardia.
4. Consider a cardiology consult to further evaluate and manage the patient's NSTEMI.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider endoscopy and other interventions to control the bleeding.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and consider further evaluation and treatment to address the anemia.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid overload and pulmonary edema and consider further interventions to control these conditions.
8. Consider a neurology consult to further evaluate and manage the patient's history of CVA."

   aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over
   next 24hrs.
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, atrovent nebs prn, xopenex
   nebs prn
   - Continue levo/flagyl for a possible aspiration PNA until her
   respiratory status is stable.
   # tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a h/o afib on coumadin although
   rhythm currently appears regular likely aflutter She was given 5 mg IV
   lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the 130's.  She was
   started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an A-line was
   placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given 150 mg IV
   bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP dropped
   when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy to the
   130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - Continue amiodarone loading and 200 mg of po amiodarone [**Hospital1 **].
   - Consider cards consult for better rate control.
   # NSTEMI: Likely secondary to demand from anemia, resp distress, and
   tachycardia. CK 159 -->139 --> 115  MB 12 --> 9 --> 7  Trop 0.39 -->
   0.38 --> 0.37.  Currently chest pain free.
   - trend CE, daily EKGs
   - once her HR is better controlled, consider checking a TTE
   - Continue 12.5 mg of metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] and her statin.
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
   # GIB: GI aware but patient not stable currently for endoscopy; given
   concurrent NSTEMI, risk:benefit ratio may favor endoscopy earlier, as
   definitively addressing bleeding may allow earlier
   anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy.  INR reversed at OSH, this am 1.3
   - Continue hold anticoagulation for now
   - continue Protonix IV
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - Hct has been in the low 30
s and stable.  Can check another Hct in 8
   hrs and if stable, move to [**Hospital1 **] Hct checks.
   # h/o CVA: on anticoagulation as outpatient but GIB currently precludes
   this
   - monitor neuro exam
   - hold anticoagulation due to recent GIB
   # hypertension: Her BP was elevated on admission likely from
   respiratory distress.  She was given metoprolol for rate control and
   loaded with amiodarone as above and her SBPs dropped to the point she
   required neo for a short period of time.
   -  Continue to monitor BP closely.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin
   # Depression: Continue citalopram

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # respiratory distress/COPD/PNA: The patient has a history of COPD,
   likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload. On
   High-flow over the day and last night.  ABG on arrival was 7.45/39/55
   and there was discussion about intubating her, however she was strongly
   against being intubated, even after it was explained that it would only
   be for a short amount of time.  Her family discussed the issue with
   her, but by the time she had agreed to undergo intubation, she had
   improved somewhat so she was continued on the high flow mask.  She was
   given 80 mg IV lasix x 1 for diuresis in the afternoon and over night
   started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR
   showed evdience of pulmonary edema.  There was also a question of an

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, PUD, COPD, CKD, CVA, HTN, and hyperlipidemia. She was transferred from another hospital with black stools, hypoxemia, and tachyarrhythmia with respiratory distress. She was intubated and mechanically ventilated, but refused intubation and was subsequently placed on high-flow oxygen. Her condition has improved somewhat, but she remains tachycardic and has ongoing respiratory distress.

The patient has a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) likely secondary to demand ischemia from anemia, respiratory distress, and tachycardia. She has also had a gastrointestinal bleed, which has been managed with proton pump inhibitors and has been advised to hold anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL, and elevated troponin levels. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) shows atrial flutter, and her chest X-ray shows evidence of pulmonary edema.

The patient's plan of care includes continued ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen, gentle diuresis with lasix, and treatment for her COPD. She is also being treated for her tachyarrhythmia with amiodarone and metoprolol, and is being monitored for further signs of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and tachypnea may progress to respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachyarrhythmia may persist or worsen, requiring further treatment with medications such as amiodarone and metoprolol.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed may recur, requiring further management with proton pump inhibitors and consideration for endoscopy.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, requiring further treatment with blood transfusions and consideration for iron supplementation.
5. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen, requiring further treatment with diuretics and consideration for intubation and mechanical ventilation.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's NSTEMI may progress to more severe cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
7. Infection: The patient's respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms may be caused by an underlying infection, such as pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia, which may require further treatment with antibiotics."

   Assessment and Plan
   69F w/ h/o afib on coumadin, PUD, COPD, CKD, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia transferred from [**Hospital1 709**] by family request after presenting
   with black stools, developed hypoxemia and tachyarrhythmia with RVR,
   now with continued respiratory distress complicated by demand ischemia.
   # respiratory distress/COPD/PNA: The patient has a history of COPD,
   likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload. On
   High-flow over the day and last night.  ABG on arrival was 7.45/39/55
   and there was discussion about intubating her, however she was strongly
   against being intubated, even after it was explained that it would only
   be for a short amount of time.  Her family discussed the issue with
   her, but by the time she had agreed to undergo intubation, she had
   improved somewhat so she was continued on the high flow mask.  She was
   given 80 mg IV lasix x 1 for diuresis in the afternoon and over night
   started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR
   showed evdience of pulmonary edema.  There was also a question of an
   aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over
   next 24hrs.
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, and standing atrovent nebs
   and xopenex nebs
   - Continue levo/flagyl for a possible aspiration PNA until her
   respiratory status is stable.  Will send a sputum culture.
   # tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a h/o afib on coumadin although
   rhythm currently appears regular likely aflutter She was given 5 mg IV
   lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the 130's.  She was
   started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an A-line was
   placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given 150 mg IV
   bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP dropped
   when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy to the
   130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - Continue amiodarone loading and 200 mg of po amiodarone [**Hospital1 **].  Also
   continue metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   # NSTEMI: Likely secondary to demand from anemia, resp distress, and
   tachycardia. CK 159 -->139 --> 115
98  MB 12 --> 9 --> 7
5  Trop 0.39
   --> 0.38 --> 0.37
 0.23.  Currently chest pain free.
   - As her CEs have been trending down, no need to continue trending.
   - once her HR is better controlled, consider checking a TTE
   - Continue 12.5 mg of metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] and her statin.
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
   # GIB: GI aware but patient not stable currently for endoscopy; given
   concurrent NSTEMI, risk:benefit ratio may favor endoscopy earlier, as
   definitively addressing bleeding may allow earlier
   anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy.  INR reversed at OSH, this am
   1.3.  No further clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue hold anticoagulation for now
   - continue Protonix IV.
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - Hct has been in the low 30
s and stable.  Can check another Hct in 8
   hrs and if stable, move to [**Hospital1 **] Hct checks.
   # h/o CVA: on anticoagulation as outpatient but GIB currently precludes
   this
   - monitor neuro exam
   - hold anticoagulation due to recent GIB
   # hypertension: Her BP was elevated on admission likely from
   respiratory distress.  She was given metoprolol for rate control and
   loaded with amiodarone as above and her SBPs dropped to the point she
   required neo for a short period of time.
   -  Continue to monitor BP closely.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin
   # Depression: Continue citalopram
   # Code: DNR/DNI
   # Contact: daughter [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 3600**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3601**] (h), [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3602**] (w);
   also spoke with son [**Name (NI) 1247**] at bedside
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: ADAT as long as her Hct remains stable.
   Glycemic Control:  SSI
   Lines:   Will have a PICC placed and plan to pull her femoral line once
   her IV requirements decrease.

   Code status: DNR/DNI
 The patient has stated multiple times that she
   does not want to be intubated or resuscitated and only agreed to this

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Intubation was discussed with the patient and her family and she
   agreed to undergo intubation for a short period of time to get over her
   acute illness but stated that she would no want to be on a ventilator
   for a long period of time.
   - A femoral line was placed for access.
   - Found to have an NSTEMI. CK 159 -->139 --> 115  MB 12 --> 9 --> 7
   Trop 0.39 --> 0.38 --> 0.37
   - Given 5 mg IV lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the
   130's.  She was started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an
   A-line was placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given
   150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP
   dropped when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy
   to the 130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - Repeat evening Hct was 33.2 (from 35.4).
   - Her neo was weaned off overnight and she was started on a low-dose
   lasix gtt given her persistently low PaO2 to try to diurese her gently.
   This am she denies pain, shortness of breath, or other complaints.  No
   further episodes of bleeding.

   69F w/ h/o afib on coumadin, PUD, COPD, CKD, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia transferred from [**Hospital1 709**] by family request after presenting
   with black stools, developed hypoxemia and tachyarrhythmia with RVR,
   now with continued respiratory distress complicated by demand ischemia.
   # respiratory distress/COPD/PNA: The patient has a history of COPD,
   likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload. On
   High-flow over the day and last night.  ABG on arrival was 7.45/39/55
   and there was discussion about intubating her, however she was strongly
   against being intubated, even after it was explained that it would only
   be for a short amount of time.  Her family discussed the issue with
   her, but by the time she had agreed to undergo intubation, she had
   improved somewhat so she was continued on the high flow mask.  She was
   given 80 mg IV lasix x 1 for diuresis in the afternoon and over night
   started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR
   showed evdience of pulmonary edema.  There was also a question of an
   aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over
   next 24hrs.
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, and standing atrovent nebs
   and xopenex nebs
   - Continue levo/flagyl for a possible aspiration PNA until her
   respiratory status is stable.  Will send a sputum culture.
   # tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a h/o afib on coumadin although
   rhythm currently appears regular likely aflutter She was given 5 mg IV
   lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the 130's.  She was
   started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an A-line was
   placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given 150 mg IV
   bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP dropped
   when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy to the
   130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - Continue amiodarone loading and 200 mg of po amiodarone [**Hospital1 **].  Also
   continue metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   # NSTEMI: Likely secondary to demand from anemia, resp distress, and

   - As her CEs have been trending down, no need to continue trending.
   - once her HR is better controlled, consider checking a TTE
   - Continue 12.5 mg of metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] and her statin.
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
   # GIB: GI aware but patient not stable currently for endoscopy; given
   concurrent NSTEMI, risk:benefit ratio may favor endoscopy earlier, as
   definitively addressing bleeding may allow earlier
   anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy.  INR reversed at OSH, this am

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression, who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital due to respiratory distress, tachyarrhythmia, and possible aspiration pneumonia. She has been diagnosed with a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and is being treated with amiodarone and metoprolol. Her hemoglobin level is low, and she has been given a blood transfusion. She has also been treated for gastrointestinal bleeding and is being monitored for further bleeding.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and tachyarrhythmia may lead to respiratory failure, which could require intubation.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and current tachyarrhythmia may lead to further cardiac arrhythmias, which could be life-threatening.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and current bleeding may lead to further bleeding, which could be life-threatening.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level may lead to anemia, which could worsen her respiratory and cardiac symptoms.
5. Infection: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and current respiratory distress may lead to further infection, which could be life-threatening.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of hypertension and current tachyarrhythmia may lead to cardiovascular instability, which could be life-threatening.
7. Renal failure: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and current low hemoglobin level may lead to renal failure, which could be life-threatening.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's history of cerebrovascular accident and current respiratory distress may lead to neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if her condition worsens.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider further treatment for her tachyarrhythmia.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider further treatment if necessary.
4. Consider transfusing blood products to improve the patient's anemia.
5. Consider further treatment for the patient's aspiration pneumonia, such as antibiotics or bronchodilators.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular stability and consider further treatment if necessary.
7. Consider further treatment for the patient's renal failure, such as dialysis.
8. Consider further treatment for the patient's neurological symptoms, such as anticonvulsants or anti-seizure medication."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of their health status:

The patient remains hypoxemic and tachycardic, with a NSTEMI diagnosis. They were started on Amiodarone and had an arterial line inserted, requiring neosulfocaine for blood pressure support. The patient has had no further gastrointestinal bleeding, and their ABG results show a pH of 7.54/27/63.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 142 bpm, and blood pressure of 119/71 mmHg. They have a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 99%. Their heart rhythm is atrial flutter.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual with no signs of lymphadenopathy, cardiovascular or peripheral vascular abnormalities, and respiratory or abdominal tenderness. They are unable to stand due to muscle weakness.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 23.1, hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 488. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, with the exception of a slightly elevated troponin-T level of 0.39.

The patient's medical history is significant for a myocardial infarction, acute (NSTEMI), gastrointestinal bleeding, lower, and tachycardia, other. They have a demand ischemia and are being treated with statins, beta blockers, and holding ASA. The patient's respiratory status is acute, with possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's NSTEMI diagnosis increases their risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's acute respiratory failure and possible COPD increase their risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and respiratory arrest.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and possible gastrointestinal bleeding, lower, increase their risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as hemorrhage, perforation, and sepsis.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's tachycardia and possible cardiac arrhythmias increase their risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, and cognitive impairment.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and possible respiratory and gastrointestinal infections increase their risk of infection, including sepsis and septic shock.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   69F w/ h/o afib on coumadin, PUD, COPD, CKD, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia transferred from [**Hospital1 709**] by family request after presenting
   with black stools, developed hypoxemia and tachyarrhythmia with RVR,
   now with continued respiratory distress complicated by demand ischemia.
   # Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a h/o afib on coumadin although
   rhythm currently appears regular likely aflutter She was given 5 mg IV
   lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the 130's.  She was
   started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an A-line was
   placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given 150 mg IV
   bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP dropped
   when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy to the
   130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - Continue amiodarone loading and 200 mg of po amiodarone [**Hospital1 **].  Also
   continue metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   # Respiratory distress/COPD/PNA: The patient has a history of COPD,
   likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload. On
   High-flow over the day and last night.  ABG on arrival was 7.45/39/55
   and there was discussion about intubating her, however she was strongly
   against being intubated, even after it was explained that it would only
   be for a short amount of time.  Her family discussed the issue with
   her, but by the time she had agreed to undergo intubation, she had
   improved somewhat so she was continued on the high flow mask.  She was
   given 80 mg IV lasix x 1 for diuresis in the afternoon and over night
   started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR
   showed evdience of pulmonary edema.  There was also a question of an
   aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over
   next 24hrs.
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, and standing atrovent nebs
   and xopenex nebs
   - Continue levo/flagyl for a possible aspiration PNA until her
   respiratory status is stable.  Will send a sputum culture.
   # NSTEMI: Likely secondary to demand from anemia, resp distress, and
   tachycardia. CK 159 -->139 --> 115
98  MB 12 --> 9 --> 7
5  Trop 0.39
   --> 0.38 --> 0.37
 0.23.  Currently chest pain free.
   - As her CEs have been trending down, no need to continue trending.
   - once her HR is better controlled, consider checking a TTE
   - Continue 12.5 mg of metoprolol [**Hospital1 **] and her statin.
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
   # GIB: GI aware but patient not stable currently for endoscopy; given
   concurrent NSTEMI, risk:benefit ratio may favor endoscopy earlier, as
   definitively addressing bleeding may allow earlier
   anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy.  INR reversed at OSH, this am
   1.3.  No further clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Continue hold anticoagulation for now
   - continue Protonix IV.
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - Hct has been in the low 30
s and stable.  Can check another Hct in 8
   hrs and if stable, move to [**Hospital1 **] Hct checks.
   # h/o CVA: on anticoagulation as outpatient but GIB currently precludes
   this
   - monitor neuro exam
   - hold anticoagulation due to recent GIB
   # hypertension: Her BP was elevated on admission likely from
   respiratory distress.  She was given metoprolol for rate control and
   loaded with amiodarone as above and her SBPs dropped to the point she
   required neo for a short period of time.
   -  Continue to monitor BP closely.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin
   # Depression: Continue citalopram

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Tachyarrhythmia: The patient has a h/o afib on coumadin although
   rhythm currently appears regular likely aflutter She was given 5 mg IV
   lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the 130's.  She was

   placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given 150 mg IV
   bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP dropped
   when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy to the
   130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - Continue amiodarone loading and 200 mg of po amiodarone [**Hospital1 **].  Also
   continue metoprolol 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **].

   and there was discussion about intubating her, however she was strongly
   against being intubated, even after it was explained that it would only
   be for a short amount of time.  Her family discussed the issue with
   her, but by the time she had agreed to undergo intubation, she had
   improved somewhat so she was continued on the high flow mask.  She was
   given 80 mg IV lasix x 1 for diuresis in the afternoon and over night
   started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR
   showed evdience of pulmonary edema.  There was also a question of an
   aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over
   next 24hrs.
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, and standing atrovent nebs
   and xopenex nebs

   - Continue hold anticoagulation for now
   - continue Protonix IV.
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs

Summary:

The patient, a 69-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. She has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, history of cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. She presented with black stools, hypoxemia, and tachyarrhythmia with right ventricular failure. The patient was started on amiodarone and metoprolol for rate control, and was given lasix for diuresis. She was also started on high-flow oxygen and nebulizers for COPD treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress is likely exacerbated by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload. She was started on high-flow oxygen and nebulizers, but if her condition deteriorates, intubation may be necessary.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and was given amiodarone and metoprolol for rate control. She also has a NSTEMI, likely secondary to demand from anemia, respiratory distress, and tachycardia.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, which is currently precluding anticoagulation therapy. She is at risk for further bleeding and requires close monitoring.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of cerebrovascular accident and is on anticoagulation therapy. However, her recent gastrointestinal bleeding has precluded anticoagulation therapy. She requires close monitoring of her neurological status.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure was elevated on admission, likely due to respiratory distress. She was given metoprolol for rate control, and her blood pressure dropped to the point where she required neo for a short period of time. Close monitoring of her blood pressure is necessary.
6. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient is on a statin for hypercholesterolemia, but her recent cardiac event may require adjustments to her medication regimen.
7. Depression: The patient is on citalopram for depression, but her recent hospitalization and medical complications may require adjustments to her medication regimen.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's acute myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal bleeding, tachycardia, and respiratory failure require close monitoring and treatment. The patient's cardiac status requires close monitoring, and her gastrointestinal bleeding requires close monitoring and treatment. The patient's respiratory status requires close monitoring, and her COPD treatment requires close monitoring and adjustments as necessary. The patient's neurological status requires close monitoring, and her history of cerebrovascular accident requires close monitoring and treatment. The patient's hypertension requires close monitoring, and her hypercholesterolemia requires close monitoring and treatment. The patient's depression requires close monitoring and treatment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   rhythm currently appears regular likely aflutter She was given 5 mg IV
   lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the 130's.  She was
   started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an A-line was
   placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given 150 mg IV
   bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP dropped
   when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy to the
   130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - increase BB to 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - cards c/s for possible ablation
   # Respiratory distress/COPD/PNA:  On 6L nc this morning. Leukocytosis
   resolving.  Scattered crackles on exam.  The patient has a history of
   COPD, likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload.
   On High-flow over the day and last night.  ABG on arrival was
   7.45/39/55 and there was discussion about intubating her, however she
   was strongly against being intubated, even after it was explained that
   it would only be for a short amount of time.  Her family discussed the
   issue with her, but by the time she had agreed to undergo intubation,
   she had improved somewhat so she was continued on the high flow mask.
   She was given 80 mg IV lasix x 1 for diuresis in the afternoon and over
   night started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR
   showed evdience of pulmonary edema.  There was also a question of an
   aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over
   next 24hrs.
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, and standing atrovent nebs
   and xopenex nebs
   - Continue levo/CTX for a possible aspiration PNA until her respiratory
   status is stable
   # CRI:  Cr at 1.4 this morning, stable even with Lasix diuresis

   - As her CEs have been trending down, no need to continue trending.
   - once her HR is better controlled, consider checking a TTE
   - increase metoprolol to 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue statin
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
   # GIB: Stable hct for 24 hours around 30.  GI aware.  Given tachcardia
   and stable hct, would likely need to resolve cardiac arrythmias before
   proceeding with scope though she does need one.
   - Continue holding  anticoagulation for now
   - continue Protonix IV.
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - check pm hct
   # h/o CVA: on anticoagulation as outpatient but GIB currently precludes
   this
   - monitor neuro exam
   - hold anticoagulation due to recent GIB
   # hypertension: Her BP was elevated on admission likely from
   respiratory distress.  Has been low normotensive for several days.  She
   was given metoprolol for rate control and loaded with amiodarone as
   above and her SBPs dropped to the point she required neo for a short
   period of time.
   -  Continue to monitor BP closely.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, tachyarrhythmia, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.5°F) with a current temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 142 beats per minute (bpm) with a regular rhythm
* Blood pressure: 129/70 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin, but her current rhythm appears to be atrial flutter. She has been treated with various medications, including diltiazem, amiodarone, and metoprolol, without significant improvement.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.7 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 29.4%
* White blood cell count: 23.1
* Platelet count: 307
* Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.15 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 2.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.4 g/dL
* LDH: 383 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.3 mg/dL

The patient's chest X-ray shows evidence of pulmonary edema, and her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show:

* pH: 7.45
* PaO2: 39 mmHg
* PaCO2: 55 mmHg

The patient's respiratory status is complicated by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and she has been treated with high-flow oxygen and bronchodilators. Her gastrointestinal bleeding is being managed with proton pump inhibitors and close monitoring.

The patient's cardiac status is complicated by her history of atrial fibrillation and her current tachyarrhythmia. She has been treated with various medications, including diltiazem, amiodarone, and metoprolol, without significant improvement.

The patient's neurologic status is stable, and she is being monitored for any signs of neurologic deterioration.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Myocardial infarction (MI)
* Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB)
* Tachycardia
* Respiratory failure
* Acute kidney injury (AKI)

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Respiratory failure
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Acute kidney injury
* Neurologic deterioration

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen
* Continue gentle diuresis with lasix
* Continue COPD treatment with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy
* Continue cardiac treatment with metoprolol and amiodarone
* Monitor neurologic status closely
* Monitor for signs of cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory failure
* Monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and acute kidney injury

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of her various medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history. The patient has a myocardial infarction (MI), acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI), with demand ischemia, and is receiving treatment with statins, beta blockers, and holding aspirin.

The patient also has gastrointestinal bleeding, lower (hematochezia, BRBPR, GI bleed, GIB), which is being managed with hemodynamic monitoring and diuresis. The patient is also experiencing tachycardia, other (A-flutter), and is being treated with amiodarone and metoprolol.

Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), is also present, with volume overload and possible CAP. The patient is receiving high-flow oxygen and nebulized treatments.

Other conditions present include COPD, which is being managed with nebulized treatments and optimal medications.

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's MI and tachycardia (A-flutter) increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and even death.
2. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to further bleeding, anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure and possible CAP increase the risk of respiratory distress, ARDS, and death.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's COPD and volume overload may lead to cardiac failure, pulmonary edema, and even death.
5. Infection complications: The patient's possible CAP and VAP increase the risk of sepsis, septic shock, and death.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's hemodynamic instability may lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and death.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   for continued diuresis as her CXR showed evdience of pulmonary edema.
   There was also a question of an aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. She was admitted to the ICU with acute myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal bleeding, tachycardia, and respiratory failure. She has been treated with various medications, including beta blockers, antiplatelet agents, and anticoagulants.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/57 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is receiving mechanical ventilation and has a central venous catheter and arterial line in place. Her laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating ongoing cardiac damage.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent tachycardia increase her risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely exacerbated by her tachycardia, pulmonary disease, and fluid overload. She may require continued mechanical ventilation and diuresis to manage her respiratory distress.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is a concern, particularly given her history of bleeding and the need for anticoagulation therapy. She may require continued monitoring and management of her bleeding risk.
4. Infection: The patient's respiratory failure and gastrointestinal bleeding increase her risk of developing infections, including pneumonia or sepsis.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's history of cerebrovascular accident and ongoing anticoagulation therapy increase her risk of developing neurological complications, including bleeding or stroke.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low normotensive, and she may require continued monitoring and management of her blood pressure to prevent hypotension.
7. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload is a concern, particularly given her respiratory failure and gastrointestinal bleeding. She may require continued diuresis and monitoring of her fluid status.
8. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's cardiac dysfunction, including her recent myocardial infarction and ongoing cardiac damage, may require continued monitoring and management to prevent further cardiac complications."

   which agaon had no effect. Pt was then transitioned to Dilit gtt which
   she responded to with only 5mg/hr. This AM her HR is now more

   was on a Furosemide gtt  and over night started on a low-dose lasix gtt
   for continued diuresis as her CXR showed evdience of pulmonary edema.
   There was also a question of a PNA at the OSH for which she was
   continued on Levofloxacin.
   - Continue diuresis but will transition off of Lasix drip to IV BID.
   Her 24 hour Lasix requirement on drip on average is 48mg, will give
   40mg IV Lasix this AM and assess response. Would keep a goal of -500cc
   to -1l. Will assess if [**Hospital1 **] 40mg IV Lasix would be needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. She was admitted to the ICU with acute myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal bleeding, tachycardia, and respiratory failure. She was previously taking coumadin, metoprolol, and amiodarone, but these medications were discontinued due to lack of effect.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tachycardic with a heart rate of 72-145 bpm, blood pressure of 121/57 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen delivery, with an ABG of 29/29.
* Cardiovascular: Tachycardic and regular, with no murmurs.
* Gastrointestinal: Hematochezia, bradypnea, and respiratory distress.
* Neurological: Alert and oriented x3, with no focal neurological deficits.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 23.1-10.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.5-7.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 488-294 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.2-1.5 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.38-0.15 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 2.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.7 g/dL
* LDH: 329 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.5 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 1.8 mg/dL

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Weaning off Diltiazem drip and transitioning to PO regimen
* Starting beta blocker therapy at 75mg tid and Diltiazem 30mg QID
* Continuing diuresis with IV Lasix BID
* Continuing COPD treatment with Advair, Spiriva, and standing Atrovent nebs and Xopenex nebs
* Continuing Levofloxacin for a 5-day total course
* Trending creatinine and repleting electrolytes as needed
* Considering a TTE once the patient's heart rate is better controlled
* Continuing statin therapy
* Holding off on anticoagulation due to recent gastrointestinal bleeding
* Monitoring neuro exam and holding anticoagulation due to recent gastrointestinal bleeding
* Continuing to monitor blood pressure closely

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to further decline in oxygenation and ventilation.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may continue or worsen, leading to further blood loss and potential complications.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and potential demand ischemia may lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
* Infection: The patient's respiratory failure and gastrointestinal bleeding may increase the risk of infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis.
* Renal failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease and potential nephrotoxicity from medications may lead to further decline in renal function.
* Neurological complications: The patient's history of cerebrovascular accident and potential anticoagulation-related bleeding may increase the risk of further neurological complications."

   hyperlipidemia transferred from [**Hospital1 709**] by family request after presenting
   with black stools, developed hypoxemia and tachyarrhythmia with RVR,

s.  Overnight, dilt iv and po tried with increasing doses
   without effect .  The patient has a h/o afib on coumadin although
   rhythm currently appears regular likely aflutter She was given 5 mg IV
   lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the 130's.  She was
   started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an A-line was
   placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given 150 mg IV
   bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP dropped
   when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy to the
   130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - increase BB to 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - cards c/s for possible ablation
   # Respiratory distress/COPD/PNA:  On 6L nc this morning. Leukocytosis
   resolving.  Scattered crackles on exam.  The patient has a history of
   COPD, likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload.
   On High-flow over the day and last night.  ABG on arrival was
   7.45/39/55 and there was discussion about intubating her, however she
   was strongly against being intubated, even after it was explained that
   it would only be for a short amount of time.  Her family discussed the
   issue with her, but by the time she had agreed to undergo intubation,
   she had improved somewhat so she was continued on the high flow mask.
   She was given 80 mg IV lasix x 1 for diuresis in the afternoon and over
   night started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR
   showed evdience of pulmonary edema.  There was also a question of an
   aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over
   next 24hrs.
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, and standing atrovent nebs
   and xopenex nebs
   - Continue levo/CTX for a possible aspiration PNA until her respiratory
   status is stable
   # CRI:  Cr at 1.4 this morning, stable even with Lasix diuresis
   - trend
   - replete lytes prn
   # NSTEMI: Likely secondary to demand from anemia, resp distress, and
   tachycardia. CK 159 -->139 --> 115
98  MB 12 --> 9 --> 7
5  Trop 0.39
   --> 0.38 --> 0.37
 0.23.  Currently chest pain free.
   - As her CEs have been trending down, no need to continue trending.
   - once her HR is better controlled, consider checking a TTE
   - increase metoprolol to 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue statin
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
   # GIB: Stable hct for 24 hours around 30.  GI aware.  Given tachcardia
   and stable hct, would likely need to resolve cardiac arrythmias before
   proceeding with scope though she does need one.
   - Continue holding  anticoagulation for now
   - continue Protonix IV.
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - check pm hct
   # h/o CVA: on anticoagulation as outpatient but GIB currently precludes
   this
   - monitor neuro exam
   - hold anticoagulation due to recent GIB
   # hypertension: Her BP was elevated on admission likely from
   respiratory distress.  Has been low normotensive for several days.  She
   was given metoprolol for rate control and loaded with amiodarone as
   above and her SBPs dropped to the point she required neo for a short
   period of time.
   -  Continue to monitor BP closely.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin
   # Depression: Continue citalopram

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   lopressor x 2 and 25 mg po, but her HR remained in the 130's.  She was
   started on an amiodarone gtt and po amiodarone and an A-line was
   placed.  She continued to be tachycardic and was then given 150 mg IV
   bolus of amiodarone.  She was also started on neo as her SBP dropped
   when the amiodarone was started.  In the am she was still tachy to the
   130's so she was given another 150 mg IV bolus of amiodarone.
   - increase BB to 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - cards c/s for possible ablation
   # Respiratory distress/COPD/PNA:  On 6L nc this morning. Leukocytosis
   resolving.  Scattered crackles on exam.  The patient has a history of
   COPD, likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload.
   On High-flow over the day and last night.  ABG on arrival was
   7.45/39/55 and there was discussion about intubating her, however she
   was strongly against being intubated, even after it was explained that
   it would only be for a short amount of time.  Her family discussed the
   issue with her, but by the time she had agreed to undergo intubation,
   she had improved somewhat so she was continued on the high flow mask.
   She was given 80 mg IV lasix x 1 for diuresis in the afternoon and over
   night started on a low-dose lasix gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR
   showed evdience of pulmonary edema.  There was also a question of an
   aspiration PNA at the OSH.
   - Continue ventilatory support with high-flow oxygen.  If the patient
   clinically decomensates, would need to intubate her.
   - Continue gentle diuresis with the lasix given her vol overload on CXR
   (likely [**2-16**] transfusion, IVF at OSH), goal I/O 500 cc to 1 L neg over
   next 24hrs.
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, and standing atrovent nebs
   and xopenex nebs
   - Continue levo/CTX for a possible aspiration PNA until her respiratory
   status is stable
   # CRI:  Cr at 1.4 this morning, stable even with Lasix diuresis
   - trend
   - replete lytes prn
   # NSTEMI: Likely secondary to demand from anemia, resp distress, and
   tachycardia. CK 159 -->139 --> 115
98  MB 12 --> 9 --> 7
5  Trop 0.39
   --> 0.38 --> 0.37
 0.23.  Currently chest pain free.
   - As her CEs have been trending down, no need to continue trending.
   - once her HR is better controlled, consider checking a TTE
   - increase metoprolol to 25mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue statin
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
   # GIB: Stable hct for 24 hours around 30.  GI aware.  Given tachcardia
   and stable hct, would likely need to resolve cardiac arrythmias before
   proceeding with scope though she does need one.
   - Continue holding  anticoagulation for now
   - continue Protonix IV.
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - check pm hct
   # h/o CVA: on anticoagulation as outpatient but GIB currently precludes
   this
   - monitor neuro exam
   - hold anticoagulation due to recent GIB
   # hypertension: Her BP was elevated on admission likely from
   respiratory distress.  Has been low normotensive for several days.  She
   was given metoprolol for rate control and loaded with amiodarone as
   above and her SBPs dropped to the point she required neo for a short
   period of time.
   -  Continue to monitor BP closely.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin
   # Depression: Continue citalopram

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and hyperlipidemia, who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital after presenting with black stools, hypoxemia, and tachyarrhythmia with right ventricular overload. She was diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal bleeding, tachycardia, and respiratory failure. She has been hemodynamically stable, but has required increasing doses of beta blockers and amiodarone to control her heart rate. She has also been treated for respiratory distress with high-flow oxygen and has undergone diuresis with lasix to manage fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Demand ischemia: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may be causing demand ischemia, which could lead to further cardiac damage.
	* Arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent use of amiodarone may increase the risk of arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia.
	* Cardiac tamponade: The patient's history of pulmonary disease and recent use of lasix may increase the risk of cardiac tamponade.
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia may lead to further respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
	* Pneumonia: The patient's history of pulmonary disease and recent use of antibiotics may increase the risk of pneumonia.
3. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's recent gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to further bleeding, including bleeding into the abdominal cavity or retroperitoneal space.
	* Intestinal obstruction: The patient's history of pulmonary disease and recent use of lasix may increase the risk of intestinal obstruction.
4. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury: The patient's recent use of lasix and history of chronic kidney disease may increase the risk of acute kidney injury.
	* Chronic kidney disease progression: The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and recent use of lasix may lead to further progression of the disease.
5. Neurological Complications:
	* Cerebral edema: The patient's history of pulmonary disease and recent use of lasix may increase the risk of cerebral edema.
	* Seizures: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent use of amiodarone may increase the risk of seizures.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and addressing any potential complications promptly to prevent further deterioration of her condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo female with history of A-fib on coumadin now seen with GI Bleed
   and hospital course complicated by CHF, NSTEMI and A-fib with RVR.  She
   has had substantial improvement over time with the balance of fluid
   maintained as negative where possible.
   GI BLEED-
   -EGD for today if recurrent bleeding seen--will maintain control of
   coagulopathy going forward given bleeding
   -Continue 2 P-IV's for access
   -T+C current
   -FU HCT this pm
   -Move to [**Hospital1 **] PPI
   ATRIAL FLUTTER-
   -Will maintain Dilt gtt and titrate up
   -Lopressor to continue
75mg tid
   -Goal HR is to be at or less than 100.  This is a challenge as patient
   has rapid elevation in HR with minimal stimulus.
   -We understant the reluctance to continue amiodarone but if unable to
   maintain stable HR with GIB resolved will have to consider further
   intervention.
   -In the interim will move to PO Dilt dosing
30mg qid
   ANEMIA-SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS
   -F/U HCT this pm
   -Will transfuse for acute change
   Congestive Heart Failure--Acute and Diastolic appears to be source at
   this time
in the setting of refractory tachycardia.
   -Lasix gtt to continue
   -HR control as above
   -Current diagnosis is demand ischemia with acute stress leading to
   sub-endocardial insult

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   -Goal HR is to be at or less than 100.  This is a challenge as patient
   has rapid elevation in HR with minimal stimulus.
   -We understant the reluctance to continue amiodarone but if unable to
   maintain stable HR with GIB resolved will have to consider further
   intervention.
   -In the interim will move to PO Dilt dosing

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation (A-fib) on coumadin, who has developed a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, hypoxia, and atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The patient has had a significant improvement in oxygenation with diuresis and has been managed with various medications and infusions.

The patient's current condition is complicated by congestive heart failure (CHF), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and atrial flutter with RVR. The patient has anemia secondary to blood loss, and her laboratory results show elevated troponin-T and creatinine levels.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. GI bleed: The patient has had a significant GI bleed, and there is a risk of further bleeding, especially with the presence of atrial flutter with RVR.
2. CHF: The patient's CHF is acute and diastolic, and there is a risk of further decompensation if not managed properly.
3. NSTEMI: The patient's NSTEMI is ongoing, and there is a risk of further myocardial damage if not managed properly.
4. Atrial flutter with RVR: The patient's atrial flutter with RVR is challenging to manage, and there is a risk of further tachycardia and cardiac complications if not managed properly.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss, and there is a risk of further anemia if not managed properly.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, and there is a risk of further respiratory deterioration if not managed properly.
7. Infection: The patient has a risk of infection due to her GI bleed and prolonged hospitalization.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. EGD for today if recurrent bleeding is seen
2. Maintenance of control of coagulopathy
3. Continued 2 P-IV's for access
4. T+C current
5. FU HCT this pm
6. Move to PO PPI
7. Maintenance of Dilt gtt and titration up
8. Lopressor to continue
9. Goal HR is to be at or less than 100
10. Potential consideration of further intervention if unable to maintain stable HR with GIB resolved
11. Move to PO Dilt dosing
12. F/U HCT this pm
13. Transfusion for acute change
14. Lasix gtt to continue
15. HR control as above
16. Current diagnosis is demand ischemia with acute stress leading to sub-endocardial insult

The patient's ICU care includes:

1. Nutrition: Return to PO diet with patient not going for procedure today
2. Glycemic control: Regular insulin sliding scale
3. Lines: Multi-lumen and arterial line
4. Prophylaxis: DVT boots and stress ulcer prophylaxis
5. VAP prophylaxis
6. Comments: The patient's condition is complicated, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further complications."

   Chief Complaint: GI Bleed
   24 Hour Events:
   - The patient was started on 30 mg of dilt qid and her metoprolol was
   increased to 75 mg tid. The dilt gtt was weaned off.  Her rate remained
   in the low 100's.  Cardiology signed off.  Her rate remained in the
   110's so her diltiazem was increased to 60 mg qid.
   - As her Hct has been stable and she's had no signs of bleeding, GI
   wants to wait to do the EGD once she's on the floor and rate-controlled
   better.
   - A TTE showed: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is
   borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   - Her last day of levaquin should be on the 27th.

   for continued diuresis as her CXR showed evdience of pulmonary edema.
   There was also a question of a PNA at the OSH for which she was
   continued on Levofloxacin.
   - Continue diuresis but will transition off of Lasix drip to IV BID.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   was on a Furosemide gtt  and over night started on a low-dose lasix gtt
   for continued diuresis as her CXR showed evdience of pulmonary edema.
   There was also a question of a PNA at the OSH for which she was
   continued on Levofloxacin.
   - Continue diuresis but will transition off of Lasix drip to IV BID.
   Her 24 hour Lasix requirement on drip on average is 48mg, will give
   40mg IV Lasix this AM and assess response. Would keep a goal of -500cc
   to -1l. Will assess if [**Hospital1 **] 40mg IV Lasix would be needed.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression.

The patient's 24-hour events include:

* Cardiology consultation was obtained for refractory atrial flutter, and the patient was started on diltiazem and metoprolol.
* The patient's heart rate remained in the low 100s, and then increased to the 110s, prompting an increase in diltiazem to 60 mg qid.
* A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed mild dilation of the left atrium, low-normal left ventricular systolic function, and borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
* The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has been stable, and gastrointestinal (GI) wants to wait to perform an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGD) until the patient is on the floor and rate-controlled.
* The patient's last day of levofloxacin is on the 27th.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 74-117 bpm
* Blood pressure: 138/63 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18-23 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 93%
* Height: 60 inches
* Weight: Not recorded
* Fluid balance: -1,216 mL over the past 24 hours

The patient's laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 22.4-8.5 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 30.0-32.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 332-94 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.2-1.5 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.37-0.15 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 2.2 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.7 g/dL
* LDH: 329 IU/L
* Calcium: 9.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.4 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Myocardial infarction, acute (NSTEMI)
* Gastrointestinal bleed, lower
* Tachycardia, other
* Respiratory failure, acute
* Chronic kidney disease
* Hyperlipidemia
* History of cerebrovascular accident
* Hypertension
* Depression

The patient's plan includes:

* Weaning off of diltiazem gtt with PO regimen
* Starting beta blocker therapy at 75 mg tid
* Increasing metoprolol to 75 mg tid
* Continuing diuresis with lasix
* Continuing levofloxacin for 5 days
* Monitoring neuro exam
* Holding anticoagulation due to recent GI bleed
* Continuing statin therapy
* Continuing citalopram for depression

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further GI bleeding
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Kidney injury
* Hyperkalemia
* Hypocalcemia
* Hypomagnesemia
* Hypophosphatemia
* Respiratory failure
* Sepsis
* Organ failure

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical conditions closely to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Chief Complaint: GI Bleed
   24 Hour Events:
   - The patient was started on 30 mg of dilt qid and her metoprolol was
   increased to 75 mg tid. The dilt gtt was weaned off.  Her rate remained
   in the low 100's.  Cardiology signed off.  Her rate remained in the
   110's so her diltiazem was increased to 60 mg qid.
   - As her Hct has been stable and she's had no signs of bleeding, GI
   wants to wait to do the EGD once she's on the floor and rate-controlled
   better.
   - A TTE showed: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is
   borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   - Her last day of levaquin should be on the 27th.

   # Respiratory distress/COPD/PNA:  Leukocytosis resolved at 8.5 this
   morning.  Scattered crackles on  exam.  The patient has a history of
   COPD, likely exacerbated by by her tachyarrhythmia and fluid overload.
   She was on a Furosemide gtt  and over night started on a low-dose lasix
   gtt for continued diuresis as her CXR showed evdience of pulmonary
   edema.  There was also a question of a PNA at the OSH for which she was
   continued on Levofloxacin.
   - goal I/O -1L, did on own yesterday, will reassess tonight and give iv
   lasix if needed
   - COPD treatment including advair, spiriva, and standing atrovent nebs
   and xopenex nebs
   - Continue levofloxacin for a 5 day total course  - last dose today
   # CRI:  Cr at 1.1 this morning prior increased Creatinnine most likely
   due to poor forward flow given her response to Lasix diuresis
   - trend,  replete lytes prn
   # NSTEMI: Was Likely secondary to demand from anemia, resp distress,
   and tachycardia. CK 159 -->139 --> 115
98  MB 12 --> 9 --> 7
5  Trop
   0.39 --> 0.38 --> 0.37
 0.23.  Currently chest pain free.
   - As her CEs have been trending down, no need to continue trending.
   - TTE shoued preserved EF with borderline PAH.
   - continue metoprolol to 75mg TID as above
   - continue statin
   - no ASA, no heparin [**2-16**] GI bleeding
 would benefit from ASA after EGD
   with GI
   # GIB: Stable hct for 48 hours around 30.  GI aware and given her
   stable Hct , no need for emergent EGD, will scope when pt is floor
   status.
   - continue PO BID Protonix
   - no anti-coagulation as above
   - plan for EDG with GI once on floor
   # h/o CVA: on anticoagulation as outpatient but GIB currently precludes
   this
   - monitor neuro exam
   - hold anticoagulation due to recent GIB as above
   # Hypertension: Has been hypotensive as above.  Her BP was elevated on
   admission likely from respiratory distress.  Has been low normotensive
   for several days.  She was given metoprolol for rate control and loaded
   with amiodarone as above and her SBPs dropped to the point she required
   neo for a short period of time.
   -  Continue to monitor BP closely.
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Continue statin
   # Depression: Continue citalopram

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint: GI Bleed
   24 Hour Events:
   - The patient was started on 30 mg of dilt qid and her metoprolol was
   increased to 75 mg tid. The dilt gtt was weaned off.  Her rate remained
   in the low 100's.  Cardiology signed off.  Her rate remained in the
   110's so her diltiazem was increased to 60 mg qid.
   - As her Hct has been stable and she's had no signs of bleeding, GI
   wants to wait to do the EGD once she's on the floor and rate-controlled
   better.
   - A TTE showed: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Overall left
   ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is
   borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
   - Her last day of levaquin should be on the 27th.

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient is a 69-year-old female who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital due to gastrointestinal bleeding, tachyarrhythmia, and respiratory distress. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate in the low 100s to mid-110s, and blood pressure ranging from 138/63 to 153/94 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 93% on nasal cannula. Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb) level of 30.7 g/dL, which is stable
* Platelet count (Plt) of 94 x 10^9/L
* White blood cell count (WBC) of 22.4 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr) level of 1.1 mg/dL
* Troponin-T level of 0.37 ng/mL

The patient's imaging studies, including a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), show:

* Mild dilation of the left atrium
* Low normal left ventricular systolic function (LVEF 50-55%)
* Borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension
* Mild mitral regurgitation
* No pericardial effusion

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)
* Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB)
* Tachycardia
* Respiratory failure (not ARDS)

The patient's medications include:

* Metoprolol 75 mg tid for rate control
* Diltiazem (oral and IV) for rate control and treatment of atrial fibrillation
* Furosemide (IV) for diuresis
* Lasix (IV) for diuresis
* Levofloxacin (IV) for pneumonia
* Protonix (PO) for gastrointestinal bleeding
* Statin for hypercholesterolemia
* Citalopram for depression

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, due to the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the use of antiarrhythmic medications
* Respiratory failure, which may be exacerbated by the patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and fluid overload
* Gastrointestinal bleeding, which may recur or worsen if the patient's coagulation status is not adequately managed
* Kidney injury or failure, which may be exacerbated by the patient's chronic kidney disease and the use of nephrotoxic medications
* Infection, such as pneumonia, which may be complicated by the patient's respiratory failure and immunosuppressive state.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, I recommend continued close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to ensure early detection and management of potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A-Fib with RVR). The patient's condition has improved significantly with correction of coagulopathy and supportive care.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure of 107/88 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb) level of 10.7 g/dL
* White blood cell (WBC) count of 22.4 K/uL
* Platelet count of 332 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr) level of 1.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T level of 0.37 ng/mL
* Lactic acid level of 2.2 mmol/L

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General appearance: Well-nourished
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and distant S2 sounds
* Respiratory/Chest: Symmetric expansion, resonant percussion, and clear breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right and left radial pulses are not assessed
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and movement and tone are not assessed

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient's GIB has improved with supportive care, but there is still a risk of bleeding complications.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy has been corrected, but there is still a risk of bleeding complications.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation has been controlled with medication, but there is still a risk of arrhythmias.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is stable, but there is still a risk of respiratory failure.
5. Sepsis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, which may indicate an infection.
6. Anemia: The patient's Hb level is low, which may indicate anemia.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, which may indicate cardiac damage.

Based on the patient's condition, the plan is to:

1. Continue supportive care and rate control for atrial fibrillation.
2. Monitor the patient's bleeding status and coagulopathy.
3. Continue prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
4. Transfer the patient to the floor for further care."
