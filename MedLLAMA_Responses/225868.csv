   [**2145-5-5**] ECHO:
   There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   inferior akinesis and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mitral
   regurgitation is probably moderate but was not fully assessed. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation
   is present but was not fully assessed. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension.
   A catheter is seen in the right atrium. There is a small mobile
   echodense structure (~0.4x1.0 cm) near the junction of the SVC and
   right atrium (see cell 28) that may be adherent to catheter. This
   structure is in the same vicinity as echodense structures seen in the
   prior study of [**2145-4-2**] but fewer views were obtained so comparison is
   limited.
   Agitated saline contrast study revealed late passage of bubbles into
   the left heart consistent with probable passage via pulmonary AV
   shunting.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, presenting with right-sided weakness and blurred vision. The patient's condition is complex, and multiple medical complications are potential concerns.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with acute respiratory failure not related to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient is on BiPAP support and has a low SpO2 of 96%. The patient's pH is 7.24, indicating metabolic acidosis, and the ABG results show a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 100, indicating adequate oxygenation.

The patient's neurological status is also concerning, with right-sided weakness and altered mental status. The EEG results show slowing and disorganization of the background rhythm, but no areas of focal slowing, epileptiform discharges, or electrographic seizures were seen. The patient's MRI brain is pending.

The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, with moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, inferior akinesis, and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis. The patient's mitral and tricuspid valves are mildly thickened, and moderate mitral regurgitation is likely. The patient's pulmonary artery systolic hypertension is also concerning.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of renal failure, with a creatinine level of 3.2 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 86 mg/dL. The patient's potassium level is elevated at 4.3 mEq/L, and the patient's calcium level is slightly low at 7.8 mg/dL.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

* Renal failure, end stage (ESRD)
* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* H/O acidosis, metabolic
* H/O bradycardia
* H/O breast mass
* H/O CVA (stroke, cerebral infarction), other
* H/O hyperkalemia (high potassium, hyperpotassemia)
* H/O hypotension (not shock)

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continuing CVVH for fluid removal
* IV heparin for anticoagulation
* Midodrine 5mg po bid for hypotension
* Vanc/zosyn for infection until culture data returns
* SS insulin for diabetes
* Nutrition pending mental status start po diet

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Sepsis
* Cardiogenic shock
* Respiratory failure
* Renal failure
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Hypotension
* Bradycardia
* Metabolic acidosis
* Hyperkalemia
* Hypocalcemia
* Thrombosis

Based on the provided information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan as necessary to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   is present but was not fully assessed. There is mild pulmonary artery

   A catheter is seen in the right atrium. There is a small mobile
   echodense structure (~0.4x1.0 cm) near the junction of the SVC and
   right atrium (see cell 28) that may be adherent to catheter. This
   structure is in the same vicinity as echodense structures seen in the
   prior study of [**2145-4-2**] but fewer views were obtained so comparison is

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of right-sided weakness and altered mental status (AMS). The patient has undergone various diagnostic tests, including a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, which is pending, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) that revealed slowing and disorganization of the background rhythm, but no areas of focal slowing, epileptiform discharges, or electrographic seizures.

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, which was stopped at 5:20 PM, and is receiving BiPAP support due to drowsiness and hypercarbia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 92/61 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show renal failure, with a creatinine level of 3.2 mg/dL, and acute respiratory failure, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 100. The patient's blood glucose level is 102 mg/dL, and their calcium and magnesium levels are within normal ranges.

The patient's physical examination reveals moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, with inferior akinesis and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis. The patient also has mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's medical history is significant for a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and hyperkalemia. They have a history of acidosis, bradycardia, and breast mass.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 100, indicating acute respiratory failure. This can lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 3.2 mg/dL, indicating end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and an increased risk of infections.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's left ventricular systolic dysfunction and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's CVA and AMS can lead to further neurological deterioration, including seizures, brain edema, and increased intracranial pressure.
5. Metabolic complications: The patient's acidosis and hyperkalemia can lead to metabolic alkalosis, hyperkalemic cardiac arrest, and other metabolic derangements.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and neurological status. The patient should be managed with invasive ventilation support, and their acidosis and hyperkalemia should be aggressively treated. The patient's cardiac function should be closely monitored, and they should be considered for cardiac catheterization and potential interventions to improve their cardiac function."

   A catheter is seen in the right atrium. There is a small mobile
   echodense structure (~0.4x1.0 cm) near the junction of the SVC and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) who presented with right-sided weakness and blurred vision. The patient's condition is complex, and several potential medical complications can arise.

1. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is severely impaired, and she is on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) for fluid removal. The risk of further decline in renal function is high, and the patient may require more aggressive interventions such as dialysis or renal replacement therapy.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and has a history of acute respiratory failure. The risk of further respiratory compromise is high, especially if the patient develops pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and the echocardiogram shows moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with inferior akinesis and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis. The patient may be at risk for further cardiac compromise, including cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, or cardiac arrest.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological examination reveals facial edema, tongue enlargement, and conjunctival edema, which may be indicative of increased intracranial pressure. The patient's EEG shows abnormal slowing and disorganization of the background rhythm, which may be indicative of encephalopathy or seizures.
5. Infections: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for further infections, including sepsis, which can exacerbate her underlying conditions.
6. Metabolic Complications: The patient's acid-base status is abnormal, and she may be at risk for further metabolic derangements, including hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, or hypomagnesemia.
7. Thrombotic Complications: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and the echocardiogram shows an echodense structure in the superior vena cava (SVC) that may be a thrombus.
8. Nutritional Complications: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and she may be at risk for further malnutrition, which can exacerbate her underlying conditions.

In summary, the patient is at risk for a range of medical complications, including renal failure, respiratory failure, cardiovascular complications, neurological complications, infections, metabolic complications, thrombotic complications, and nutritional complications. Close monitoring and aggressive management of these potential complications are necessary to improve the patient's outcomes."

   is present but was not fully assessed. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension.
   A catheter is seen in the right atrium. There is a small mobile
   echodense structure (~0.4x1.0 cm) near the junction of the [**Month/Day/Year 949**] and
   right atrium (see cell 28) that may be adherent to catheter. This

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hyperkalemia, and a history of stroke. The patient is currently receiving invasive ventilation, and has been extubated. 

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 68 bpm (59-85 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 92/61 mmHg (71/50-125/79 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 96%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: Alert and oriented
* HEENT: Pupils constricted with minimal reaction to light, facial edema with tongue enlargement, and conjunctival edema
* Cardiac: Regular rhythm, 3-20 beats per minute at the left lower sternal border
* Lung: Minimal expiratory wheezes bilaterally
* Abdomen: Anasarca, obese, absent bowel sounds, and moderate distension without tenderness
* Extremities: Significant symmetric edema, bilateral lower extremity edema
* Neuro: Withdraws all four extremities to painful stimuli, pupils are constricted, but reactive

Laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 4.3 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 42.3%
* Platelet count: 83 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.2 mg/dL
* Total CO2: 22-25 mmHg
* Glucose: 86-102 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Renal failure, end stage (ESRD)
* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Acidosis, metabolic
* Bradycardia
* Breast mass
* CVA (stroke, cerebral infarction), other
* Hyperkalemia (high potassium, hyperpotassemia)
* Hypotension (not shock)

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing CVVH for fluid removal
* Discontinuing all pressors today
* Discontinuing Zosyn today as no clear evidence of infection
* Continuing midodrine 5mg po bid; considering increasing this dose instead of using pressors should BP become more tenuous
* Discussing with neuro the possible role of relative [**Name (NI) 949**] syndrome with altered mental status or poor brain perfusion
* Unclear if the echodense structure seen on ECHO is a thrombus
* Pt already anti-coagulated with IV heparin
* If any evidence of stroke, discuss with CT team

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to hypercarbia and drowsiness
* Hypotension due to metabolic derangements and medication
* Renal failure due to inadequate fluid removal
* Stroke due to the echodense structure seen on ECHO
* Infection due to the patient's history of ESRD and respiratory failure
* Acidosis due to the patient's metabolic derangements
* Bradycardia due to the patient's history of stroke and hypertension
* Breast mass due to the patient's history of breast cancer
* CVA (stroke, cerebral infarction) due to the patient's history of stroke and hypertension"

   IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal portable EEG due to slowing and

   this
   recording.
   [**2145-5-6**] MRI: pending
   [**2145-5-5**] ECHO:
   There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   inferior akinesis and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mitral
   regurgitation is probably moderate but was not fully assessed. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation
   is present but was not fully assessed. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension.
   A catheter is seen in the right atrium. There is a small mobile
   echodense structure (~0.4x1.0 cm) near the junction of the [**Month/Day/Year 949**] and
   right atrium (see cell 28) that may be adherent to catheter. This
   structure is in the same vicinity as echodense structures seen in the
   prior study of [**2145-4-2**] but fewer views were obtained so comparison is
   limited.
   Agitated saline contrast study revealed late passage of bubbles into
   the left heart consistent with probable passage via pulmonary AV
   shunting.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who presented with right-sided weakness and blurred vision. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical issues, including:

1. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been elevated, and she has been on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) for fluid removal.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient requires intermittent BiPAP for drowsiness and hypercarbia, and has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has been experiencing metabolic acidosis, which is likely related to her ESRD and respiratory failure.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, which is likely related to her metabolic derangements and medication use.
5. Facial swelling: The patient has significant facial swelling, which is likely related to her ESRD and [**Doctor Last Name 949**] stenosis.
6. Echodense structure: A small mobile echodense structure was seen on echocardiogram, which may be a thrombus or a benign finding.
7. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate has been slow, which is likely related to her ESRD and medication use.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and metabolic acidosis may be related to sepsis, which could worsen her condition.
2. Stroke: The patient's echodense structure on echocardiogram may be a thrombus that could lead to a stroke.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen if her condition is not managed effectively.
4. Metabolic derangements: The patient's metabolic acidosis and hypotension could worsen if her condition is not managed effectively.
5. Infection: The patient's history of pneumonia and the presence of a catheter may increase her risk of infection.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continuing CVVH for fluid removal.
2. Discontinuing pressors and zosyn, and considering increasing midodrine dose.
3. Managing the patient's respiratory failure with intermittent BiPAP.
4. Monitoring the patient's facial swelling and echodense structure.
5. Considering the patient's history of [**Name (NI) 949**] syndrome and the possible role of relative [**Name (NI) 949**] syndrome with altered mental status or poor brain perfusion."

   [**2145-5-6**] MRI: pending
   [**2145-5-5**] ECHO:
   There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   inferior akinesis and inferolateral akinesis/hypokinesis. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. No aortic regurgitation is
   seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mitral
   regurgitation is probably moderate but was not fully assessed. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation
   is present but was not fully assessed. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension.
   A catheter is seen in the right atrium. There is a small mobile
   echodense structure (~0.4x1.0 cm) near the junction of the SVC and
   right atrium (see cell 28) that may be adherent to catheter. This
   structure is in the same vicinity as echodense structures seen in the
   prior study of [**2145-4-2**] but fewer views were obtained so comparison is
   limited.
   Agitated saline contrast study revealed late passage of bubbles into
   the left heart consistent with probable passage via pulmonary AV
   shunting.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   regurgitation is probably moderate but was not fully assessed. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Tricuspid regurgitation
   is present but was not fully assessed. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension.
   A catheter is seen in the right atrium. There is a small mobile
   echodense structure (~0.4x1.0 cm) near the junction of the SVC and
   right atrium (see cell 28) that may be adherent to catheter. This
   structure is in the same vicinity as echodense structures seen in the
   prior study of [**2145-4-2**] but fewer views were obtained so comparison is
   limited.
   Agitated saline contrast study revealed late passage of bubbles into
   the left heart consistent with probable passage via pulmonary AV
   shunting.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, presenting with right-sided weakness and altered mental status (AMS). She has a history of stroke, seizures, and cardiac issues. The patient has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 68 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 92/61 mmHg. She is on invasive ventilation and has been extubated. She is receiving Norepinephrine and Heparin infusions.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 4.3 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 42.3%
* Platelet count: 83 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 23 mg/dL
* Glucose: 102 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.4 mmol/L
* Calcium: 7.8 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.5 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes:

* ESRD on hemodialysis
* Stroke
* Seizures
* Cardiac issues (aortic valve disease, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation)
* Breast mass
* CVA (stroke)
* Hyperkalemia
* Hypotension
* Facial swelling (due to SVC narrowing)

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing CVVH for fluid removal
* Continuing antibiotics (Vanc and Zosyn) for now until culture data returns
* Monitoring for sepsis and cardiogenic shock
* Continuing midodrine 5mg po bid
* Following up with neurology and cardiology teams
* Considering further imaging studies (MRI and echocardiogram) to rule out stroke and cardiac issues
* Managing metabolic derangements and acidosis
* Monitoring for signs of worsening respiratory failure and adjusting ventilation accordingly

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she may require further ventilation or respiratory support.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac history and current status make her susceptible to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen, leading to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
* Infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central venous catheters make her susceptible to infections, such as sepsis or catheter-related infections.
* Metabolic derangements: The patient's acidosis and electrolyte imbalances require close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
* Stroke: The patient's history of stroke and current neurological symptoms make her at risk for further stroke or transient ischemic attacks.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac history and current status make her susceptible to cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, presenting with right-sided weakness and blurred vision. The patient has a history of acidosis, bradycardia, breast mass, CVA (stroke), and hyperkalemia.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 79 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 102/62 mmHg. The patient is receiving intermittent BiPAP for respiratory failure and is awake and alert. The patient's peripheral vascular examination is incomplete due to the lack of assessment.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 2.6 K/uL
* Hct: 41.1%
* Plt: 82 K/uL
* Cr: 2.1 mg/dL
* TCO2: 25 mmHg
* Glucose: 73 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 14.5/107.3/1.3, Differential-Neuts: 77.5%, Band: 0.0%, Lymph: 14.6%, Mono: 6.5%, Eos: 0.7%, Lactic Acid: 1.4 mmol/L, Ca++: 8.2 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL, PO4: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing CVVH for fluid removal
* Discontinuing all pressors today
* Discontinuing Zosyn today as no clear evidence of infection
* Continuing midodrine 5mg po bid
* Considering increasing midodrine dose instead of using pressors
* Continuing IV heparin for anticoagulation
* Monitoring for signs of stroke or thrombus
* Discussing possible role of relative [**Name (NI) 949**] syndrome with altered mental status or poor brain perfusion
* Starting po diet pending mental status
* Monitoring for signs of DVT and stress ulcer

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition and treatment include:

* Renal failure progression
* Respiratory failure worsening
* Acidosis worsening
* Hyperkalemia worsening
* Bradycardia worsening
* Hypotension worsening
* Thrombus formation
* Stroke or CVA
* Infection (e.g., sepsis)
* Metabolic derangements (e.g., hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia)
* Electrolyte imbalance (e.g., hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia)

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or minimize these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) presenting with right-sided weakness and blurred vision. She has been experiencing lethargy, facial swelling, and hypotension. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being treated with metoprolol.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires intermittent BiPAP for drowsiness and hypercarbia, suggesting obesity hypoventilation syndrome. This increases the risk of respiratory failure and requires close monitoring.
2. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with yeast, which may lead to sepsis and organ failure if not properly treated.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being treated with metoprolol. The first-degree AV block on her ECG may indicate a risk of cardiac arrhythmias or conduction abnormalities.
4. Renal Complications: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction. This may lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease if not properly managed.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's right-sided weakness and blurred vision may indicate a neurological complication such as a stroke or seizures. The MRI and EEG results are negative, but further evaluation is necessary to rule out any underlying neurological condition.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's facial swelling and hypotension may indicate gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction, which requires further evaluation and management.
7. Metabolic Complications: The patient's diabetes mellitus (DM) requires close monitoring and management to prevent metabolic complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and medical status closely to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) presenting with right-sided weakness and blurred vision. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure of 77/46 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 2.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.1 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) of 82. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.0 mEq/L. 

The patient's medical history is significant for ESRD, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) and has a central venous catheter (CVC) for hemodialysis. 

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Blurred vision and right-sided weakness: Negative MRI and EEG, and no seizure activity. 
* Facial swelling: likely related to known stenosis and volume overload.
* Hypotension: BP stable at baseline, and Cxs remain negative except for urine with yeast. Continue midodrine 10mg po bid, and follow up with blood and urine Cxs.
* ESRD: CVVH DC, and restart HD.
* Respiratory failure: Pt remains awake and alert, requiring intermittent BiPAP for drowsiness and hypercarbia. 
* Facial swelling: likely related to known stenosis. Discuss with neuro the possible role of relative syndrome with altered mental status or poor brain perfusion.
* Echodense structure: seen on ECHO, stable from last ECHO.
* DM: SS insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of ESRD, leading to further decline in kidney function.
* Development of sepsis due to the UTI and CVC.
* Respiratory failure, leading to the need for mechanical ventilation.
* Cardiovascular instability, including hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias.
* Neurological deterioration, including altered mental status or poor brain perfusion.
* Infection, including pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
* Fluid overload, leading to worsening of facial swelling and respiratory failure."
