   Hcts 21->27.9 after 2 units. Received 1 more unit and hct 27.6 but
   checked while going in so will need repeat this am.
   Sgy is following as concern for developing toxic megacolon as well as
   may need colectomy depending on results of the scope. Suggested
   starting Cipro.
 CHEST PAIN - At [**2142-9-29**] 02:20 AM
   Drank 50% of golytely. Then, pt OOB to commode. Stated feeling
   nauseous. Had syncopal event without LOC. Was helped to knees by RN.
   did not hit head. Was able to be helped back into bed. Complained of
   CP. EKG done.
    -> no change from prior. Enzymes sent. 2units pRBCs and 500 mL NS
   infused with return of SBPs to120s and resolution of CP. Called GI to
   ask if should continue golytely. Can put down NGT if can
t tolerate PO
   but after 4mg zofran could tolerate PO golytely and had no further
   episodes of syncope or CP.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare.
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused a total of 5 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable now after syncopal episode. BMs still
   bloody on golytely.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient, a 37-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the setting of an active ulcerative colitis (UC) flare. The patient has received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and remains hemodynamically stable. The patient has experienced a syncopal episode and has been started on Ciprofloxacin for potential toxic megacolon.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.4 g/dL, a hematocrit (Hct) of 27.6%, and a white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.0 K/uL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.3 mEq/L.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, a heart rate of 65 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 108/49 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a slightly tender abdomen, particularly in the left lower quadrant, and a swollen right knee. The patient's neurologic examination is normal.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Serial hemoglobin checks every 6 hours and transfusion to a hematocrit of 30.
2. Continued treatment of ulcerative colitis, including IV steroids, PPI, and Flagyl.
3. Colonoscopy tomorrow to evaluate the extent of the colitis and potential complications.
4. Zofran for nausea.
5. Surgery following colonoscopy to evaluate for toxic megacolon.
6. Serial exams for toxic megacolon.
7. Maintenance fluids and electrolyte repletion as needed.
8. Pneumoboots and Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis due to prolonged steroid use.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Toxic megacolon: A life-threatening complication of UC characterized by a dilated colon that can lead to bowel obstruction, perforation, and peritonitis.
2. Colonic perforation: A potentially life-threatening complication of UC that can lead to peritonitis and sepsis.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, may become abnormal due to the use of diuretics, steroids, and other medications.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections, particularly Clostridioides difficile (C. diff), due to the use of antibiotics and the patient's underlying inflammatory state.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at increased risk for DVT due to his inflammatory state and prolonged immobility.
6. Pulmonary embolism (PE): A potentially life-threatening complication of DVT that can lead to respiratory failure and death.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's underlying inflammatory state may increase his risk for cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare.
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused a total of 5 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable now after syncopal episode. BMs still
   bloody on golytely.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis.
   - f/u serial Hcts Q6H, transfuse to Hct of 30
   - continue treatment of ulcerative colitis as below
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - PPI IV BID
   - Colonoscopy today once finishes golytel  given continued GI bleed and
   falling HCT.
   - zofran for nausea
   - Surgery following and doing serial exams for toxic megacolon.
   .
   #. UC flare. Pt admitted with UC flare that began 6 weeks prior to
   admission. Now on IV steroids and flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
   - continue Asacol and enemas for now
   - continue IV steroids
   - continue Flagyl until C.diff negative x 3

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   24 Hour Events:
   Hcts 21->27.9 after 2 units. Received 1 more unit and hct 27.6 but
   checked while going in so will need repeat this am.
   Sgy is following as concern for developing toxic megacolon as well as
   may need colectomy depending on results of the scope. Suggested
   starting Cipro.
 CHEST PAIN - At [**2142-9-29**] 02:20 AM
   Drank 50% of golytely. Then, pt OOB to commode. Stated feeling
   nauseous. Had syncopal event without LOC. Was helped to knees by RN.
   did not hit head. Was able to be helped back into bed. Complained of
   CP. EKG done.
    -> no change from prior. Enzymes sent. 2units pRBCs and 500 mL NS
   infused with return of SBPs to120s and resolution of CP. Called GI to
   ask if should continue golytely. Can put down NGT if can

Summary:

The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of active ulcerative colitis (UC) who presented with a lower GI bleed, resulting in a syncopal episode. He has received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and remains hemodynamically stable. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) has increased from 21% to 27.6% after transfusions. He has also developed toxic megacolon and may require a colectomy. The patient's medications include pantoprazole, zofran, and ciprofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Toxic Megacolon: The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension increase the risk of toxic megacolon, which can lead to sepsis, shock, and even death.
2. Colectomy: The patient's UC flare and toxic megacolon may require a colectomy, which carries risks such as bleeding, infection, and bowel obstruction.
3. Sepsis: The patient's immunosuppressed state and GI bleeding increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
4. DVT: The patient's swollen right knee and inflammatory state increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and prolonged steroid use increase the risk of infection, including C. difficile colitis, pneumonia, and other opportunistic infections.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's diarrhea and vomiting increase the risk of electrolyte imbalance, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications.
7. Nausea and Vomiting: The patient's symptoms of nausea and vomiting increase the risk of dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and malnutrition.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a complex medical condition. The patient's hemoglobin level has increased from 21 to 27.9 after receiving two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). The patient is at risk of developing toxic megacolon and may require a colectomy, for which Ciprofloxacin has been suggested.

The patient experienced a syncopal event without loss of consciousness (LOC) while trying to use the commode, which was accompanied by nausea and chest pain. The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) showed no changes, and enzymes were sent for analysis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.4°F (36.9°C), heart rate of 65 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 108/49 mmHg. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has a fluid balance of 1,300 mL over the past 24 hours.

Laboratory results show an increase in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, while creatinine and troponin levels are within normal limits. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are slightly elevated, and electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Toxic megacolon: The patient is at risk of developing toxic megacolon, which can lead to severe complications, including perforation, abscess formation, and sepsis.
2. Colectomy: The patient may require a colectomy, which carries risks such as surgical complications, bleeding, and infection.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's syncopal event and chest pain may indicate cardiac involvement, which could lead to arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but they may be at risk of developing respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, due to their underlying medical condition and the use of respiratory support.
5. Infection: The patient's increased white blood cell count and elevated LFTs may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's coagulopathy and increased platelet count may increase their risk of bleeding complications, particularly if they undergo a colectomy or other invasive procedures."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare.
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused atotal of 4 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable, but still having bloody BMs and is
   orthostatic.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis.
   - f/u serial Hcts Q6H, transfuse to Hct of 23
   - continue treatment of ulcerative colitis as below
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - PPI IV BID
   - Colonoscopy tomorrow given continued GI bleed and falling HCT.
   Go-lytely prep started on floor, zofran for nausea
   - Surgery following.
   .
   #. UC flare. Pt admitted with UC flare that began 6 weeks prior to
   admission. Now on IV steroids and flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
   - continue Asacol and enemas for now
   - continue IV steroids
   - continue Flagyl until C.diff negative x 3
   - appreciate GI recs
   - NPO for now  except meds
   .
   #. Leukocytosis. Pt admitted with WBC 19, likely secondary to steroids
   but will rule out GI infections.
   - obtain C.diff stool samples, stool cultures, stool O&P
   - continue empiric IV Flagyl for C.diff coverage

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare.
   .
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused atotal of 4 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable, but still having bloody BMs and is
   orthostatic.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis.
   - f/u serial Hcts Q6H, transfuse to Hct of 23
   - continue treatment of ulcerative colitis as below
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - PPI IV BID
   - Colonoscopy tomorrow given continued GI bleed and falling HCT.
   Go-lytely prep started on floor, zofran for nausea
   - Surgery following.
   .
   #. UC flare. Pt admitted with UC flare that began 6 weeks prior to
   admission. Now on IV steroids and flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
   - continue Asacol and enemas for now
   - continue IV steroids
   - continue Flagyl until C.diff negative x 3
   - appreciate GI recs
   - NPO for now  except meds
   .
   #. Leukocytosis. Pt admitted with WBC 19, likely secondary to steroids
   but will rule out GI infections.
   - obtain C.diff stool samples, stool cultures, stool O&P
   - continue empiric IV Flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - follow up blood cultures
   .
   #. Swollen right knee - Pt p/w swollen right knee, believed to be
   extra-colonic manifestation of UC. Also consider DVT as pt is at
   increased risk for DVT given his overall inflammatory state. LENI was
   negative.
   .
   #. FEN - NPO except meds, replete lytes PRN

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with lower GI bleed in the setting of active ulcerative colitis (UC) flare. The patient has been transfused with a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and remains hemodynamically stable.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb) levels: 9.4 g/dL (increased from 7.2 g/dL)
* Hematocrit (Hct) levels: 27.6% (increased from 24.1%)
* White blood cell (WBC) count: 15.0 x 10^9/L (increased from 12.8 x 10^9/L)
* Platelet count: 324 x 10^9/L (increased from 244 x 10^9/L)
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 25 mEq/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.9 mg/dL
* Glucose: 94 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 65 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 108/49 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Orthostatic hypotension
* Bloody bowel movements
* Swollen right knee

The patient's medical history is significant for active UC flare, which began 6 weeks prior to admission. The patient is currently receiving treatment for UC, including IV steroids, Flagyl, and Asacol.

Potential medical complications that may arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Toxic megacolon
* Colonic perforation
* Sepsis
* Leukocytosis
* Thrombocytopenia
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Hypovolemic shock
* DVT

The patient's plan includes:

* Serial Hct monitoring and transfusion to a Hct of 23
* Continued treatment of UC with IV steroids, Flagyl, and Asacol
* Colonoscopy tomorrow to evaluate the extent of colonic damage
* PPI IV BID for prophylaxis against GI bleeding
* Go-lytely prep started on the floor for colonoscopy
* Zofran for nausea
* Surgery following colonoscopy if necessary

The patient's code status is full code, and he is being transferred to the MICU for colonoscopy tomorrow."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare. Interestingly, colonscopy yesterday was more consistent with
   colonic Crohn's disease.
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused a total of 9 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable now after syncopal episode. BMs still
   bloody on golytely.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis. Colonscopy showed a
   single lesion in the transverse colon without continuous lesions more
   consistent with CD than UC.
   - f/u serial Hcts Q6H, transfuse to Hct of 30
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - PPI IV BID
   - zofran for nausea
   - Surgery following and doing serial exams for toxic megacolon.
   #. UC flare. Pt admitted with UC flare that began 6 weeks prior to
   admission. Now on IV steroids and flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
   Of note, underlying disease may be CD, but this does not change the
   management for now
   - continue IV steroids
   - continue Flagyl until C.diff negative x 3
   - appreciate GI recs
   - Clear liquids
   #. Leukocytosis. Pt admitted with WBC 19, likely secondary to steroids
   but will rule out GI infections.
   - obtain C.diff stool samples, stool cultures, stool O&P
   - continue empiric IV Flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - follow up blood cultures
   #. Swollen right knee - Pt p/w swollen right knee, believed to be
   extra-colonic manifestation of UC. Also consider DVT as pt is at
   increased risk for DVT given his overall inflammatory state. LENI was
   negative.
   #. Hyperglycemia: Likely [**3-17**] steroids. will check FS daily. No
   treatment now esp since NPO.
   #. Chest pain: Possibly MS, but could be cardiac given blood loss. MI
   ruled out with ECG and CEs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare. Interestingly, colonscopy yesterday was more consistent with
   colonic Crohn's disease.
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused a total of 9 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable now after syncopal episode. BMs still
   bloody on golytely.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis. Colonscopy showed a
   single lesion in the transverse colon without continuous lesions more
   consistent with CD than UC.
   - f/u serial Hcts Q6H, transfuse to Hct of 30
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - PPI IV BID
   - zofran for nausea
   - Surgery following and doing serial exams for toxic megacolon.
   #. UC flare. Pt admitted with UC flare that began 6 weeks prior to
   admission. Now on IV steroids and flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
   Of note, underlying disease may be CD, but this does not change the
   management for now
   - continue IV steroids
   - continue Flagyl until C.diff negative x 3
   - appreciate GI recs
   - Clear liquids
   #. Leukocytosis. Pt admitted with WBC 19, likely secondary to steroids
   but will rule out GI infections.
   - obtain C.diff stool samples, stool cultures, stool O&P
   - continue empiric IV Flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - follow up blood cultures
   #. Swollen right knee - Pt p/w swollen right knee, believed to be
   extra-colonic manifestation of UC. Also consider DVT as pt is at
   increased risk for DVT given his overall inflammatory state. LENI was
   negative.
   #. Hyperglycemia: Likely [**3-17**] steroids. will check FS daily. No
   treatment now esp since NPO.
   #. Chest pain: Possibly MS, but could be cardiac given blood loss. MI
   ruled out with ECG and CEs

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) who presented with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has been transfused with 9 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and remains hemodynamically stable. The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level has been falling, and he has been transfused with pRBCs to maintain a hemoglobin level of 30.

The patient underwent a colonoscopy, which showed a single lesion in the transverse colon, consistent with Crohn's disease (CD) rather than UC. The patient has been diagnosed with a UC flare and is being treated with IV steroids and flagyl. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, likely due to the steroids, and stool cultures and C. difficile stool samples are pending.

The patient has also been experiencing symptoms of hyperglycemia, likely due to the steroids, and will be monitored closely for this. The patient has a swollen right knee, which is believed to be an extra-colonic manifestation of UC, and will be monitored for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's ongoing bleeding and low hemoglobin level increase the risk of further bleeding complications.
2. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to the steroids and flagyl increases the risk of infection, particularly C. difficile.
3. DVT: The patient's increased risk for DVT due to his inflammatory state and immobility increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis.
4. Toxic megacolon: The patient's UC flare and ongoing inflammation increase the risk of toxic megacolon, which can be life-threatening.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's blood loss and dehydration increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias and heart failure.
6. Nutritional complications: The patient's inability to tolerate food due to his UC flare and ongoing bleeding increases the risk of nutritional deficiencies.
7. Psychiatric complications: The patient's ongoing symptoms and immobility can increase the risk of depression and anxiety.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue IV steroids and flagyl for the UC flare.
2. Monitor the patient's WBC count and stool cultures for signs of infection.
3. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin level and transfuse as needed to maintain a level of 30.
4. Monitor the patient's right knee for signs of DVT and consider prophylactic anticoagulation.
5. Monitor the patient's glucose level and adjust treatment as needed to prevent hyperglycemia.
6. Consider surgical intervention for toxic megacolon.
7. Provide close monitoring and supportive care to manage the patient's symptoms and prevent complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare. Interestingly, colonscopy yesterday was more consistent with
   colonic Crohn's disease.
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused a total of 9 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable now after syncopal episode. BMs still
   bloody on golytely.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis. Colonscopy showed a
   single lesion in the transverse colon without continuous lesions more
   consistent with CD than UC.
   - f/u serial Hcts Q6H, transfuse to Hct of 30
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - PPI IV BID
   - zofran for nausea
   - Surgery following and doing serial exams for toxic megacolon.
   #. UC flare. Pt admitted with UC flare that began 6 weeks prior to
   admission. Now on IV steroids and flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
   Of note, underlying disease may be CD, but this does not change the
   management for now
   - continue IV steroids
   - continue Flagyl until C.diff negative x 3
   - appreciate GI recs
   - Clear liquids
   #. Leukocytosis. Pt admitted with WBC 19, likely secondary to steroids
   but will rule out GI infections.
   - obtain C.diff stool samples, stool cultures, stool O&P
   - continue empiric IV Flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - follow up blood cultures
   #. Swollen right knee - Pt p/w swollen right knee, believed to be
   extra-colonic manifestation of UC. Also consider DVT as pt is at
   increased risk for DVT given his overall inflammatory state. LENI was
   negative.
   #. Hyperglycemia: Likely [**3-17**] steroids. will check FS daily. No
   treatment now esp since NPO.
   #. Chest pain: Possibly MS, but could be cardiac given blood loss. MI
   ruled out with ECG and CEs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 37-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a lower GI bleed in the setting of active ulcerative colitis (UC) flare. The patient presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel movements, and has been transfused a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient remains hemodynamically stable after a syncopal episode.

The patient underwent an emergent colonoscopy, which showed a single lesion in the transverse colon, consistent with Crohn's disease (CD) rather than UC. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5, which responded to IV vitamin K.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 15.0 x 10^9/L. The patient's blood glucose level is 248 mg/dL, which may be related to steroid use. The patient's cardiac enzymes are normal, and the patient is being monitored for potential cardiac complications.

The patient's abdominal examination is notable for moderate tenderness in the right lower quadrant, without masses or hernias. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Bleeding: The patient's lower GI bleed may continue to worsen, requiring further transfusions and potential surgical intervention.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may be related to an underlying infection, such as Clostridioides difficile (C. diff), which needs to be ruled out.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's blood loss and underlying inflammatory state may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's abnormal INR may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly in the setting of further blood loss.
5. Toxic megacolon: The patient's underlying UC flare and potential CD may increase the risk of toxic megacolon, which requires close monitoring and potential surgical intervention.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's inflammatory state and immobility may increase the risk of DVT, which needs to be monitored and potentially treated.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level may continue to rise, requiring close monitoring and potential treatment.

The patient's plan includes serial hematocrit measurements, transfusions to maintain a hematocrit of 30%, and ongoing monitoring of his respiratory, cardiac, and gastrointestinal status. The patient's medication regimen includes proton pump inhibitors, antinausea medication, and empiric IV Flagyl for C. diff coverage."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare. Interestingly, colonscopy yesterday was more consistent with
   colonic Crohn's disease.
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused a total of 9 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable now after syncopal episode. BMs still
   bloody on golytely.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis. Colonscopy showed a
   single lesion in the transverse colon without continuous lesions more
   consistent with CD than UC.
   - f/u serial Hcts Q6H, transfuse to Hct of 30
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - PPI IV BID
   - zofran for nausea
   - Surgery following and doing serial exams for toxic megacolon.
   #. UC flare. Pt admitted with UC flare that began 6 weeks prior to
   admission. Now on IV steroids and flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
   Of note, underlying disease may be CD, but this does not change the
   management for now
   - continue IV steroids
   - continue Flagyl until C.diff negative x 3
   - appreciate GI recs
   - Clear liquids
   #. Leukocytosis. Pt admitted with WBC 19, likely secondary to steroids
   but will rule out GI infections.
   - obtain C.diff stool samples, stool cultures, stool O&P
   - continue empiric IV Flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - follow up blood cultures
   #. Swollen right knee - Pt p/w swollen right knee, believed to be
   extra-colonic manifestation of UC. Also consider DVT as pt is at
   increased risk for DVT given his overall inflammatory state. LENI was
   negative.
   #. Hyperglycemia: Likely [**3-17**] steroids. will check FS daily. No
   treatment now esp since NPO.
   #. Chest pain: Possibly MS, but could be cardiac given blood loss. MI
   ruled out with ECG and CEs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 4385**] is a 37 yo male with lower GI bleed in setting of active UC
   flare. Interestingly, colonscopy yesterday was more consistent with
   colonic Crohn's disease.
   #. Lower GI bleed. Pt presented with 3-4 days of multiple bloody bowel
   movements. He has been transfused a total of 9 units of PRBCs and
   remains hemodynamically stable now after syncopal episode. BMs still
   bloody on golytely.  CT abd/pelvis showed colitis. Colonscopy showed a
   single lesion in the transverse colon without continuous lesions more
   consistent with CD than UC.
   - f/u serial Hcts Q6H, transfuse to Hct of 30
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - PPI IV BID
   - zofran for nausea
   - Surgery following and doing serial exams for toxic megacolon.
   #. UC flare. Pt admitted with UC flare that began 6 weeks prior to
   admission. Now on IV steroids and flagyl with symptomatic improvement.
   Of note, underlying disease may be CD, but this does not change the
   management for now
   - continue IV steroids
   - continue Flagyl until C.diff negative x 3
   - appreciate GI recs
   - Clear liquids
   #. Leukocytosis. Pt admitted with WBC 19, likely secondary to steroids
   but will rule out GI infections.
   - obtain C.diff stool samples, stool cultures, stool O&P
   - continue empiric IV Flagyl for C.diff coverage
   - follow up blood cultures
   #. Swollen right knee - Pt p/w swollen right knee, believed to be
   extra-colonic manifestation of UC. Also consider DVT as pt is at
   increased risk for DVT given his overall inflammatory state. LENI was
   negative.
   #. Hyperglycemia: Likely [**3-17**] steroids. will check FS daily. No
   treatment now esp since NPO.
   #. Chest pain: Possibly MS, but could be cardiac given blood loss. MI
   ruled out with ECG and CEs

Summary:

The patient, a 37-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with a lower GI bleed in the setting of an active ulcerative colitis (UC) flare. The patient presented with 3-4 days of bloody bowel movements and has been transfused a total of 9 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level has continued to fall despite transfusions, and he remains hemodynamically stable. A colonoscopy was performed, which showed a single lesion in the transverse colon, more consistent with Crohn's disease (CD) than UC.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Coagulopathy: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.5, and he has responded to IV vitamin K.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is 19, likely secondary to steroids, but will be ruled out for GI infections.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is 248 mg/dL, likely secondary to steroids.
4. Swollen right knee: The patient has a swollen right knee, which is believed to be an extra-colonic manifestation of UC. DVT is also a concern given the patient's inflammatory state.
5. Chest pain: The patient has chest pain, which could be due to myocardial infarction (MI) or musculoskeletal (MS) syndrome.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Serial Hcts every 6 hours, with transfusion to an Hct of 30.
2. PPI IV BID.
3. Zofran for nausea.
4. Surgery following and serial exams for toxic megacolon.
5. Continue IV steroids.
6. Continue Flagyl until C. diff negative x 3.
7. Obtain C. diff stool samples, stool cultures, and stool O&P.
8. Continue empiric IV Flagyl for C. diff coverage.
9. Follow up blood cultures.

Potential medical complications:

1. Further bleeding: The patient's GI bleed may continue, leading to further blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and hyperglycemia may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen his condition.
3. DVT: The patient's swollen right knee and inflammatory state make DVT a concern.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's chest pain and hyperglycemia may indicate cardiac complications, such as MI or cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Toxic megacolon: The patient's underlying UC flare and colonic Crohn's disease may lead to toxic megacolon, which could worsen his condition.
6. C. diff colitis: The patient's C. diff infection may worsen his condition and lead to complications such as colitis and sepsis."
