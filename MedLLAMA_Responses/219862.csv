   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA arrest: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From family
   history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day. This could
   be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be exacerbated by
   patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could hypothesize that
   patient took additional narcotics which depressed his already-tenuous
   respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia which led to PEA
   arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on admit not
   necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - support respiratory failure as below
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - treat other issues as below
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related to
   profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia. Following
   aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on arrival
   to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source (did have
   leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source is
   infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac function
   (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less suspicion
   for cardiac shock.
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   - send sputum culture
   - add on urine legionella antigen
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now (? heparin allergy)
   .
   # ACcess: R IJ CVL, right radial arterial line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source is
   infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac function
   (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less suspicion
   for cardiac shock.
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   - send sputum culture
   - add on urine legionella antigen
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and tracheobronchomalacia, who presented to the ICU following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has a history of chronic hypercarbia, which may have contributed to the arrest.

Current medical issues:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires mechanical ventilation. He has a history of sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia, and recurrent pneumonias, which may have contributed to his respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a PEA arrest, and the underlying cause is unclear. Cardiac enzymes are being cycled, and the patient is being treated for shock.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine is unknown, but it is likely to be higher due to shock and arrest. Renal function is being monitored, and medications are being renally dosed.
4. Hypertension: The patient was on multiple pressors on arrival to the ICU, which were quickly weaned off. His blood pressure is currently being monitored with an arterial line.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar is being monitored and controlled with insulin.
6. Chronic pain: The patient is being reassessed for chronic pain, and narcotics are being withheld until his mental status improves.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient may develop further respiratory failure due to his underlying conditions and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient may develop cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure, due to his history of atrial fibrillation and the recent cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate due to shock and arrest, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent pneumonias and is at risk for further infections, particularly in the setting of chronic hypercarbia and respiratory failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient may develop neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, due to his history of cardiac arrest and the need for mechanical ventilation.
6. Sepsis: The patient may develop sepsis due to his underlying infections and the need for mechanical ventilation.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator settings as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's cardiac arrest and monitor cardiac enzymes.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medications as needed.
4. Continue to control the patient's blood sugar and hypertension.
5. Reassess the patient's chronic pain and consider alternative pain management options.
6. Consider sending sputum cultures and urine legionella antigen to rule out underlying infections.
7. Obtain records from the patient's primary care physician to establish a baseline creatinine level.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and consider imaging studies to rule out underlying neurological complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who suffered a PEA arrest and was successfully resuscitated. The patient is currently receiving invasive ventilation, arterial line, and multi-lumen catheter placement.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.9°C (98.5°F)
* Heart rate: 75 beats per minute (58-75 beats per minute)
* Blood pressure: 121/73 mmHg (93-160/81 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 24 breaths per minute (21-28 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: AV paced

The patient has a trach stent for tracheomalacia and had difficulty intubation. They are receiving dopamine, levophed, and epi to support their blood pressure.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 24.5
* Hematocrit: 36.8
* Platelet count: 231
* Creatinine: 2.3
* Troponin-T: 0.06
* Lactic acid: 3.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.5 g/dL
* LDH: 224 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.1 mg/dL

The patient's respiratory support includes invasive ventilation with a peak inspiratory pressure of 35 cmH2O and a plateau pressure of 27 cmH2O. They are receiving 50% FiO2 and have a respiratory system compliance of 29.5 cmH2O/mL.

The patient's abdominal examination is not assessed, and their peripheral vascular examination is limited due to the presence of femoral lines. Their skin, neurologic, and musculoskeletal examinations are also not assessed.

The patient has a diagnosis of altered mental status, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. They are receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: Prolonged mechanical ventilation can lead to ventilator-associated lung injury, pneumonia, and respiratory muscle weakness.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest may be a sign of underlying cardiac disease, and they may be at risk for future cardiac events.
* Infection: The patient's invasive lines and catheters increase their risk of infection, and they may be at risk for sepsis and multi-organ failure.
* Neurologic complications: The patient's altered mental status may be a sign of underlying neurologic disease, and they may be at risk for neurologic complications such as seizures, stroke, or brain edema.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be sufficient to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding, and they may be at risk for gastrointestinal complications such as perforation or abscess.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA arrest: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From family
   history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day. This could
   be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be exacerbated by
   patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could hypothesize that
   patient took additional narcotics which depressed his already-tenuous
   respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia which led to PEA
   arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on admit not
   necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - support respiratory failure as below
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - treat other issues as below
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related to
   profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia. Following
   aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on arrival
   to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source (did have
   leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source is
   infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac function
   (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less suspicion
   for cardiac shock.
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   - send sputum culture
   - add on urine legionella antigen
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now (? heparin allergy)
   .
   # ACcess: R IJ CVL, left radial arterial line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA arrest: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From family
   history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day. This could
   be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be exacerbated by
   patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could hypothesize that
   patient took additional narcotics which depressed his already-tenuous
   respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia which led to PEA
   arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on admit not
   necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - support respiratory failure as below
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - treat other issues as below
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related to
   profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia. Following
   aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on arrival
   to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source (did have
   leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source is
   infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac function
   (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less suspicion
   for cardiac shock.
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   - send sputum culture
   - add on urine legionella antigen
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now (? heparin allergy)
   .
   # ACcess: R IJ CVL, left radial arterial line

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and tracheobronchomalacia, who presented to the ICU after a PEA arrest. He was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, and has been receiving multiple medications, including dopamine, epinephrine, and levophed. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.5°F, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 121/73 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 24.5
* Hct: 36.8
* Plt: 231
* Cr: 2.3
* TropT: 0.06
* TCO2: 25
* Glucose: [**Telephone/Fax (3) 4286**]
* Other labs: PT / PTT / INR: 13.6/25.9/1.2, CK / CKMB / Troponin-T: 1084/11/0.09, ALT / AST: 36/46, Alk Phos / T Bili: 88/0.4, Differential-Neuts: 95.8 %, Band: 21.0 %, Lymph: 2.1 %, Mono: 1.8 %, Eos: 0.2 %, Lactic Acid: 3.0 mmol/L, Albumin: 3.5 g/dL, LDH: 224 IU/L, Ca++: 7.9 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL, PO4: 2.1 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Cardiac arrest
* Renal insufficiency
* Hypertension
* Hypercholesterolemia
* Chronic pain
* Altered mental status (not delirium)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to underlying pulmonary issues, such as tracheobronchomalacia and sleep apnea
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or infarction, given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent cardiac arrest
* Renal insufficiency, which may worsen due to underlying conditions or medications
* Hypertension, which may require further management
* Hypercholesterolemia, which may require reinitiation of statin therapy
* Chronic pain, which may require ongoing management
* Altered mental status, which may require ongoing monitoring and management

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Support for respiratory failure
* Cycle cardiac enzymes
* Treat other issues, such as shock and renal insufficiency
* Continually reassess neurologic status
* Monitor blood pressure with arterial line
* Treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime and vancomycin
* Send sputum culture
* Repeat lactate
* Trend creatinine
* Renally dose meds
* Avoid nephrotoxins
* Obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
* Cycle CKs to peak
* EKG in AM
* Monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control
* Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor requirement on arrival
* Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized
* Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient taking POs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA arrest: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From family
   history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day. This could
   be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be exacerbated by
   patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could hypothesize that
   patient took additional narcotics which depressed his already-tenuous
   respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia which led to PEA
   arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on admit not
   necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - support respiratory failure as below
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - treat other issues as below
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related to
   profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia. Following
   aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on arrival
   to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source (did have
   leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source is
   infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac function
   (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less suspicion
   for cardiac shock.
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   - send sputum culture
   - add on urine legionella antigen
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now (? heparin allergy)

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # PEA arrest: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From family
   history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day. This could
   be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be exacerbated by
   patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could hypothesize that
   patient took additional narcotics which depressed his already-tenuous
   respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia which led to PEA
   arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on admit not
   necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - support respiratory failure as below
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - treat other issues as below
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related to
   profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia. Following
   aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on arrival
   to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source (did have
   leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source is
   infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac function
   (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less suspicion
   for cardiac shock.
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   - send sputum culture
   - add on urine legionella antigen
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now (? heparin allergy)
   .
   # ACcess: R IJ CVL, right radial arterial line

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting. He was admitted to the ICU after a PEA arrest, and the circumstances surrounding the arrest are unclear.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is on a ventilator with a respiratory rate of 14 and a tidal volume of 501 mL. His arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.37, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) of 44 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) of 262 mmHg.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient had a PEA arrest, and his cardiac enzymes are being monitored.
* Shock: The patient's blood pressure is unstable, and he is receiving vasopressors.
* Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and his urine output is decreased.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, and he is receiving insulin therapy.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and he is receiving antihypertensive medication.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen, leading to increased oxygen requirements, respiratory acidosis, and pulmonary edema.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest can recur, leading to further deterioration of his cardiac function and increased risk of mortality.
3. Shock: The patient's shock can worsen, leading to decreased perfusion of vital organs, including the kidneys, liver, and brain.
4. Renal insufficiency: The patient's renal insufficiency can worsen, leading to further increase in creatinine levels, decreased urine output, and increased risk of acute kidney injury.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia can worsen, leading to increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, and increased risk of infections.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension can worsen, leading to increased risk of cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac arrhythmias.
7. Infections: The patient is at risk of developing infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis, which can worsen his condition and increase his risk of mortality.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which can worsen his condition and increase his risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his respiratory, cardiac, renal, and metabolic functions to prevent these potential complications and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
 currently on PSV wean, will
   keep on vent with plan to diurese today, wean in Am tomorrow with
   extubation on [**12-22**]
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting - obtained
   - send sputum culture
 if available
   - add on urine legionella antigen - negative
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
 improving as of [**12-21**]
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
 obtained
   will eval for baseline renal fxn
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - pressures remain stable off pressors
   - this AM pt had misfiring of pacemaker
 EP will interrogate in AM
   - support respiratory failure as below
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
 no acute changes in levels
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related to
   profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia. Following
   aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on arrival
   to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source (did have
   leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source is
   infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac function
   (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less suspicion
   for cardiac shock.
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   - pressures stable
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 will start Lantus 15 [**Hospital1 7**], will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.  Stabilized started BP medications
   - started Labetalol and Hydral
   - once PO plan is to restart home meds
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting. He presented in cardiac arrest and was resuscitated.

Current status:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated with a respiratory rate of 92 and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 262. He has a history of sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia, and recurrent pneumonias.
* Renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine is unclear, but his current creatinine is 1.6 mg/dL. He is receiving IV fluids and has had a trend of improving creatinine levels.
* Cardiac status: The patient's cardiac arrest is unclear, but it is suspected to be related to hypercarbia and hypoxia. He has a history of chronic hypercarbia and takes multiple narcotic pain medications.
* Shock: The patient's hypotension on arrival to the ICU was likely related to profound acidosis, hypothermia, or an underlying infectious source. He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and is being monitored for further signs of shock.
* CK elevation: The patient's CK elevation is unlikely to be cardiac-related, given the low MB and MBI levels. Troponin is slightly elevated, but this may be due to renal insufficiency and stress from hypotension.
* Diabetes mellitus: The patient's blood sugar levels are in the 300s, and he is being treated with insulin and monitored for blood sugars q1h.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is being managed with antihypertensive medications, and he is being monitored for further signs of hypertension.

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to continue, and he may require further adjustments to his ventilator settings and oxygen therapy.
* Renal insufficiency: The patient's renal insufficiency may worsen if he continues to receive nephrotoxic medications or if his creatinine levels continue to rise.
* Cardiac status: The patient's cardiac status is uncertain, and he may require further evaluation and treatment for cardiac-related complications.
* Shock: The patient's shock may worsen if he continues to have hypotension or if he develops further signs of shock, such as oliguria or acidosis.
* CK elevation: The patient's CK elevation may indicate ongoing muscle damage, and he may require further evaluation and treatment for this complication.
* Diabetes mellitus: The patient's diabetes mellitus may worsen if he continues to have hyperglycemia or if he develops further complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis.

Assessment and plan:

* The patient's respiratory failure will be managed with adjustments to his ventilator settings and oxygen therapy.
* His renal insufficiency will be monitored, and he will receive further evaluation and treatment as necessary.
* His cardiac status will be further evaluated, and he will receive treatment as necessary.
* His shock will be managed with further evaluation and treatment, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and IV fluids.
* His CK elevation will be monitored, and he will receive further evaluation and treatment as necessary.
* His diabetes mellitus will be managed with insulin and blood sugar monitoring, and he will receive further evaluation and treatment as necessary.

The patient's code status is full code, and he will receive ICU care with ongoing monitoring and treatment for his various medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
 currently on PSV wean, will
   keep on vent with plan to diurese today, wean in Am tomorrow with
   extubation on [**12-22**]
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting - obtained
   - send sputum culture
 if available
   - add on urine legionella antigen - negative
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
 improving as of [**12-21**]
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
 obtained
   will eval for baseline renal fxn
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - pressures remain stable off pressors
   - this AM pt had misfiring of pacemaker
 EP will interrogate in AM
   - support respiratory failure as below
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
 no acute changes in levels
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related to
   profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia. Following
   aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on arrival
   to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source (did have
   leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source is
   infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac function
   (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less suspicion
   for cardiac shock.
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   - pressures stable
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 will start Lantus 15 [**Hospital1 7**], will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.  Stabilized started BP medications
   - started Labetalol and Hydral
   - once PO plan is to restart home meds
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 62 yo M with multiple med problems (DM,
   obesity,severe OSA noncompliant, cadaveric AVR x 2, CRF, COPD with TBM
   w/ Y-stent on home O2 (noncompliant) and chronic pain on narcotics)
   admitted [**12-19**] after PEA arrest.  Continues to improve from neuron
   standpoint. Overnight was weaned to PS. A-line changed yesterday. Low
   grade temps--> blood cx sent.  Resumed anti-htn medications.

   Improving from neuro standpoint when sedation lightened. Tolerating
   vent wean well Vol overloaded-- by imaging and frothy secretions
   holding up extubation at this time.  Will diurese with plan for SBT and
   probable extubation in am.  Given Y-stent and difficult airway having
   IP or anesthesia present would be suggested. Remains stable in terms of
   hemodynamics.  F/[**Location 39**] echo read and resume bp meds for htn.  IV
   afterload as unable to take POs given ? esoph stents and difficulty
   placing NGT. Given anticipated extubation tomorrow, will hold on asking
   GI to place NGT endoscopically. Renal fx continues to improve.  Suspect
   a pre-renal component with ? atn in setting of arrest.  Pacer not
   capturing appropriately on monitor
will consult ep for interrogation.
   Remains NPO--would resume 1/2 dose lantus and monitor with cs (also ?
   of getting steroids on ED study). Had low grade temp overnight and with
   leukocytosis.  At risk for VAP/aspiration, UTI.  Lines fresh.
   Clinically has minimal secretions (frothy) with no clear infiltrate on
   imaging. Also ? of steroids from study.  Continue empiric antibx
   (vanco/cef) pending final cx data, with recx sent last night.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 62 yo M with multiple med problems (DM,
   obesity,severe OSA noncompliant, cadaveric AVR x 2, CRF, COPD with TBM
   w/ Y-stent on home O2 (noncompliant) and chronic pain on narcotics)
   admitted [**12-19**] after PEA arrest.  Continues to improve from neuron

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes, atrioventricular valve replacement, tracheobronchomalacia with tracheal stenting, and chronic pain. He was admitted to the ICU after a prolonged cardiac arrest and is currently intubated and sedated. The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia, and recurrent pneumonias, which may contribute to his respiratory failure.
2. Renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine is unknown, but his current creatinine level is elevated, and he is at risk for further renal damage due to his underlying medical conditions and medications.
3. Cardiac arrest: The patient had a prolonged cardiac arrest, which is likely related to his underlying medical conditions, including his history of atrioventricular valve replacement and tracheobronchomalacia.
4. Shock: The patient's hypotension may be related to his underlying medical conditions, including his history of atrioventricular valve replacement and tracheobronchomalacia, as well as his respiratory failure and renal insufficiency.
5. CK elevation: The patient's CK level is elevated, which may be related to his cardiac arrest and underlying medical conditions.
6. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has type 2 diabetes, which is poorly controlled, and he is at risk for further complications due to his underlying medical conditions and medications.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to his underlying medical conditions, including his history of sleep apnea and tracheobronchomalacia.
2. Renal insufficiency: The patient's renal insufficiency may worsen due to his underlying medical conditions, including his history of atrioventricular valve replacement and tracheobronchomalacia, as well as his respiratory failure and medications.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient may be at risk for further cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, and cardiac arrest.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his underlying medical conditions, including his history of atrioventricular valve replacement and tracheobronchomalacia, as well as his respiratory failure and renal insufficiency.
5. Nutritional complications: The patient is at risk for nutritional complications, including malnutrition and dehydration, due to his underlying medical conditions and medications.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's condition is critically ill, and he requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications. The patient's respiratory failure and renal insufficiency require ongoing management, including mechanical ventilation and diuretic therapy. The patient's cardiac arrest and underlying medical conditions require ongoing monitoring and management, including cardiac enzymes and echocardiography. The patient's diabetes mellitus requires ongoing management, including insulin therapy and blood glucose monitoring. The patient's hypertension requires ongoing management, including antihypertensive medications and blood pressure monitoring."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
 currently on PSV wean, will
   keep on vent with plan to diurese today, wean in Am tomorrow with
   extubation on [**12-22**]
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting - obtained
   - send sputum culture
 if available
   - add on urine legionella antigen - negative
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
 improving as of [**12-21**]
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
 obtained
   will eval for baseline renal fxn
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - pressures remain stable off pressors
   - this AM pt had misfiring of pacemaker
 EP will interrogate in AM
   - support respiratory failure as below
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
 no acute changes in levels
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related to
   profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia. Following
   aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on arrival
   to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source (did have
   leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source is
   infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac function
   (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less suspicion
   for cardiac shock.
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   - pressures stable
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 will start Lantus 15 [**Hospital1 7**], will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.  Stabilized started BP medications
   - started Labetalol and Hydral
   - once PO plan is to restart home meds
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
 currently on PSV wean, will
   keep on vent with plan to diurese today, wean in Am tomorrow with
   extubation on [**12-22**]
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting - obtained
   - send sputum culture
 if available
   - add on urine legionella antigen - negative
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
 improving as of [**12-21**]
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
 obtained
   will eval for baseline renal fxn
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - pressures remain stable off pressors
   - this AM pt had misfiring of pacemaker
 EP will interrogate in AM
   - support respiratory failure as below
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
 no acute changes in levels
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related to
   profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia. Following
   aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on arrival
   to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source (did have
   leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source is
   infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac function
   (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less suspicion
   for cardiac shock.
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   - pressures stable
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 will start Lantus 15 [**Hospital1 7**], will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.  Stabilized started BP medications
   - started Labetalol and Hydral
   - once PO plan is to restart home meds
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now
   .
   # ACcess: Right IJ CVL, Right radial arterial line

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, tracheobronchomalacia, and recurrent pneumonias. He presents with respiratory failure, renal insufficiency, cardiac arrest, and shock.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of factors, including sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia, and recurrent pneumonias. His ventilator settings need to be adjusted based on his ABGs, and he will be weaned off the ventilator tomorrow with the goal of extubation on December 22.

The patient's renal insufficiency is unclear, and it is unclear what his baseline creatinine level is. His creatinine level is currently improving with IV fluids and resuscitation. He will need to be monitored for renal function, and his medications will need to be adjusted accordingly.

The patient's cardiac status is unclear, and it is unclear what caused his cardiac arrest. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, and his EKG on admission was not concerning for MI. He will need to be monitored for cardiac enzymes and his pacemaker will need to be interrogated.

The patient's shock is likely due to a combination of factors, including hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction, and sepsis. He will need to be monitored for blood pressure and treated broadly for hospital-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's CK elevation is unlikely due to a cardiac source, and his troponin level is slightly elevated due to renal insufficiency and stress from hypotension. His CK levels will need to be cycled to peak.

The patient's diabetes mellitus is being managed with insulin and monitoring of blood sugars. His hypertension is being managed with antihypertensives, and his hypercholesterolemia will be managed with a statin once his NG tube is in place.

The patient's chronic pain will need to be continually reassessed, and he will need to be monitored for signs of sepsis.

The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and he will need to be monitored for hyperkalemia and hypokalemia. His lactate level will need to be repeated.

The patient's code status is full code, and he has a DNR order. His family has been informed of his condition, and his son and wife are his healthcare proxies.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to inadequate ventilation or increased secretions
* Renal insufficiency due to inadequate fluid management or nephrotoxic medications
* Cardiac arrest due to arrhythmias or cardiac dysfunction
* Sepsis due to hospital-acquired pneumonia or other infections
* Hyperkalemia or hypokalemia due to abnormal electrolyte levels
* Worsening of his chronic pain due to inadequate management
* Development of new complications due to his underlying medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
 currently on PSV wean, will
   keep on vent with plan to diurese y/d, with extubation on [**12-22**]
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting - obtained
   - send sputum culture
 if available
 Coag + SA
 cover with Vanc
   Cefepime until [**Last Name (un) 4361**]
   - add on urine legionella antigen - negative
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
 improving as of [**12-22**]
   - adjust meds for normal renal fxn
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
 obtained
   from [**Hospital3 3928**]
 sensitive renal fxn with baseline ~ 0.9-1.1.
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - off pressors
   - this AM pt had continued misfiring of pacemaker
 EP will re-eval
   - support respiratory failure prn
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
 no acute changes in levels
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 will advance Lantus 15 [**Hospital1 7**], will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.  Stabilized started BP medications
   - started correction to previous note - started Metoprolol and Hydral
   [**12-20**]
   - once PO plan is to restart home meds
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   . # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related
   to profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia.
   Following aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on
   arrival to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source
   (did have leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source
   is infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac
   function (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and tracheobronchomalacia, who presented to the ICU after a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and antibiotics. His respiratory status is concerning, with thick secretions, frothy sputum, and a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) score of 135. His cardiac status is also concerning, with a history of atrial fibrillation and a recent cardiac arrest. His renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. His blood glucose level is 91 mg/dL, and he is receiving insulin and sliding scale insulin. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but his calcium level is slightly elevated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with thick secretions and frothy sputum. He may require further interventions, such as bronchoscopy or tracheostomy, to improve his respiratory function.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest may be related to his underlying cardiac condition, such as atrial fibrillation, or to other factors, such as electrolyte imbalances or hypoxia. He may require further evaluation and management to determine the cause of his cardiac arrest.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL. He may require further evaluation and management to determine the cause of his renal insufficiency and to improve his renal function.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is 91 mg/dL, which is slightly low. He may require further evaluation and management to determine the cause of his hypoglycemia and to improve his blood glucose control.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but his calcium level is slightly elevated. He may require further evaluation and management to determine the cause of his electrolyte imbalances and to improve his electrolyte levels.
6. Infection: The patient's thick secretions and frothy sputum may be indicative of an infection, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. He may require further evaluation and management to determine the cause of his infection and to improve his respiratory function.
7. Bleeding: The patient's blood glucose level is 91 mg/dL, which may increase his risk of bleeding. He may require further evaluation and management to determine the cause of his bleeding and to improve his hemostasis.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and vasopressors as needed to support the patient's respiratory and cardiac function.
2. Administer antibiotics to treat any potential infections.
3. Monitor the patient's blood glucose level and adjust his insulin regimen as needed to maintain tight glycemic control.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust his electrolyte supplements as needed to maintain normal levels.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust his cardiac medications as needed to maintain normal cardiac function.
6. Consider further evaluation and management to determine the cause of the patient's respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and renal insufficiency.
7. Consider further evaluation and management to determine the cause of the patient's bleeding and to improve his hemostasis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to cardiac arrest and respiratory failure. He has a history of hypertension, type II diabetes, and altered mental status. He is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefipime. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 145/64 mmHg. He has a central venous pressure of 18 mmHg and a fluid balance of -2783 mL.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's thick secretions overnight may indicate the development of pneumonia, which can worsen his respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases his risk of developing VAP, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
3. Sepsis: The patient's antibiotics may not be effective against the underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and the use of propofol, a sedative with cardiac effects, may increase his risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Renal failure: The patient's fluid balance and increased creatinine levels may indicate early signs of renal failure, which can worsen his overall condition.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to the development of pneumonia or VAP, which can lead to further respiratory distress and organ dysfunction.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of diabetes and the use of antibiotics may increase his risk of developing hypoglycemia, which can worsen his overall condition.
8. Catheter-related complications: The patient's central venous catheter and arterial line may increase his risk of developing catheter-related complications, such as infection or bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
 currently on PSV wean, will
   keep on vent with plan to diurese y/d, with extubation on [**12-22**]
   - obtain records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting - obtained
   - send sputum culture
 if available
 Coag + SA
 cover with Vanc
   Cefepime until [**Last Name (un) 4361**]
   - add on urine legionella antigen - negative
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
 improving as of [**12-22**]
   - adjust meds for normal renal fxn
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - obtain records from PCP to establish recent Cr baseline
 obtained
   from [**Hospital3 3928**]
 sensitive renal fxn with baseline ~ 0.9-1.1.
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - off pressors
   - this AM pt had continued misfiring of pacemaker
 EP will re-eval
   - support respiratory failure prn
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
 no acute changes in levels
   - continually reassess neurologic status
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 will advance Lantus 15 [**Hospital1 7**], will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.  Stabilized started BP medications
   - started correction to previous note - started Metoprolol and Hydral
   [**12-20**]
   - once PO plan is to restart home meds
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. Not currently on any
   sedation and will wait for mental status to improve prior to giving any
   narcotics or benzos, etc.
   . # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related
   to profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia.
   Following aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on
   arrival to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source
   (did have leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source
   is infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac
   function (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less
   suspicion for cardiac shock. Resolved
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   - pressures stable
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.  Resolved
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now
   .
   # ACcess: Right IJ CVL, Right radial arterial line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and tracheobronchomalacia. He was admitted to the ICU following a prolonged cardiac arrest and is currently being treated for multiple medical conditions.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 285. He is being ventilated with a CPAP/PSV mode and is receiving supplemental oxygen. The patient's blood pressure is labile, with a systolic blood pressure ranging from 115 to 171 mmHg. His heart rate is 80 beats per minute, and his cardiac rhythm is ventricular-paced.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 30 mL/min. He is receiving intravenous fluids and diuretics to manage his fluid status and electrolyte imbalance.

The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, with a recent cardiac arrest and a prolonged QT interval on his electrocardiogram (ECG). He is receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin and warfarin, and his international normalized ratio (INR) is 1.3.

The patient's laboratory results are notable for an elevated white blood cell count, a low hemoglobin level, and an elevated lactate level. His blood glucose level is 154 mg/dL, and he is receiving insulin therapy to manage his hyperglycemia.

Potential medical complications that could arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he is at risk of developing respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is concerning, and he is at risk of developing another cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, and he is at risk of developing acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Sepsis: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, which increases his risk of developing sepsis.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient is receiving insulin therapy, which increases his risk of developing hypoglycemia.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which could lead to arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other complications.

In summary, the patient is a complex medical case with multiple comorbidities, including respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, renal impairment, and hyperglycemia. He is at risk of developing various medical complications, including respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, renal failure, sepsis, hypoglycemia, and electrolyte imbalance. Close monitoring and management of his condition are essential to prevent these complications and ensure his optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,154 mL of fluids in the last 24 hours, with a net loss of 2,536 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving CPAP/PSV ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

Lab results:

* Blood counts: The patient's white blood cell count is 14.4 K/uL, and platelet count is 172 K/uL.
* Electrolytes: The patient's sodium level is 138 mg/dL, potassium level is 4.1 mEq/L, and magnesium level is 2.2 mg/dL.
* Renal function: The patient's creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, indicating potential kidney dysfunction.
* Liver function: The patient's liver enzymes are slightly elevated, with an ALT of 36 IU/L and an AST of 46 IU/L.
* Cardiac biomarkers: The patient's troponin-T level is 0.07 ng/mL, indicating potential cardiac damage.

Assessment and plan:

* The patient is diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, altered mental status, respiratory failure, acute cardiac arrest, and potential cardiac damage.
* The patient requires ongoing ICU care, including respiratory support, vasopressor therapy, and close monitoring of vital signs and lab results.
* The patient's medication regimen will need to be adjusted to address potential complications, such as hypoglycemia, hypotension, and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy and potential insulin resistance
* Hypotension due to vasopressor therapy and potential cardiac dysfunction
* Respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or chronic respiratory disease
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to cardiac damage and potential electrolyte imbalances
* Renal failure due to potential kidney dysfunction and inadequate fluid management
* Sepsis or septic shock due to potential infections and inadequate antibiotic therapy
* Vascular complications, such as DVT or VAP, due to prolonged immobility and invasive lines."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
 currently on PSV wean, on vent
   overnight - > diuresed overnight and this AM
 extubated on [**12-23**]
   - obtained records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   - send sputum culture
 if available
 Coag + SA
 cover with
   Vanc/Cefepime until [**Last Name (un) 4361**]
   - urine legionella antigen - negative
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
 improving as of [**12-23**]
   - adjusted meds for improved renal fxn
   - avoided nephrotoxins
   - obtained recs from [**Hospital3 3928**]
 renal fxn baseline ~ 0.9-1.1.
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - off pressors
   - overnight and this AM pt had continuous firing of pacer
 EP will
   re-eval [**12-23**]
   - support respiratory failure
 now extubated on face tent
   - enzymes cycled
 no issues remain
   - reassess neurologic status now that pt is extubated
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 advanced Lantus to 20 [**Hospital1 7**], will start on home regimen when back to
   eating will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.  Stabilized started BP medications
   - started correction to previous note - started Metoprolol and Hydral
   [**12-20**]
   - once PO plan is to restart home meds
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. D/c
d sedation and will wait
   for mental status to improve prior to giving any narcotics or benzos,
   etc.
   .
   . # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related
   to profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia.
   Following aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on
   arrival to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source
   (did have leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source
   is infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac
   function (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less
   suspicion for cardiac shock. Resolved
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   - pressures stable
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.  Resolved
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now
   .
   # ACcess: Right IJ CVL, Right radial arterial line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, tracheobronchomalacia, and recurrent pneumonias. He presented to the ICU in cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. The patient has multiple comorbidities that may contribute to his current condition, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia, and recurrent pneumonias, which may have contributed to his respiratory failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 285, indicating severe hypoxemia.
2. Renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine is unknown, but his current creatinine level is 1.4 mg/dL, which may indicate acute kidney injury. He is receiving IV fluids and diuretics to improve renal function.
3. Cardiac status: The patient had a cardiac arrest, and his cardiac function is preserved at this time. However, his electrocardiogram (ECG) is not concerning for myocardial infarction (MI). He is currently on pressors and has a cardiac rhythm of ventricular paced.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is 154 mg/dL, which may indicate diabetes mellitus. He is receiving insulin and will be started on a home regimen when he is able to eat.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is 136/62 mmHg, which may indicate hypertension. He is currently on antihypertensive medications and will be restarted on his home regimen when he is stabilized.
6. Chronic pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain and is receiving sedation and pain medications. He will be reassessed for pain management once his mental status improves.
7. Shock: The patient's hypotension on arrival to the ICU may be related to profound acidosis, hypothermia, or an underlying infectious source. He is currently receiving IV fluids and pressors to treat his shock.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient may experience further respiratory failure if his underlying pulmonary issues are not adequately managed.
2. Renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function may continue to decline if his underlying condition is not treated.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient may experience cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure if his cardiac function is not properly managed.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient may experience further hyperglycemia if his diabetes is not properly managed.
5. Hypertension: The patient may experience further hypertension if his blood pressure is not properly managed.
6. Chronic pain: The patient may experience further pain if his chronic pain is not properly managed.
7. Shock: The patient may experience further shock if his underlying condition is not treated.

The patient's laboratory results are significant for elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, and elevated lactate levels, which may indicate an underlying infection. His ECG shows a ventricular paced rhythm, and his troponin level is slightly elevated, which may indicate cardiac stress. His blood glucose level is elevated, and he is receiving insulin therapy. His creatinine level is elevated, and he is receiving IV fluids and diuretics to improve renal function."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
 currently on PSV wean, on vent
   overnight - > diuresed overnight and this AM
 extubated on [**12-23**]
   - obtained records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   - send sputum culture
 if available
 Coag + SA
 cover with
   Vanc/Cefepime until [**Last Name (un) 4361**]
   - urine legionella antigen - negative
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
 improving as of [**12-23**]
   - adjusted meds for improved renal fxn
   - avoided nephrotoxins
   - obtained recs from [**Hospital3 3928**]
 renal fxn baseline ~ 0.9-1.1.
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - off pressors
   - overnight and this AM pt had continuous firing of pacer
 EP will
   re-eval [**12-23**]
   - support respiratory failure
 now extubated on face tent
   - enzymes cycled
 no issues remain
   - reassess neurologic status now that pt is extubated
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 advanced Lantus to 20 [**Hospital1 7**], will start on home regimen when back to
   eating will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.  Stabilized started BP medications
   - started correction to previous note - started Metoprolol and Hydral
   [**12-20**]
   - once PO plan is to restart home meds
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. D/c
d sedation and will wait
   for mental status to improve prior to giving any narcotics or benzos,
   etc.
   .
   . # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related
   to profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia.
   Following aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on
   arrival to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source
   (did have leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source
   is infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac
   function (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less
   suspicion for cardiac shock. Resolved
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   - pressures stable
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.  Resolved
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now
   .
   # ACcess: Right IJ CVL, Right radial arterial line
   .
   # CODE: full, discussed with family
   .
   # COMM: with patient and family. Son [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 4273**] is HCP ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 4276**], Wife [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4277**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
 currently on PSV wean, on vent

   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
 improving as of [**12-23**]
   - adjusted meds for improved renal fxn
   - avoided nephrotoxins
   - obtained recs from [**Hospital3 3928**]
 renal fxn baseline ~ 0.9-1.1.
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).

   though home regimen unclear.  Stabilized started BP medications

   taking POs.

   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. D/c
d sedation and will wait
   for mental status to improve prior to giving any narcotics or benzos,
   etc.
   .
   . # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related
   to profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia.
   Following aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on
   arrival to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source
   (did have leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source
   is infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac
   function (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less
   suspicion for cardiac shock. Resolved
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and tracheobronchomalacia who presented with respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. He was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation, but was extubated on day 2. His current condition is characterized by:

* Respiratory failure: Unclear precipitant, but likely related to sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia, and recurrent pneumonias.
* Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest, but likely related to chronic hypercarbia, multiple narcotic pain medications, and possible cardiac event.
* Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine, but likely related to shock and arrest.
* Hyperglycemia: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU, starting insulin gtt and monitoring blood sugars q1h.
* Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now, but will reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized.

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: Pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory acidosis.
* Cardiac status: Cardiac tamponade, myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrhythmias.
* Renal insufficiency: Acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and electrolyte imbalances.
* Hyperglycemia: Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), and hypoglycemia.
* Hypertension: Hypertensive crisis, hypertensive encephalopathy, and hypertensive heart disease.

Assessment and plan:

* Respiratory support: Adjust ventilator settings per ABGs, and consider non-invasive ventilation (NIV) if possible.
* Cardiac support: Monitor cardiac rhythm and function, and consider antiarrhythmic medications if necessary.
* Renal support: Monitor creatinine and electrolytes, and consider hemodialysis if necessary.
* Hyperglycemia management: Continue insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h, and consider sliding scale insulin if necessary.
* Hypertension management: Monitor blood pressure and adjust medications as necessary.
* Cardiovascular support: Monitor cardiac function and consider anti-ischemic medications if necessary.

Recommendations:

* Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory, cardiac, renal, and metabolic status closely.
* Consider repeating ABGs and chest X-ray to monitor for respiratory deterioration.
* Consider repeating cardiac enzymes and troponin to monitor for cardiac damage.
* Consider repeating creatinine and electrolytes to monitor for renal insufficiency.
* Consider repeating blood sugar levels to monitor for hyperglycemia.
* Consider adjusting medications as necessary to manage hypertension, hyperglycemia, and respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
 currently on PSV wean, on vent
   overnight - > diuresed overnight and this AM
 extubated on [**12-23**]
   - obtained records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   - send sputum culture
 if available
 Coag + SA
 cover with
   Vanc/Cefepime until [**Last Name (un) 4361**]
   - urine legionella antigen - negative
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
 improving as of [**12-23**]
   - adjusted meds for improved renal fxn
   - avoided nephrotoxins
   - obtained recs from [**Hospital3 3928**]
 renal fxn baseline ~ 0.9-1.1.
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - off pressors
   - overnight and this AM pt had continuous firing of pacer
 EP will
   re-eval [**12-23**]
   - support respiratory failure
 now extubated on face tent
   - enzymes cycled
 no issues remain
   - reassess neurologic status now that pt is extubated
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 advanced Lantus to 20 [**Hospital1 7**], will start on home regimen when back to
   eating will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.  Stabilized started BP medications
   - started correction to previous note - started Metoprolol and Hydral
   [**12-20**]
   - once PO plan is to restart home meds
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. D/c
d sedation and will wait
   for mental status to improve prior to giving any narcotics or benzos,
   etc.
   .
   . # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related
   to profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia.
   Following aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on
   arrival to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source
   (did have leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source
   is infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac
   function (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less
   suspicion for cardiac shock. Resolved
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   - pressures stable
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.  Resolved
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting. He presented to the ICU with respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and renal insufficiency.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with persistent hypercarbia and hypoxia despite extubation and initiation of non-invasive ventilation. The sputum culture revealed a mixed flora, including Gram-negative rods, Gram-positive cocci, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, with a history of atrial fibrillation and a recent cardiac arrest. The electrocardiogram (ECG) on admission was not concerning for myocardial infarction.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with an elevated creatinine level and a possible baseline creatinine of 0.9-1.1 mg/dL. The patient is receiving diuretics and has a fluid balance deficit.

The patient's mental status is altered, with a possible contribution from multiple factors, including sedatives, narcotics, and hypercarbia. The patient's pain management is a concern, with a history of chronic pain and a current need for pain medication.

The patient's blood pressure is stable, but the patient is still receiving pressors. The patient's lactate level is elevated, and the patient is at risk for further complications, including sepsis, acute kidney injury, and cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Adjusting ventilator settings based on arterial blood gas (ABG) results
* Covering with vancomycin and cefepime until further cultures are available
* Monitoring creatinine levels and adjusting medications as necessary
* Avoiding nephrotoxins
* Obtaining records from the patient's primary care physician and weekend coverage
* Reassessing the patient's cardiac status and considering further evaluation, including an echocardiogram
* Monitoring the patient's mental status and adjusting sedation and pain medication as necessary
* Continuing to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjusting medications as necessary
* Considering further testing, including a troponin level and a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Renal insufficiency
* Sepsis
* Acute kidney injury
* Cardiac arrest
* Pneumonia
* Tracheobronchitis
* Pulmonary embolism
* Deep vein thrombosis
* Stress ulcer
* VAP

The patient's code status is full code, and the patient's disposition is ICU care."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Resolving. Again unclear precipitant though
   patient has multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent
   tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost
   continuously per wife due to sputum production). He also apparently
   takes multiple narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel,
   valium) which could contribute to altered mental status which would
   exacerbate hypoventilation.
   - extubated on [**12-23**]
   - obtained records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   -Coag + SA
 cover with Vanc, awaiting sensitivities
   - [**12-23**] sputum with multiple back on GS. Concerning given treatment
   with cefepime. However prelim growth of only OP flora, likely just
   colonizer. Therefore have not changed abx. If spikes or clinically
   worsens add meropenem for possible ESBL or pseudomonas. Still coughing
   up large amount green sputum
   - urine legionella antigen - negative
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Resolved. baseline creatinine 0.9 to 1.1 per
   [**Hospital3 3928**]. Likely that creatinine will be higher in setting of
   shock and arrest, already improving with IVF and resuscitation. Now
   returned to [**Location 810**] range
   - trend creatinine
   - avoided nephrotoxins
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit, not concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - off pressors
   - overnight and this AM pt had continuous firing of pacer
   re-evaled [**12-23**] shortened a sensing interval
   - support respiratory failure
 now extubated on face tent
   - enzymes cycled
 no issues remain
   - reassess neurologic status now that pt is extubated
   -repeat echo, EF greater than 55 %, high transaoritc valve pressure
   gradiant. Largely unchanged since echo on presentation
   .
   # mental status: question of anoxic injury after down so long in field.
   Pt improving but remains slow to respond
   -trend MS
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Was on
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 advanced Lantus to 20 [**Hospital1 7**], will start on home regimen when back to
   eating will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension:Held antihypertensives on arrival w given pressor
   requirement. Now stabilized, restarting home reg
   - started Metoprolol and Hydral [**12-20**]
   - Restarted ACE as trial for swallowing Pills. If tolerates convert to
   previous oral BP reg
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when clear patient taking
   POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. D/c
d sedation and will wait
   for mental status to improve prior to giving any narcotics or benzos,
   etc. Not complaining of significant pain.
   ..
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.  Resolved
   -continuing to downtrend

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes, atrial valve replacement, and tracheobronchomalacia, who presented with respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated, but was recently extubated and is currently on a face tent. He has a history of recurrent pneumonias, sleep apnea, and chronic hypercarbia, which may have contributed to his respiratory failure. His cardiac status is unclear, but his pacer is working normally, and his echo shows moderate symmetric LVH with probably normal LV systolic function. He has a CK elevation, which is unlikely to be cardiac in origin, and his troponin is slightly elevated but within the range of renal insufficiency and stress from hypotension.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and he is at risk for further complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is unclear, and he may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac failure.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient has a history of renal insufficiency, and his creatinine level is elevated. He may be at risk for further renal decline and acute kidney injury (AKI).
4. Neurological complications: The patient may have suffered an anoxic injury during his cardiac arrest, and he may be at risk for further neurological complications, such as seizures, cerebral edema, and neurological deficits.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent pneumonias and chronic hypercarbia, which may increase his risk for further infections, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and septic shock.
6. Metabolic complications: The patient has diabetes and is at risk for metabolic complications, such as hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and ketoacidosis.
7. Nutritional complications: The patient may have difficulty eating and may require enteral nutrition, which can lead to complications such as aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition.
8. Medication-related complications: The patient is taking multiple medications, which may interact with each other and increase his risk for adverse effects, such as bleeding, electrolyte imbalances, and medication toxicity.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and provide mechanical ventilation as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and provide cardiac support as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and provide dialysis if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and provide supportive care as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and provide antibiotic therapy as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's metabolic status closely and provide insulin therapy as needed.
7. Provide nutritional support as needed, and monitor the patient's nutritional status closely.
8. Monitor the patient's medication regimen closely and adjust as needed to minimize adverse effects."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical history, including hypertension, type II diabetes, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, and blood pressure of 137/59 mmHg. The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, with a tidal volume of 359 mL, and oxygen delivery device set to face tent with a FiO2 of 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.35, PaO2 of 338, and PaCO2 of 57 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (14.7 K/uL), platelet count (213 K/uL), and troponin-T levels (0.07 ng/mL). The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 1.2 mg/dL, and the patient is receiving dialysis.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, type II diabetes, and cardiac arrest. The patient's medications include coumadin, heparin, pantoprazole, metoprolol, and hydralazine.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, and the risk of respiratory failure is high.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest, and the risk of recurrent cardiac arrest is high.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and troponin-T levels suggest the possibility of sepsis.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and need for dialysis suggest the possibility of renal failure.
5. Infection: The patient's respiratory failure and need for invasive ventilation increase the risk of infection.
6. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is elevated, and the risk of bleeding is high.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.35, which is slightly acidic.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level is 142 mg/dL, which is slightly low.

The patient requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory, cardiac, and metabolic status to prevent these complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Again unclear precipitant though patient has
   multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal
   stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost continuously per
   wife due to sputum production). He also apparently takes multiple
   narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel, valium) which could
   contribute to altered mental status which would exacerbate
   hypoventilation.
   - adjust ventilator settings per ABGs
 currently on PSV wean, on vent
   overnight - > diuresed overnight and this AM
 extubated on [**12-23**]
   - obtained records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   - send sputum culture
 if available
 Coag + SA
 cover with
   Vanc/Cefepime until [**Last Name (un) 4361**]
   - urine legionella antigen - negative
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unclear baseline creatinine. Would be helpful to
   obtain records from PCP or coverage over the weekend. Likely that
   creatinine will be higher in setting of shock and arrest, already
   improving with IVF and resuscitation.
   - trend creatinine
 improving as of [**12-23**]
   - adjusted meds for improved renal fxn
   - avoided nephrotoxins
   - obtained recs from [**Hospital3 3928**]
 renal fxn baseline ~ 0.9-1.1.
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit not necessarily concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - off pressors
   - overnight and this AM pt had continuous firing of pacer
 EP will
   re-eval [**12-23**]
   - support respiratory failure
 now extubated on face tent
   - enzymes cycled
 no issues remain
   - reassess neurologic status now that pt is extubated
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Will start
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 advanced Lantus to 20 [**Hospital1 7**], will start on home regimen when back to
   eating will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension: Hold antihypertensives for now given pressor
   requirement on arrival. Reconsider initiation of meds when stabilized,
   though home regimen unclear.  Stabilized started BP medications
   - started correction to previous note - started Metoprolol and Hydral
   [**12-20**]
   - once PO plan is to restart home meds
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when NG in place or patient
   taking POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. D/c
d sedation and will wait
   for mental status to improve prior to giving any narcotics or benzos,
   etc.
   .
   . # Shock: Patient's hypotension on arrival to [**Hospital1 19**] could be related
   to profound acidosis in setting of resuscitation or hypothermia.
   Following aggressive IVFs in ED, pressors were quickly weaned to off on
   arrival to the ICU. Could also be [**2-8**] to underlying infectious source
   (did have leukocytosis and bandemia on arrival) and most obvious source
   is infiltrates seen on chest CT. UA negative on arrival. Cardiac
   function (per echo performed in the ED) preserved at this time so less
   suspicion for cardiac shock. Resolved
   - continue to monitor blood pressure with arterial line
   - treat broadly for HCAP with cefepime / vancomycin
   - send sputum culture
   - repeat lactate
   - pressures stable
   .
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.  Resolved
   - cycle CKs to peak
   - EKG in AM
   .
   # FEN: npo for now as no NG, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now

   # ACcess: Right IJ CVL, Right radial arterial line

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and tracheobronchomalacia, who presented to the ICU after a cardiac arrest. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including respiratory failure, renal insufficiency, and hypertension, which may increase his risk of developing complications.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of tracheobronchomalacia and recurrent pneumonias, which may increase his risk of developing respiratory failure. Weaning from mechanical ventilation and adjusting ventilator settings to optimize oxygenation and ventilation may be necessary.
2. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and his baseline renal function is unclear. Monitoring of creatinine levels and adjusting medications to improve renal function may be necessary.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest may have been caused by a variety of factors, including electrolyte abnormalities, PE, hypothermia, or a cardiac event. Monitoring of cardiac function and adjusting medications to optimize cardiac output may be necessary.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may be related to his underlying medical conditions or the effects of sedation and pain medications. Monitoring of neurological status and adjusting medications to optimize mental status may be necessary.
5. Infection: The patient's sputum culture is pending, and he has a history of recurrent pneumonias. Monitoring of laboratory results and adjusting antibiotics to cover potential infections may be necessary.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, and he has a history of diabetes. Monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjusting medications to optimize glycemic control may be necessary.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and he has a history of hypertension. Monitoring of blood pressure and adjusting medications to optimize blood pressure control may be necessary.
8. Cholelithiasis: The patient's history of hypercholesterolemia and cholelithiasis may increase his risk of developing gallstones.
9. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and immobility may increase his risk of developing VTE. Prophylactic measures, such as compression stockings and anticoagulation, may be necessary.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his multiple comorbidities to prevent complications and optimize his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a history of cardiac arrest, hypertension, type II diabetes, and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, and blood pressure of 165/78 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 94%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is ventricular paced, and their peripheral vascular examination is not assessed. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated lactate dehydrogenase and troponin-T. The patient's kidney function is normal, and their liver function is slightly elevated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, which may lead to cardiac complications such as cardiac failure, arrhythmias, or aortic dissection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still receiving mechanical ventilation, which may lead to respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, or respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's history of cardiac arrest increases the risk of future cardiac arrests, cardiac failure, or arrhythmias.
4. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's type II diabetes may lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemia, or hypoglycemia.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or other underlying medical conditions, which may lead to further complications such as falls, aspiration, or respiratory failure.
6. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and laboratory results may indicate an underlying infection, which may lead to sepsis, septic shock, or organ failure.
7. Bleeding: The patient's elevated platelet count and laboratory results may indicate a bleeding risk, which may lead to hemorrhagic complications such as bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, or other organs.
8. Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine and laboratory results may indicate kidney injury, which may lead to acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or end-stage renal disease."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Resolving. Again unclear precipitant though
   patient has multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent
   tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost
   continuously per wife due to sputum production). He also apparently
   takes multiple narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel,
   valium) which could contribute to altered mental status which would
   exacerbate hypoventilation.
   - extubated on [**12-23**]
   - obtained records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   -Coag + SA
 cover with Vanc, awaiting sensitivities
   - [**12-23**] sputum with multiple back on GS. Concerning given treatment
   with cefepime. However prelim growth of only OP flora, likely just
   colonizer. Therefore have not changed abx. If spikes or clinically
   worsens add meropenem for possible ESBL or pseudomonas. Still coughing
   up large amount green sputum
   - urine legionella antigen - negative
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Resolved. baseline creatinine 0.9 to 1.1 per
   [**Hospital3 3928**]. Likely that creatinine will be higher in setting of
   shock and arrest, already improving with IVF and resuscitation. Now
   returned to [**Location 810**] range
   - trend creatinine
   - avoided nephrotoxins
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit, not concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - off pressors
   - overnight and this AM pt had continuous firing of pacer
   re-evaled [**12-23**] shortened a sensing interval
   - support respiratory failure
 now extubated on face tent
   - enzymes cycled
 no issues remain
   - reassess neurologic status now that pt is extubated
   -repeat echo, EF greater than 55 %, high transaoritc valve pressure
   gradiant. Largely unchanged since echo on presentation
   .
   # mental status: question of anoxic injury after down so long in field.
   Pt improving but remains slow to respond
   -trend MS
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Was on
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 advanced Lantus to 20 [**Hospital1 7**], will start on home regimen when back to
   eating will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension:Held antihypertensives on arrival w given pressor
   requirement. Now stabilized, restarting home reg
   - started Metoprolol and Hydral [**12-20**]
   - Restarted ACE as trial for swallowing Pills. If tolerates convert to
   previous oral BP reg
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when clear patient taking
   POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. D/c
d sedation and will wait
   for mental status to improve prior to giving any narcotics or benzos,
   etc. Not complaining of significant pain.
   ..
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.  Resolved
   -continuing to downtrend
   .
   # FEN: attempting pills with applesauce, advance diet if tolearating
   pills well, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: ppi, bowel meds, pneumoboots for now

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications:

**Medical History:**

* Type 2 diabetes mellitus
* Aortic valve replacement (AVR) twice
* Tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting
* Recurrent pneumonias
* Sleep apnea (likely obesity hypoventilation syndrome)
* Chronic hypercarbia
* Narcotic pain medications

**Current Status:**

* Respiratory failure: Resolving, but still producing large amounts of green sputum
* Renal insufficiency: Resolved, with creatinine levels returning to normal
* Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest, but EKG on admission was not concerning for MI
* Mental status: Questionable anoxic injury, with patient improving but remaining slow to respond
* Hypertension: Stabilized, with restart of home regimen
* Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiation of statin when patient is cleared to take POs
* Chronic pain: Continually reassessing, with plan to wait for mental status to improve before giving narcotics or benzodiazepines
* CK elevation: Resolved, with troponin levels slightly elevated but likely due to renal insufficiency and stress from hypotension

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Respiratory failure: Continued production of green sputum could lead to further respiratory decline
* Cardiac complications: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest, but patient may have suffered anoxic injury or cardiac event
* Renal insufficiency: Patient may experience further decline in renal function if not properly managed
* Hypertension: Patient may experience further hypertension episodes if not properly managed
* Hypercholesterolemia: Patient may experience further hypercholesterolemia episodes if not properly managed
* Chronic pain: Patient may experience further chronic pain episodes if not properly managed
* Infection: Patient is at risk for further infections due to his tracheal stenting and recurrent pneumonias
* Neurological deficits: Patient may experience further neurological deficits due to the anoxic injury or cardiac event

**Plan:**

* Continue to monitor patient's respiratory status and adjust treatment as necessary
* Continue to monitor patient's cardiac status and adjust treatment as necessary

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Resolving. Again unclear precipitant though
   patient has multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent
   tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost
   continuously per wife due to sputum production). He also apparently
   takes multiple narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel,
   valium) which could contribute to altered mental status which would
   exacerbate hypoventilation.
   - extubated on [**12-23**]
   - obtained records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   -Coag + SA
 cover with Vanc, awaiting sensitivities
   - [**12-23**] sputum with multiple back on GS. Concerning given treatment
   with cefepime. However prelim growth of only OP flora, likely just
   colonizer. Therefore have not changed abx. If spikes or clinically
   worsens add meropenem for possible ESBL or pseudomonas. Still coughing
   up large amount green sputum
   - urine legionella antigen - negative
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Resolved. baseline creatinine 0.9 to 1.1 per
   [**Hospital3 3928**]. Likely that creatinine will be higher in setting of
   shock and arrest, already improving with IVF and resuscitation. Now
   returned to [**Location 810**] range
   - trend creatinine
   - avoided nephrotoxins
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit, not concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - off pressors
   - overnight and this AM pt had continuous firing of pacer
   re-evaled [**12-23**] shortened a sensing interval
   - support respiratory failure
 now extubated on face tent
   - enzymes cycled
 no issues remain
   - reassess neurologic status now that pt is extubated
   -repeat echo, EF greater than 55 %, high transaoritc valve pressure
   gradiant. Largely unchanged since echo on presentation
   .
   # mental status: question of anoxic injury after down so long in field.
   Pt improving but remains slow to respond
   -trend MS
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Was on
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 advanced Lantus to 20 [**Hospital1 7**], will start on home regimen when back to
   eating will follow FSBGs

   # Hypertension:Held antihypertensives on arrival w given pressor
   requirement. Now stabilized, restarting home reg
   - started Metoprolol and Hydral [**12-20**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost
   continuously per wife due to sputum production). He also apparently
   takes multiple narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel,
   valium) which could contribute to altered mental status which would

   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia, and recurrent pneumonias, which increases the risk of respiratory failure. The patient is currently extubated, but there is a concern about his ability to maintain adequate ventilation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of atrioventricular valve replacement and may be at risk for cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure. The echocardiogram shows moderate symmetric LVH with probably normal LV systolic function, but the aortic valve prosthesis has a higher than expected velocity, which may indicate stenosis or regurgitation.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and may be at risk for worsening renal function, particularly with the use of nephrotoxic medications.
4. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of altered mental status, which may be related to hypoxia, hypercarbia, or anoxic injury. The patient is currently improving but remains slow to respond, and there is a concern about potential neurologic deficits.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent pneumonias and is currently receiving antibiotics for a suspected infection. There is a risk of developing antibiotic-resistant infections or sepsis.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of chronic pain and is currently receiving opioids, which may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as constipation, nausea, and vomiting.
7. Hematological complications: The patient has a history of anemia and may be at risk for worsening anemia, particularly with the use of nephrotoxic medications.
8. Endocrine complications: The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and may be at risk for worsening hyperglycemia, particularly with the use of steroids or other medications that can affect glucose control.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Resolved. Again unclear precipitant though
   patient has multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent
   tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost
   continuously per wife due to sputum production). He also apparently
   takes multiple narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel,
   valium) which could contribute to altered mental status which would
   exacerbate hypoventilation.
   - extubated on [**12-23**], sating well on 4L
   - obtained records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   -Coag + SA
 cover with Vanc, awaiting sensitivities
   - [**12-23**] sputum with multiple bacteria on GS. Concerning given treatment
   with cefepime. However prelim growth of only OP flora, likely just
   colonizer. Therefore have not changed abx. If spikes or clinically
   worsens add meropenem for possible ESBL or pseudomonas. Sputum
   decreasing
   - urine legionella antigen
 negative
   -continue to diurese to improve resp status. Goal negative 1.5 L daily
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Resolved. baseline creatinine 0.9 to 1.1 per
   [**Hospital3 3928**]. Likely that creatinine will be higher in setting of
   shock and arrest, already improving with IVF and resuscitation. Now
   returned to [**Location 810**] range
   - trend creatinine
   - avoided nephrotoxins
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit, not concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - off pressors
   - overnight and this AM pt had continuous firing of pacer
   re-evaled [**12-23**] shortened a sensing interval
   - support respiratory failure
 now extubated on face tent
   - enzymes cycled
 no issues remain
   - reassess neurologic status now that pt is extubated
   -repeat echo, EF greater than 55 %, high transaoritc valve pressure
   gradiant. Largely unchanged since echo on presentation
   .
   # mental status: question of anoxic injury after down so long in field.
   Pt improving but remains slow to respond
   -trend MS
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Was on
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 advanced Lantus to 20 [**Hospital1 7**], will start on home regimen when back to
   eating will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension:Held antihypertensives on arrival w given pressor
   requirement. Now stabilized, restarting home reg
   - started Metoprolol and Hydral [**12-20**]
   - Restarted ACE as trial for swallowing Pills. If tolerates convert to
   previous oral BP reg
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Reinitiate statin when clear patient taking
   POs.
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. D/c
d sedation and will wait
   for mental status to improve prior to giving any narcotics or benzos,
   etc. Not complaining of significant pain.
   ..
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.  Resolved

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes, atrioventricular valve replacement (AVR) twice, and tracheobronchomalacia with recent tracheal stenting. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which is unclear in its precipitant. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, tracheobronchomalacia, and recurrent pneumonias.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.6°C (97.8°F)
* Heart rate: 72 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 165/78 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 inspirations per minute (ins/min)
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Cardiac rhythm: Ventricular-paced

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.0 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 233 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 28 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: normal
* Liver enzymes: normal
* Lipid profile: normal

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: resolved
* Renal insufficiency: resolved
* Cardiac status: unclear, with a possible cardiac event or anoxic injury
* Mental status: altered, with a possible anoxic injury
* Diabetes mellitus: type 2, with hyperglycemia
* Hypertension: controlled
* Hypercholesterolemia: managed with a statin
* Chronic pain: managed with analgesics

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Antibiotics for pneumonia and suspected Legionella infection
* Diuretics to improve respiratory status
* Pressors to manage blood pressure
* Cardiac support with pacing
* Nutrition and glycemic control
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to pneumonia or tracheobronchomalacia
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to underlying cardiac disease or anoxic injury
* Renal insufficiency or acute kidney injury due to hypotension or medication
* Diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome due to uncontrolled blood sugars
* Hypertensive crisis or hypotensive episode due to uncontrolled blood pressure
* Infection or sepsis due to pneumonia or other underlying conditions
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to stress ulcer or medication
* Venous thromboembolism (VTE) or pulmonary embolism due to immobility or other factors

Based on the patient's current status and medical conditions, it is essential to continue monitoring his vital signs, laboratory results, and treatment response closely to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Resolved. Again unclear precipitant though
   patient has multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent
   tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost
   continuously per wife due to sputum production). He also apparently
   takes multiple narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel,
   valium) which could contribute to altered mental status which would
   exacerbate hypoventilation.

   -continue to diurese to improve resp status. Goal negative 1.5 L daily

   # Renal insufficiency: Resolved. baseline creatinine 0.9 to 1.1 per

   shock and arrest, already improving with IVF and resuscitation. Now
   returned to [**Location 810**] range
   - trend creatinine
   - avoided nephrotoxins
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit, not concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a complex medical history, including type 2 diabetes, aortic valve replacement, and tracheobronchomalacia. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest and was found to have multiple medical issues, including respiratory failure, renal insufficiency, and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is on 4L oxygen and has a SpO2 of 94%. He has a history of sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia, and recurrent pneumonias, which may contribute to his respiratory failure.
* Cardiac status: The patient has a history of aortic valve replacement and was found to have a higher-than-expected velocity in the aortic valve prosthesis during the transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE). His ejection fraction (EF) is greater than 55%.
* Renal status: The patient's creatinine levels have improved, and he is no longer in renal insufficiency.
* Neurological status: The patient's mental status is improving, but he remains slow to respond. He has a history of anoxic injury and may have neurologic deficits following his cardiac arrest.
* Infectious status: The patient has a history of recurrent pneumonias and has been treated with antibiotics. His sputum culture is pending, and he has a growth of multiple bacteria, including OP flora.
* Endocrine status: The patient has type 2 diabetes and was treated with insulin and oral medications.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's history of sleep apnea, tracheobronchomalacia, and recurrent pneumonias may contribute to his respiratory failure. He may require continued oxygen therapy and diuresis to improve his respiratory status.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's history of aortic valve replacement and the finding of a higher-than-expected velocity in the aortic valve prosthesis during the TTE may indicate cardiac complications. He may require continued monitoring of his cardiac status and treatment with anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents.
* Neurological complications: The patient's history of anoxic injury and potential neurologic deficits following his cardiac arrest may lead to neurological complications. He may require continued monitoring of his neurological status and treatment with anticonvulsants and pain medications.
* Infectious complications: The patient's history of recurrent pneumonias and the growth of multiple bacteria in his sputum may indicate infectious complications. He may require continued treatment with antibiotics and monitoring of his sputum culture results.
* Endocrine complications: The patient's type 2 diabetes may lead to endocrine complications, such as hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. He may require continued monitoring of his blood glucose levels and treatment with insulin and oral medications.

Overall, the patient's complex medical history and current condition require continued close monitoring and treatment to prevent potential medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Resolved. Again unclear precipitant though
   patient has multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent
   tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost
   continuously per wife due to sputum production). He also apparently
   takes multiple narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel,
   valium) which could contribute to altered mental status which would
   exacerbate hypoventilation.
   - extubated on [**12-23**], sating well on 4L
   - obtained records from [**Location (un) 755**] regarding tracheal stenting
   -Coag + SA
 cover with Vanc, awaiting sensitivities
   - [**12-23**] sputum with multiple bacteria on GS. Concerning given treatment
   with cefepime. However prelim growth of only OP flora, likely just
   colonizer. Therefore have not changed abx. If spikes or clinically
   worsens add meropenem for possible ESBL or pseudomonas. Sputum
   decreasing
   - urine legionella antigen
 negative
   -continue to diurese to improve resp status. Goal negative 1.5 L daily
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Resolved. baseline creatinine 0.9 to 1.1 per
   [**Hospital3 3928**]. Likely that creatinine will be higher in setting of
   shock and arrest, already improving with IVF and resuscitation. Now
   returned to [**Location 810**] range
   - trend creatinine
   - avoided nephrotoxins
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit, not concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).
   - off pressors
   - had continuous firing of pacer
 EP re-evaled [**12-23**] shortened a
   sensing interval
   -repeat echo, EF greater than 55 %, high transaoritc valve pressure
   gradiant. Largely unchanged since echo on presentation
   - brief period of A flutter on tele resolved spontaneously.
   .
   # mental status: question of anoxic injury after down so long in field.
   Pt improving but remains slow to respond
   -trend MS, today seems more oriented responding quicker, seems improved
   .
   # Diabetes mellitus: FSBS in 300s on arrival to the ICU. Was on
   insulin gtt and monitor blood sugars q1h until under better control.
 advanced Lantus to 20 [**Hospital1 7**], will start on home regimen when back to
   eating will follow FSBGs
   .
   # Hypertension:Held antihypertensives on arrival w given pressor
   requirement. Now stabilized, restarting home reg
   - Metoprolol, ACE back at home dose. d/ced Hydral
   -continue lasix diuresis 40 IV this am
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia: Restarted statin
   .
   # Chronic pain: Will continually reassess. D/c
d sedation and will wait
   for mental status to improve prior to giving any narcotics or benzos,
   etc. Not complaining of significant pain.
   ..
   # CK elevation: Unlikely cardiac source given low MB and MBI. Troponin
   slightly elevated but in setting of renal insufficiency and stress from
   hypotension.  Resolved

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 66 y/o man with PMH notable for type 2 DM, AVR X 2, and TBM
   s/p tracheal stent who presents status post PEA arrest.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Resolved. Again unclear precipitant though
   patient has multiple pulmonary issues including sleep apnea (likely
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome), tracheobronchomalacia with recent
   tracheal stenting, and recurrent pneumonias (antibiotics almost
   continuously per wife due to sputum production). He also apparently
   takes multiple narcotics and other meds (i.e., flexeril, seroquel,
   valium) which could contribute to altered mental status which would
   exacerbate hypoventilation.

   # Renal insufficiency: Resolved. baseline creatinine 0.9 to 1.1 per
   [**Hospital3 3928**]. Likely that creatinine will be higher in setting of
   shock and arrest, already improving with IVF and resuscitation. Now
   returned to [**Location 810**] range
   - trend creatinine
   - avoided nephrotoxins
   .
   # Cardiac status: Unclear circumstances surrounding the arrest. From
   family history, patient will fall asleep frequently during the day.
   This could be secondary to chronic hypercarbia which could be
   exacerbated by patient's multiple narcotic pain medications. Could
   hypothesize that patient took additional narcotics which depressed his
   already-tenuous respiratory drive leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia
   which led to PEA arrest. Other possibility is cardiac event but ekg on
   admit, not concerning for MI. Other etiologies (electrolyte
   abnormalities, PE, hypothermia) less likely given lab and scan results.
   Unclear what type of neurologic deficits, if any, he will have
   following this event. We elected not to cool him per protocol with
   arctic sun due to length of time since arrest (~ 1315 and 1815 on
   arrival to MICU) in addition to instability of blood pressures (on 3
   pressors on arrival to MICU).

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes, aortic valve replacement, and tracheobronchomalacia, who presented to the ICU after a cardiac arrest. He was intubated and treated for respiratory failure, and his condition has been improving. His mental status is also improving, but he remains slow to respond. His cardiac status is uncertain, and an echo revealed moderate symmetric LVH with probably normal LV systolic function. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics. His renal function has improved, and he is no longer requiring pressors. He is at risk for developing hypotension, hypoxia, and hypercarbia due to his chronic hypercarbia and multiple narcotic pain medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for developing respiratory failure again due to his chronic hypercarbia, multiple narcotic pain medications, and tracheobronchomalacia.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is uncertain, and he may be at risk for developing cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or heart failure.
3. Renal insufficiency: The patient's renal function has improved, but he may still be at risk for developing renal insufficiency due to his chronic kidney disease and potential nephrotoxic medications.
4. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is at risk for developing secondary infections due to his compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
5. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension and may be at risk for developing hypertensive emergencies such as hypertensive encephalopathy or hypertensive heart disease.
6. Hypercarbia: The patient's chronic hypercarbia may lead to respiratory failure, cardiac complications, and other systemic complications.
7. Narcotic overdose: The patient's multiple narcotic pain medications may lead to narcotic overdose, respiratory depression, and other systemic complications.
8. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's prolonged cardiac arrest may have led to anoxic brain injury, which could result in long-term cognitive and neurological deficits.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust his medications as necessary to prevent cardiac complications.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his medications as necessary to prevent renal insufficiency.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's infection status and adjust his antibiotics as necessary to prevent secondary infections.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust his medications as necessary to prevent hypertensive emergencies.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's hypercarbia and adjust his ventilator settings as necessary to prevent respiratory failure.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's narcotic use and adjust his medications as necessary to prevent narcotic overdose.
8. Consider performing a brain imaging study to evaluate for anoxic brain injury."
