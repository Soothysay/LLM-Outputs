   Assessment and Plan
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to hypovolemia (reduced intake, possible
   blood loss) and sepsis.  Improved.  monitor BP, maintain MAP >60.
   SEPSIS -- low grade temp.  Concern for line related infection
 now
   with GPC from blood culture obtained at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital.  Empirical
   Daptomycin, Levofloxicin.  Await culture results.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to change
   line, esp. if cultures remain positive.
   ANEMIA -- decrease in setting of recent renal bx, iv fluid
   resussitation.  Monitor serial Hct.
   RENAL INSUFFICIENCY -- prerenal failure in background of renal
   insufficiency.  Monitor UO, BUN, creatinine.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia --> improved.  Continue repletion to maintain BP,
   P and urine output.
   PULMONARY HYPERTENSION -- stable dose of flolan.  continue.
   HIT + -- avoid heparin products.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is:

1. Hypotension: attributed to hypovolemia (reduced intake, possible blood loss) and sepsis.
2. Sepsis: low-grade temperature, concern for line-related infection, and empirical treatment with Daptomycin and Levofloxicin.
3. Anemia: decreased in setting of recent renal biopsy and IV fluid resuscitation, with serial Hct monitoring.
4. Renal Insufficiency: prerenal failure in the background of renal insufficiency, with UO, BUN, and creatinine monitoring.
5. Fluids: hypovolemia improved, with continued repletion to maintain BP, P, and urine output.
6. Pulmonary Hypertension: stable dose of flolan, continued.
7. HIT+: avoidance of heparin products.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic shock: if the patient's sepsis worsens, it can lead to septic shock, which can be life-threatening.
2. Renal failure: if the patient's renal insufficiency worsens, it can lead to acute renal failure, which may require dialysis.
3. Pulmonary edema: if the patient's pulmonary hypertension worsens, it can lead to pulmonary edema, which can be life-threatening.
4. Bleeding: if the patient has HIT+, it can increase the risk of bleeding, especially with invasive procedures or anticoagulant therapy.
5. Line-related infections: if the patient's indwelling port or central lines become infected, it can lead to sepsis, bacteremia, or endocarditis.
6. Anemia-related complications: if the patient's anemia worsens, it can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased cardiac output.
7. Hypovolemia-related complications: if the patient's hypovolemia worsens, it can lead to decreased cardiac output, decreased blood pressure, or organ dysfunction.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical condition to address these potential complications and adjust treatment accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Extremities: Warm and without cyanosis or clubbing

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 2.4 K/uL
* Platelet count: 121 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 20 mEq/L
* Serum albumin: 2.2 g/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Calcium: 6.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.6 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.5 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

* Hypotension: attributed to hypovolemia and sepsis, with a plan to monitor blood pressure and maintain mean arterial pressure >60 mmHg
* Sepsis: low-grade temperature, with concern for line-related infection, and a plan to await culture results and continue empirical antibiotics
* Anemia: attributed to recent renal biopsy and iv fluid resuscitation, with a plan to monitor serial hemoglobin levels
* Renal insufficiency: prerenal failure in the background of pre-existing renal insufficiency, with a plan to monitor urine output, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels
* Fluids: hypovolemia improved, with a plan to continue repletion to maintain blood pressure and urine output
* Pulmonary hypertension: stable dose of flolan, with a plan to continue
* HIT+: avoid heparin

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Further deterioration in blood pressure and cardiac output
* Progression of sepsis and development of organ dysfunction
* Continued anemia and potential bleeding complications
* Renal insufficiency and potential need for dialysis
* Pulmonary hypertension and potential complications such as right ventricular failure
* Line-related infections and potential need for surgical intervention
* Hypocalcemia and potential complications such as muscle cramps and seizures
* Hypomagnesemia and potential complications such as muscle weakness and cardiac arrhythmias
* Hyperphosphatemia and potential complications such as soft tissue calcification and nephrocalcinosis"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of fever, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, pulmonary hypertension, and line infections. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and has a central line, arterial line, and urinary catheter in place.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 128/80 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase, indicating an inflammatory response. The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating acute renal failure.

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Line infection: The patient's history of line infections and the presence of a central line and arterial line increase the risk of line infection.
3. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's history of pulmonary hypertension increases the risk of pulmonary complications, such as pulmonary edema or respiratory failure.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output suggest the possibility of acute kidney injury.
5. SLE flare: The patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus increases the risk of SLE flare, which can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, rash, and joint pain.
6. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension increases the risk of organ dysfunction and failure, particularly in the kidneys and liver.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and history of pulmonary hypertension increase the risk of respiratory failure.
8. VAP: The patient's presence of a central line and urinary catheter increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely for signs of sepsis or organ dysfunction.
2. Administer antibiotics as necessary to treat potential infections.
3. Consider adding diuretics to treat acute kidney injury.
4. Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory status closely to prevent respiratory failure.
5. Consider adding medications to treat SLE flare, such as corticosteroids.
6. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely to prevent hypotension and organ dysfunction.
7. Consider adding prophylactic antibiotics to prevent line infections.
8. Monitor the patient's central line and arterial line for signs of infection or malfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with lupus and pulmonary hypertension who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension refractory to IV fluid resuscitation. She has a history of kidney biopsy and recent discharge from the hospital. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics for line sepsis, and her condition is stable. She has a central line, and her blood cultures are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Line sepsis: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she is receiving antibiotics for line sepsis. If the cultures are positive, she may require further treatment and potentially a change in antibiotics.
2. Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and she may have bacteremia, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to right ventricular failure and decreased cardiac output if not managed properly.
4. Leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell count is low, which can increase the risk of infection and make it difficult to treat infections effectively.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which can lead to organ failure and decreased cardiac output if not managed properly.
6. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of kidney biopsy and may be at risk for renal failure if her condition is not managed properly.
7. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure and decreased oxygenation if not treated promptly and effectively.
8. Fungal Infections: The patient is receiving antifungal medication for presumed fungal pneumonia, which can lead to fungal infections if not managed properly.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 51-year-old female with lupus and pulmonary hypertension who was recently discharged from the hospital after a right cardiac catheterization and is now presenting with hypotension refractory to IV fluid resuscitation. She has a history of kidney biopsy and is currently on Flolan and Lasix. The patient is also experiencing a reoccurrence of her typical anterior chest rash, which occurs while on Epoprostel. She is currently on Daptomycin, Levaquin, and other medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Line sepsis: The patient's hypotension and refractory response to IV fluid resuscitation may be secondary to line sepsis, which is supported by the presence of bacteremia and sepsis indicators.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's pulmonary hypertension may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as right heart failure and pulmonary edema.
3. Lupus nephritis: The patient's recent worsening of proteinuria may indicate a worsening of lupus nephritis, which can lead to end-stage renal disease if not properly managed.
4. Infection: The patient's history of recent hospitalization and catheterization increases her risk of developing an infection, particularly line-related infections.
5. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants such as Coumadin and her history of bleeding complications increases her risk of bleeding complications.
6. Thrombosis: The patient's history of pulmonary hypertension and her use of anticoagulants increase her risk of developing thrombosis, particularly pulmonary embolism.
7. Migraines: The patient's history of migraines and her use of amitriptyline may increase her risk of developing migraine-related complications.
8. Depression and anxiety: The patient's history of depression and anxiety and her use of antidepressants may increase her risk of developing depression and anxiety-related complications.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal symptoms and her use of antibiotics may increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as Clostridioides difficile colitis.
10. Renal complications: The patient's history of kidney biopsy and her current use of nephrotoxic medications may increase her risk of developing renal complications, such as acute kidney injury."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical history, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pulmonary hypertension, and a history of line infections.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* Hypothermia, with a temperature range of 36.6-36.7°C (97.8-98°F)
* Tachycardia, with a heart rate of 86 beats per minute (bpm)
* Hypertension, with a blood pressure of 128/80 mmHg
* Tachypnea, with a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula
* Sinus rhythm
* Normal hemodynamic monitoring

The patient has received various medications, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and anticoagulants. They have also received blood products and fluids, with a total fluid balance of -1,845 mL over the past 24 hours.

Laboratory results show:

* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and neutrophil count
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatinine levels
* Elevated troponin-T levels
* Elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST)
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels
* Low albumin and calcium levels
* Elevated potassium and magnesium levels

Potential medical complications that may arise based on the patient's current condition and medical history include:

* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's history of line infections and elevated WBC count
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's pulmonary hypertension and tachypnea
* Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure due to the patient's history of pulmonary hypertension and elevated troponin-T levels
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury due to the patient's history of acute renal failure and elevated creatinine levels
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the patient's history of stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism due to the patient's history of pulmonary hypertension and anticoagulant therapy

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications and ensure optimal care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 51 yo female with lupus and pulm HTN now s/p kidney biopsy and
   recent discharge for right cardiac cath who is presenting with
   hypotension refractory to IVF resuscitation at OSH.
   .
   # Hypotension: Hypotension concerning for SIRS/sepsis or bleed given
   recent procedure, renal biopsy. Other possible etiologies include
   adrenal insufficiency given chronic steroid use and recent procedure,
   medication effect since recently started on Lisinopril, or medication
   effect from Flolan, possible dysfunction although no recent change in
   dose or reported problems. [**Name (NI) 1816**] likely SIRS/sepsis given fever, low
   WBC. Most likely etiology is line infection given tunneled Hickmans x 1
   year, h/o similar episodes in past and c/o tenderness. In past, pt has
   grown Micrococcus from line and blood cx. Due to interactions with
   Linezolid and Amitriptyline (which pt refuses to stop taking) she has
   been treated with Dapto in past as well as levoflox for gram neg
   coverage. Also consider pneumonia, UTI, although no other localizing
   symptoms. Cardiogenic shock less likely cause of hypotension given lack
   of cardiac symptoms and other signs of infection including fever. Here,
   BP has been responsive to IVF with current SBPs high 90s to 100s.
   - IVF NS at 150cc/hour. Has received 4 liters NS at OSH. Appears
   slightly dry on exam with dry mucus menbranes but pulmonary exam with
   crackles, concern for fluid overload. WIll follow mental status, UOP to
   assess need for IVF resuscitation and continue continuous IVF
   - Daptomycin and Levofloxacin for now for empiric coverage
   - Serial lactate to assess hypoperfusion
   - repeat HCT to assess possible bleed, transfuse PRBC to maintain
   HCT>21 or signs active bleed, check coags
   - Will need to assess need to change line given possible line infection
   - UA, urine cx
   - Follow up blood cx from OSH and repeat blood cx x 2 here
   - Consult ID in am given multiple allergies h/o Micrococcus bacteremia,
   ? appropriate ABx use and duration
   - Renal Ultrasound to assess for hematoma/abscess/fluid collection
   after procedure
   - CEs to ROMI. ECG without acute changes
   - Hold Lisinoprol, home Lasix for now
   - If BP remains low will consider stress dose steroids
   .
   #Fever: Most likely [**2-21**] infection as above but also could have
   inflammatory component given worsening lupus recently, low grade fevers
   x 6months.
   - Fever workup and treat infection as above
   .
   #Pulmonary hypertension: Recent cardiac cath demonstrated severe pulm
   HTN despite Flolan.
   - Continue Flolan
   - Will readd Lasix as BP tolerates, holding for now
   - Off Coumadin until Saturday, will assess for bleed, HCT drop
   - Continue supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 sats >93%
   - Consider addition second [**Doctor Last Name **] as per primary pulmonologist but hold
   for now  given hypotension
   .
   # Lupus nephritis: Patient has lupus nephritis with recent worsening of
   proteinuria, most recently Protein/creatinine ratio 8, improved from
   15-16 [**9-27**].
   - Follow renal function (no labs in system yet today)
   .
   # DM: holding oral hypoglycemics, on ISS
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety: Pt on multiple meds at home. Concern for
   serotonin syndrome given multiple medications and received Linezolid.
   Was going to continue Linezolid but contraindicated with Amitriptyline
   and pt refuses to stop amitriptyline. Per pharmacy, should not
   administer both medications. Linezolid changed to Dapto as per prior
   admission.
   - Continued Cymbalta, amitriptyline, holding Wellbutrin
   .
   #Migraines: Continuing Amitrityline
   .
   # FEN: NPO for renal US
   .
   # PPX: Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis (Questionable h/o HIT) ?why pt
   is on fluconazole will continue for now for presumed fungal PPX, bowel
   regimen

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 51 yo female with lupus and pulm HTN now s/p kidney biopsy and
   recent discharge for right cardiac cath who is presenting with
   hypotension refractory to IVF resuscitation at OSH.
   .
   # Hypotension: Hypotension concerning for SIRS/sepsis or bleed given
   recent procedure, renal biopsy. Other possible etiologies include
   adrenal insufficiency given chronic steroid use and recent procedure,
   medication effect since recently started on Lisinopril, or medication
   effect from Flolan, possible dysfunction although no recent change in
   dose or reported problems. [**Name (NI) 1816**] likely SIRS/sepsis given fever, low
   WBC. Most likely etiology is line infection given tunneled Hickmans x 1
   year, h/o similar episodes in past and c/o tenderness. In past, pt has
   grown Micrococcus from line and blood cx. Due to interactions with
   Linezolid and Amitriptyline (which pt refuses to stop taking) she has
   been treated with Dapto in past as well as levoflox for gram neg
   coverage. Also consider pneumonia, UTI, although no other localizing
   symptoms. Cardiogenic shock less likely cause of hypotension given lack
   of cardiac symptoms and other signs of infection including fever. Here,
   BP has been responsive to IVF with current SBPs high 90s to 100s.
   - IVF NS at 150cc/hour. Has received 4 liters NS at OSH. Appears
   slightly dry on exam with dry mucus menbranes but pulmonary exam with
   crackles, concern for fluid overload. WIll follow mental status, UOP to
   assess need for IVF resuscitation and continue continuous IVF
   - Daptomycin and Levofloxacin for now for empiric coverage
   - Serial lactate to assess hypoperfusion
   - repeat HCT to assess possible bleed, transfuse PRBC to maintain
   HCT>21 or signs active bleed, check coags
   - Will need to assess need to change line given possible line infection
   - UA, urine cx
   - Follow up blood cx from OSH and repeat blood cx x 2 here
   - Consult ID in am given multiple allergies h/o Micrococcus bacteremia,
   ? appropriate ABx use and duration
   - Renal Ultrasound to assess for hematoma/abscess/fluid collection
   after procedure
   - CEs to ROMI. ECG without acute changes
   - Hold Lisinoprol, home Lasix for now
   - If BP remains low will consider stress dose steroids
   .
   #Fever: Most likely [**2-21**] infection as above but also could have
   inflammatory component given worsening lupus recently, low grade fevers
   x 6months.
   - Fever workup and treat infection as above
   .
   #Pulmonary hypertension: Recent cardiac cath demonstrated severe pulm
   HTN despite Flolan.
   - Continue Flolan
   - Will readd Lasix as BP tolerates, holding for now
   - Off Coumadin until Saturday, will assess for bleed, HCT drop
   - Continue supplemental oxygen to maintain O2 sats >93%
   - Consider addition second [**Doctor Last Name **] as per primary pulmonologist but hold
   for now  given hypotension
   .
   # Lupus nephritis: Patient has lupus nephritis with recent worsening of
   proteinuria, most recently Protein/creatinine ratio 8, improved from
   15-16 [**9-27**].
   - Follow renal function (no labs in system yet today)
   .
   # DM: holding oral hypoglycemics, on ISS
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety: Pt on multiple meds at home. Concern for
   serotonin syndrome given multiple medications and received Linezolid.
   Was going to continue Linezolid but contraindicated with Amitriptyline
   and pt refuses to stop amitriptyline. Per pharmacy, should not
   administer both medications. Linezolid changed to Dapto as per prior
   admission.
   - Continued Cymbalta, amitriptyline, holding Wellbutrin
   .
   #Migraines: Continuing Amitrityline
   .
   # FEN: NPO for renal US
   .
   # PPX: Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis (Questionable h/o HIT) ?why pt
   is on fluconazole will continue for now for presumed fungal PPX, bowel
   regimen
   .
   # ACCESS: Hickman, 20g PIV x 2

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old female with lupus, pulmonary hypertension, and a history of kidney biopsy and recent discharge from the hospital. She is currently admitted to the ICU with hypotension, fever, and respiratory support.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98°F)
* Heart rate: 86 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 128/80 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Dry mucous membranes
* Crackles in the bases of the lungs
* Right chest tunneled Hickman line with mild tenderness
* Obese abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds
* Thinning skin with ecchymoses on the right lower extremity and upper back
