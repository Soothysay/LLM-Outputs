   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo F with DM, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, p/w PNA, intubated in the ED
   .
   # Sepsis: Likely source is PNA given clinical history, leukocytosis
   with bandemia and CXR findings.  Other possiblities include urine or
   bowel.  Patient given 8L NS in ED, CVP 20, SVO2 92, on Levophed.
   Basically, has recieved Early Goal Directed therapy in ED.  Lactate
   6.7, then 2.4 on transfer.  Hct 38.  Then required 3 pressor support
   for MAP > 65.
   - Monitor CVP goal > 12
   - Trend HCT
   - Levophed, Phenylephrine, Vasopressin for MAP > 65
   - Hydrocortisone 100mg IV Q8
   - Follow-up blood / urine culture, daily blood cultures
   - Sputum culture: GPC on gram stain
   - Esophageal balloon for PEEP / CVP monitoring
   - On bicarbonate gtt for profound acidemia
   - Continue Levo/Zosyn, will likely not need more Vanc given oliguria
   - Continue volume resuscitation with 2L D5 Bicarb
   - Consider Zygris
   - f/u urine legionella
   - f/u respiratory viral cx
   - f/u vanc level and re-dose accordingly
   .
   # Respiratory failure [**2-13**] PNA: Community acquired.  Did recently have
   PNA in FL in [**11-19**] and was hospitalized at that time as well.
   Spirometry suggests a restrictive underlying lung disease in [**2111**], does
   have h/o tobacco but no current use per review of OMR.  Blood cultures
   in ED and receieved Vanc / Levo / Flagyl.  Transfered on CMV.  Patient
   did receive PNA in [**Month (only) 1780**].
   - Vanc / Zosyn / Levo for HAP requiring ICU level of care
   - Sputum culture: GPC
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - VAP bundle
   - Consider Ipratroprium / Albuterol if poor ventilation given tobacco
   history
   - Esopagheal balloon for PEEP titration
   .
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: With both lactic acidosis and ketones
   on UA.  No uremia or history of toxic ingestions.  Recieved substantial
   amount of NS in ED. Serum tox negative.  Now with  worsening lactic
   acidosis.
   - Sepsis treatment as above, trend lactic acid
   - Continue IVFs given oliguria
   - Insulin as above
   .
   # Leukopenia: WBC 3.3 with 50% PMNs, 29% bands.  Not neutropenic.
   Likely suppresssed [**2-13**] acute infection.
   - Trend, follow-up diff, ? developing neutropenia
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Decreased since prior but last in [**2110**].  Could be
   [**2-13**] suppression from acute infection or chronic liver disease with
   decreased thrombopoetin.
   - Trend
   - follow DIC labs
   .
   # Mild transaminitis / Elevated INR: Likely [**2-13**] infection, but could be
   med effect, chronic liver disease or poor flow. Serum tox negative.
   - Trend
   .
   # DM: On insulin.  Unclear prior dosing.
   - put on insulin gtt
   - FS QID
   .
   # Anemia:  HCT downward trending
   - trend
   - guaiac all stools
   .
   # Oliguria: Urine output minimal
   - consider CVVH
   .
   # Hypertension: Septic on admission with hypotension requiring
   Levophed.
   - Hold Atenolol
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: h/o [**Doctor Last Name 3691**] disease s/p ablation.
   - Continue Levoxyl IV (1/2 dose po)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia / CAD: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 449**].  On Atorvastatin,
   Aspirin and Atenolol as outpatient.
   - Hold medications until condition improves
   .
   # Elevated CK: Noted previously, but patient also found down for
   unclear duration of time.  Cr stable, has received 8L NS in ED, which
   should be appropriate hydration of any element of rhabdo.
   - Monitor CK trend, Cr
   .
   # FEN: IVF judiciously, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO
   .
   # Prophylaxis: PPI / VAP bundle / Pneumoboots
   .
   # Access:
   18 Gauge - [**2113-3-27**] 09:49 PM
   Multi Lumen - [**2113-3-27**] 10:29 PM
   Arterial Line - [**2113-3-28**] 12:30 AM
   # Code:  Full, ICU consent signed by daughter
   # Communication: Patient / Daughter, [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 5199**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5200**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5201**] (home),

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and thyroid disease, who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with community-acquired pneumonia (PNA). She was intubated in the emergency department (ED) and received invasive ventilation, multi-lumen catheter, and arterial line placement. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, hydrocortisone, and vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65. She has also received fluid resuscitation with 8L of normal saline (NS) in the ED.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues, including:

1. Sepsis: The patient is likely to have sepsis due to her PNA, with a likely source being the pneumonia given her clinical history, leukocytosis with bandemia, and CXR findings.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia with a restrictive underlying lung disease, which requires ICU-level care.
3. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has lactic acidosis and ketones on urine analysis, likely due to her sepsis and inadequate perfusion.
4. Leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell count is low, likely due to suppression from acute infection.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, likely due to suppression from acute infection or chronic liver disease.
6. Mild transaminitis and elevated INR: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, likely due to her infection or medication.
7. Oliguria: The patient has minimal urine output, which may require consideration of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
8. Hypertension: The patient has septic hypertension, which requires management with vasopressors.
9. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which requires ongoing management with levothyroxine.

Potential medical complications that may arise:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury, liver failure, or respiratory failure.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying lung disease and PNA may lead to respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
3. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's lactic acidosis and ketosis may worsen, leading to further acidosis and organ dysfunction.
4. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count and platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding and infection.
5. Oliguria and acute kidney injury: The patient's minimal urine output may lead to acute kidney injury, which may require CRRT.
6. Hypertension and cardiac complications: The patient's septic hypertension may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
7. Hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen, leading to adrenal insufficiency, which may require management with corticosteroids.

The patient requires ongoing management with antibiotics, vasopressors, and supportive care to address her sepsis, respiratory failure, and other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo F with DM, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, p/w PNA, intubated in the ED
   .
   # Sepsis: Likely source is PNA given clinical history, leukocytosis
   with bandemia and CXR findings.  Other possiblities include urine or
   bowel.  Patient given 8L NS in ED, CVP 20, SVO2 92, on Levophed.
   Basically, has recieved Early Goal Directed therapy in ED.  Lactate
   6.7, then 2.4 on transfer.  Hct 38.  Then required 3 pressor support
   for MAP > 65.
   - Monitor CVP goal > 12
   - Trend HCT
   - Levophed, Phenylephrine, Vasopressin for MAP > 65
   - Hydrocortisone 100mg IV Q8
   - Follow-up blood / urine culture, daily blood cultures
   - Sputum culture: GPC on gram stain
   - Esophageal balloon for PEEP / CVP monitoring
   - On bicarbonate gtt for profound acidemia\
   - Continue Levo/Zosyn, will likely not need more Vanc given oliguria
   .
   # Respiratory failure [**2-13**] PNA: Community acquired.  Did recently have
   PNA in FL in [**11-19**] and was hospitalized at that time as well.
   Spirometry suggests a restrictive underlying lung disease in [**2111**], does
   have h/o tobacco but no current use per review of OMR.  Blood cultures
   in ED and receieved Vanc / Levo / Flagyl.  Transfered on CMV.  Patient
   did receive PNA in [**Month (only) 1780**].
   - Zosyn / Levo for HAP requiring ICU level of care
   - Sputum culture: GPC
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - VAP bundle
   - Consider Ipratroprium / Albuterol if poor ventilation given tobacco
   history
   - Esopagheal balloon for PEEP titration
   .
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: With both lactic acidosis and ketones
   on UA.  No uremia or history of toxic ingestions.  Recieved substantial
   amount of NS in ED. Serum tox negative.  Now with  worsening lactic
   acidosis.
   - Sepsis treatment as above, trend lactic acid
   - Judicious IVF given oliguria
   - Insulin as above
   .
   # Leukopenia: WBC 3.3 with 50% PMNs, 29% bands.  Not neutrapenic.
   Likely suppresssed [**2-13**] acute infection.
   - Trend, follow-up diff, ? developing neutrapenia
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Decreased since prior but last in [**2110**].  Could be
   [**2-13**] suppression from acute infection or chronic liver disease with
   decreased thrombopoetin.
   - Trend
   .
   # Mild transaminitis / Elevated INR: Likely [**2-13**] infection, but could be
   med effect, chronic liver disease or poor flow. Serum tox negative.
   - Trend
   .
   # DM: On insulin.  Unclear prior dosing.
   - ISS
   - FS QID
   .
   # Hypertension: Septic on admission with hypotension requiring
   Levophed.
   - Hold Atenolol
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: h/o [**Doctor Last Name 3691**] disease s/p ablation.
   - Continue Levoxyl IV (1/2 dose po)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia / CAD: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 449**].  On Atorvastatin,
   Aspirin and Atenolol as outpatient.
   - Hold medications until condition improves
   .
   # Elevated CK: Noted previously, but patient also found down for
   unclear duration of time.  Cr stable, has received 8L NS in ED, which
   should be appropriate hydration of any element of rhabdo.
   - Monitor CK trend, Cr

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and thyroid disease, who was admitted to the ICU with community-acquired pneumonia (PNA). She was intubated in the emergency department (ED) and received early goal-directed therapy, including fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, and antibiotics. She has been diagnosed with sepsis, respiratory failure, anion gap metabolic acidosis, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, mild transaminitis, and elevated INR.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 103.4°F (39.7°C)
* Heart rate: 100 bpm
* Blood pressure: 116/50 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 32 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 71%
* CVP: 22 mmHg
* Mixed venous O2% saturation: 93-93%

The patient's laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 2.1 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 93 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.04 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 5.1 mmol/L
* Calcium: 6.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 4.6 mg/dL

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Monitoring CVP goal > 12
* Trending HCT
* Levophed, Phenylephrine, and Vasopressin for MAP > 65
* Hydrocortisone 100mg IV Q8
* Follow-up blood and urine cultures
* Sputum culture: GPC on gram stain
* Esophageal balloon for PEEP and CVP monitoring
* On bicarbonate gtt for profound acidemia
* Continue Levo/Zosyn, likely not needing more Vanc given oliguria

Potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her underlying conditions and the presence of PNA.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she requires mechanical ventilation to maintain adequate oxygenation.
3. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis is worsening, and she requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.
4. Leukopenia: The patient's leukopenia may be a sign of bone marrow suppression or infection, and requires close monitoring and management.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may be a sign of bone marrow suppression or infection, and requires close monitoring and management.
6. Mild transaminitis: The patient's mild transaminitis may be a sign of liver dysfunction or infection, and requires close monitoring and management.
7. Elevated INR: The patient's elevated INR may be a sign of liver dysfunction or infection, and requires close monitoring and management.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be a sign of sepsis or other underlying conditions, and requires close monitoring and management.
9. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and requires close monitoring and management.
10. CAD: The patient's CAD may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and requires close monitoring and management.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and medical plan to prevent and manage potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with severe bilateral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 380 mL, PEEP of 18 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 100%. She has been receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and paralytics. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 39.7°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 134/51 mmHg. She has a central venous catheter and an arterial line, and is receiving IV fluids and vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. Her respiratory support is being managed with a ventilator, and her oxygen delivery device is an endotracheal tube.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to worsen if not managed promptly and effectively. The patient is receiving antibiotics, but the sepsis may not be fully controlled, which can lead to further complications such as organ failure and death.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS is likely to worsen if not managed promptly and effectively. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, but the ARDS may not be fully controlled, which can lead to further complications such as respiratory failure and death.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely to worsen if not managed promptly and effectively. The patient is receiving vasopressors, but the hypotension may not be fully controlled, which can lead to further complications such as organ failure and death.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's DKA is likely to worsen if not managed promptly and effectively. The patient is receiving insulin, but the DKA may not be fully controlled, which can lead to further complications such as coma and death.
5. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is likely to occur if not managed promptly and effectively. The patient has a history of cardiac disease and is receiving vasopressors, which can increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen if not managed promptly and effectively. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, but the respiratory failure may not be fully controlled, which can lead to further complications such as respiratory arrest and death.
7. Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy: The patient's sepsis-induced coagulopathy is likely to worsen if not managed promptly and effectively. The patient is receiving anticoagulants, but the coagulopathy may not be fully controlled, which can lead to further complications such as bleeding and death.

Overall, the patient is at high risk of developing further complications if not managed promptly and effectively. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve outcomes."

   Xigris started this afternoon due to severity of sepsis. This was
   discussed ahead of time with her family, esp. with recent history of
   unwitnessed fall and no head CT- they were made aware of the increased
   risk of bleeding on this medicine and still desired that we proceed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is a 73-year-old female who was admitted with severe bilateral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis. She was intubated for respiratory failure and has been receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 380 mL, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 18 cmH2O. The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, pressors, and sedatives.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 39.7°C (103.4°F)
* Heart rate: 93 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 134/51 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 32 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 73%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 2.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 11.6 g/dL
* Platelet count: 93 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 16 mg/dL
* Glucose: 148 mg/dL
* Calcium: 6.1 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 4.6 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypotension: The patient is receiving vasopressors and has a blood pressure of 134/51 mmHg.
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient has marginal oxygenation and ventilation, and is receiving maximal ventilatory support.
* Sepsis: The patient has a diagnosis of sepsis due to CAP, and is receiving antibiotics and Xigris.
* Diabetes mellitus type 2: The patient has a blood glucose level of 148 mg/dL and is receiving insulin infusion.
* Coronary artery disease: The patient is holding medications and has a history of coronary artery disease.
* Hematocrit drop: The patient's hematocrit level is 32.5%, and the cause is likely dilutional.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygenation and ventilation are marginal, and she is at risk for further respiratory failure.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient's blood pressure is low, and she is receiving multiple vasopressors, which increases the risk of cardiac arrest.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is at risk for further renal failure.
* Bleeding: The patient is receiving Xigris, which increases the risk of bleeding.
* Infection: The patient has a diagnosis of sepsis and is at risk for further infection.
* Metabolic acidosis: The patient's blood pH is acidic, and she is at risk for further metabolic acidosis.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old female admitted to the ICU with severe bilateral community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis. She is intubated for worsening respiratory status and has been receiving aggressive ventilatory support, including paralytics, and multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure. She has also been started on Xigris for severe sepsis. The patient has marginal oxygenation and ventilation, persistent acidosis, and is in oliguric renal failure. Her family has been informed of her poor prognosis and has requested aggressive treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may lead to further organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is precarious, and further deterioration may lead to respiratory failure, which could require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or other forms of respiratory support.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's multiple pressors and fluid resuscitation may lead to cardiovascular instability, including hypotension, hypertension, or cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Renal failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure may progress to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, requiring dialysis or other forms of renal replacement therapy.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's persistent acidosis may require further management, including bicarbonate supplementation or other forms of acidosis treatment.
6. Infection-related complications: The patient's sepsis may lead to secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections, which could require additional antibiotics or other forms of treatment.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's multiple pressors and fluid resuscitation may lead to hemodynamic instability, including hypotension, hypertension, or cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's sepsis may lead to neurological complications, including seizures, encephalopathy, or other forms of neurological dysfunction.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's sepsis may lead to gastrointestinal complications, including nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal bleeding.
10. Bleeding complications: The patient's Xigris therapy may increase the risk of bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage or other forms of bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Prophylaxis: DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Further deterioration of respiratory function, leading to increased oxygen requirements and potential respiratory failure
* Development of septic shock, which can lead to cardiovascular collapse and multi-organ failure
* Progression of hyperglycemia, leading to diabetic ketoacidosis or non-ketotic hyperglycemic coma
* Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia
* Potential development of acute kidney injury or acute liver failure
* Increased risk of infection due to prolonged ICU stay and immunosuppression
* Potential development of cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to electrolyte imbalances and cardiac instability."

   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
   Study Date of [**2113-3-28**] 12:50 PM
   Striking and rapid interval progression of bilateral patchy opacity
   with near complete opacification
   of the left hemithorax consistent with airway disease
   ECHO [**3-28**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   and cavity size are normal. There is mild global left ventricular
   hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild global left ventricular hypokinesis with elevated
   estimated filling pressure.
   Assessment and Plan
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   73 yo F with DM, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, p/w PNA, intubated in the ED
   # Sepsis: Likely source is PNA given clinical history, leukocytosis
   with bandemia and CXR findings.  Other possiblities include urine or
   bowel.  Patient given 8L NS in ED, CVP 20, SVO2 92, on Levophed.
   Basically, has recieved Early Goal Directed therapy in ED.  Lactate
   6.7, then 2.4 on transfer from ED.  Hct 38.  Then required 3 pressor
   support for MAP > 65.
   - Monitor CVP goal > 12, bolus as needed
   - Trend HCT, transfuse > 30 PRN
   - Dobutamine, continue for improved SvO2
   - Levophed, Phenylephrine, Vasopressin, Dobutamine for MAP > 65
   - Hydrocortisone 100mg IV Q8
   - Follow-up blood / urine culture, daily blood cultures
   - Sputum culture: GPC on gram stain, no growth
   - Esophageal balloon for PEEP / CVP monitoring
   - On bicarbonate gtt for profound acidemia
   - Continue Levo/Zosyn/Vanc
   - Continue volume resuscitation with 2L D5 Bicarb
   - Zygris
   - f/u urine legionella
   - f/u respiratory viral cx
   - f/u vanc level and re-dose accordingly
   .
   # Respiratory failure [**2-13**] PNA: Community acquired.  Did recently have
   PNA in FL in [**11-19**] and was hospitalized at that time as well.
   Spirometry suggests a restrictive underlying lung disease in [**2111**], does
   have h/o tobacco but no current use per review of OMR.  Blood cultures
   in ED and receieved Vanc / Levo / Flagyl.  Transfered on CMV.  Patient
   did receive PNA in [**Month (only) 1780**].
   - Vanc / Zosyn / Levo for HAP requiring ICU level of care
   - Sputum culture: GPC
   - Follow-up blood cultures
   - VAP bundle
   - Consider Ipratroprium / Albuterol if poor ventilation given tobacco
   history
   - Esopagheal balloon for PEEP titration
   .
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: With both lactic acidosis and ketones
   on UA.  No uremia or history of toxic ingestions.  Recieved substantial
   amount of NS in ED. Serum tox negative.  Now with  worsening lactic
   acidosis.
   - Sepsis treatment as above, trend lactic acid
   - Continue IVFs given oliguria
   - Insulin as above
   .
   # Leukopenia: WBC 3.3 with 50% PMNs, 29% bands.  Not neutropenic.
   Likely suppresssed [**2-13**] acute infection.
   - Trend, follow-up diff, ? developing neutropenia
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Decreased since prior but last in [**2110**].  Could be
   [**2-13**] suppression from acute infection or chronic liver disease with
   decreased thrombopoetin.
   - Trend
   - follow DIC labs
   .
   # Mild transaminitis / Elevated INR: Likely [**2-13**] infection, but could be
   med effect, chronic liver disease or poor flow. Serum tox negative.
   - Trend
   .
   # DM: On insulin.  Unclear prior dosing.
   - put on insulin gtt
   - FS QID
   .
   # Anemia:  HCT downward trending
   - trend
   - guaiac all stools
   .
   # Oliguria: Urine output minimal
   - consider CVVH
   .
   # Hypertension: Septic on admission with hypotension requiring
   Levophed.
   - Hold Atenolol
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: h/o [**Doctor Last Name 3691**] disease s/p ablation.
   - Continue Levoxyl IV (1/2 dose po)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia / CAD: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 449**].  On Atorvastatin,
   Aspirin and Atenolol as outpatient.
   - Hold medications until condition improves
   .
   # Elevated CK: Noted previously, but patient also found down for
   unclear duration of time.  Cr stable, has received 8L NS in ED, which
   should be appropriate hydration of any element of rhabdo.
   - Monitor CK trend, Cr

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Striking and rapid interval progression of bilateral patchy opacity
   with near complete opacification
   of the left hemithorax consistent with airway disease
   ECHO [**3-28**]
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   and cavity size are normal. There is mild global left ventricular
   hypokinesis (LVEF = 45-50 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an
   increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild global left ventricular hypokinesis with elevated
   estimated filling pressure.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a chief complaint of pneumonia, intubated in the emergency department (ED). She has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Her laboratory results show:

* WBC: 3.8-6.6
* Hct: 30.7-34
* Plt: 57-37
* Cr: 2.5-3.2
* TCO2: 22-28
* Glucose: 123-165
* Lactic acid: 6.6 mmol/L
* LDH: 307 IU/L
* Ca++: 6.6 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.7 mg/dL
* PO4: 6.0 mg/dL

She has been diagnosed with sepsis, severe (with organ dysfunction), hypotension (not shock), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and anion gap metabolic acidosis. She has received treatment for these conditions, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and fluids.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 66 and a SpO2 of 73%. She requires mechanical ventilation with a CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode and a PEEP of 20 cmH2O. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.31, pCO2 of 54, and pO2 of 66.

The patient's hemodynamic status is also critical, with a MAP of 65 and a CVP of 23 mmHg. She requires vasopressor support with Levophed, Phenylephrine, and Vasopressin.

The patient's laboratory results also show:

* Leukopenia: WBC 3.3 with 50% PMNs, 29% bands
* Thrombocytopenia: Decreased platelet count
* Mild transaminitis: Elevated liver enzymes
* Elevated INR: 2.7
* Anemia: Decreased hemoglobin level
* Oliguria/Acute Renal Failure: Minimal urine output

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she may require further respiratory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a severe sepsis diagnosis, and she may require further antibiotics and vasopressor support.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's oliguria and elevated creatinine levels suggest acute kidney injury, and she may require further renal support.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's thrombocytopenia and elevated INR suggest a coagulopathy, and she may require further blood product support.
5. Anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis may require further treatment with insulin and bicarbonate.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism may require further treatment with thyroid hormone replacement.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may require further treatment with lipid-lowering agents.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and she requires close monitoring and further treatment to address her multiple medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities and complex medical conditions. The patient's chief complaints include fever, hypotension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Elevated blood glucose levels, consistent with hyperglycemia
* Elevated white blood cell count, indicating sepsis
* Abnormal liver function tests, suggesting liver dysfunction
* Abnormal kidney function tests, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI)
* Abnormal coagulation studies, suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Fever, hypotension, and tachycardia, consistent with sepsis
* Decreased oxygen saturation, indicating respiratory distress
* Decreased urine output, indicating AKI
* Abnormal skin temperature, indicating hypothermia

The patient's medications include:

* Vasopressin for septic shock
* Cisatracurium for muscle relaxation
* Dobutamine for cardiac support
* Midazolam for sedation
* Insulin for glycemic control
* Fentanyl for pain management
* Norepinephrine for blood pressure support
* Phenylephrine for vasopressor support

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Sepsis management, including fluid resuscitation, vasopressor support, and antibiotic therapy
* ARDS management, including mechanical ventilation, prone positioning, and recruitment maneuvers
* Heme management, including transfusion support and coagulation monitoring
* ARF management, including dialysis and fluid management
* Metabolic acidosis management, including bicarbonate administration and acid-base monitoring

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction
* ARDS and acute lung injury
* AKI and acute kidney failure
* DIC and bleeding complications
* Metabolic acidosis and electrolyte imbalances
* Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia
* Cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to ensure timely recognition and management of potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female admitted with influenza B PNA/sepsis and multi-organ failure, including respiratory failure, shock, acidosis, renal failure, coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is critically ill and requires continued pressor support with levophed, vasopressin, neo, and dobutamine. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with ARDS net ventilation and increased PEEP to 20 cmH2O.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is severe and may lead to further organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, cardiovascular instability, and renal failure.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS is severe, and further deterioration is possible, leading to respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, leading to bleeding complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen, leading to bleeding complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes.
6. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia may worsen, leading to further organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.

The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in various parameters, including:

* Elevated white blood cell count (WBC)
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
* Elevated creatinine (Cr)
* Elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN)

   73 yo F with DM, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, p/w PNA, intubated in the ED
   # Sepsis: Likely source is PNA given clinical history, leukocytosis
   with bandemia and CXR findings.  Other possiblities include urine or
   bowel.  Patient given 8L NS in ED, CVP 20, SVO2 92, on Levophed.
   Basically, has recieved Early Goal Directed therapy in ED.  Lactate
   6.7, then 2.4 on transfer from ED.  Hct 38.  Then required 3 pressor
   support for MAP > 65. urine legionella, negative.  Viral studies
   revealed + Influenza B.  Xigris started and stopped for PTT>100, rising
   INR, dropping PLTs.  Cultures thus far only with GPC on sputum gram
   stain but then oropharyngeal flora on culture.  No positive blood
   cultures to date.  Dobutamine started [**3-28**] with improved SvO2, then
   stopped [**3-29**] with concern for NSTEMI.
   - Trend HCT, transfuse > 22 PRN :: transfused [**3-29**] x 2u PRBC
   - Levophed, Phenylephrine, Vasopressin for MAP > 65
   - Hydrocortisone 100mg IV Q8
   - Follow-up blood / urine culture, daily blood cultures
   - Sputum culture: GPC on gram stain, no growth
   - Esophageal balloon for PEEP / CVP monitoring, bolus as needed D5
   Bicarb
   - Continue Levo/Zosyn/Vanc & Tamiflu
   - f/u vanc level and re-dose accordingly
   - Paralyzed, monitoring train of 4
   # Respiratory failure [**2-13**] PNA: Community acquired.  Did recently have
   PNA in FL in [**11-19**] and was hospitalized at that time as well.
   Spirometry suggests a restrictive underlying lung disease in [**2111**], does
   have h/o tobacco but no current use per review of OMR.  Blood cultures
   in ED and receieved Vanc / Levo / Flagyl.  Transfered on CMV.  Patient
   did receive PNA in [**Month (only) 1780**].
   - Vanc / Zosyn / Levo / Tamiflu for HAP requiring ICU level of care
   - Sputum culture: GPC &  follow-up blood cultures
   - Albuterol MDIs
   - Esophageal balloon for PEEP titration
   # NSTEMI & new onset Afib: Patient noted to have ST changes on
   telemetry [**3-29**], soon followed by new onset Afib with RVR.  Troponin
   peaked 1.36.  Likely NSTEMI given severity of general illness.  Afib in
   the setting of ischemia.  Not rate controlling or anticoagulating.
   Holding aspirin, BB; consider restarting Statin.
   - telemetry, consider restart Statin
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: With both lactic acidosis and ketones
   on UA.  history of toxic ingestions.  Recieved substantial amount of NS
   in ED. Serum tox negative.  Now with continued lactic acidosis & some
   uremia.
   - Sepsis treatment as above, trend lactic acid
   - Insulin as above & CVVH per Renal
   # Thrombocytopenia: Decreased since prior but last in [**2110**].  Could be
   [**2-13**] suppression from acute infection or chronic liver disease with
   decreased thrombopoetin. DIC labs negative [**3-28**].
   - Trend, transfuse < 15
   # Mild transaminitis / Elevated INR: Likely [**2-13**] infection, could be med
   effect, chronic liver disease or poor flow. Serum tox (-).
   - Give FFP only if evidence of bleeding or need for procedure (given 2u
   prior to HD line placement [**3-29**])
   # DM: On insulin.  Unclear prior dosing.
   - put on insulin gtt
   - FS Q2H
   # Anemia:  HCT downward trending.  Transfused 2u PRBC [**3-29**].  Also with
   gastro occult positive OG output.
   - trend, transfuse < 22
   # Oliguria / Acute Renal Failure: Urine output minimal.  Renal
   consulted, likely [**2-13**] prerenal / sepsis / ATN.
   - CVVH & Renal recs
   # Hypothyroidism: h/o [**Doctor Last Name 3691**] disease s/p ablation.
   - Continue Levoxyl IV (1/2 dose po)
   # Hyperlipidemia / CAD / Hypertension: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 449**].  On
   Atorvastatin, Aspirin and Atenolol as outpatient.
   - Hold medications until condition improves
   # Elevated CK: Noted previously, but patient also found down for
   unclear duration of time.  Cr stable, has received 8L NS in ED, which
   should be appropriate hydration of any element of rhabdo.
   - Monitor CK trend, Cr

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   73 yo F with DM, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, p/w PNA, intubated in the ED
   # Sepsis: Likely source is PNA given clinical history, leukocytosis
   with bandemia and CXR findings.  Other possiblities include urine or
   bowel.  Patient given 8L NS in ED, CVP 20, SVO2 92, on Levophed.
   Basically, has recieved Early Goal Directed therapy in ED.  Lactate
   6.7, then 2.4 on transfer from ED.  Hct 38.  Then required 3 pressor
   support for MAP > 65. urine legionella, negative.  Viral studies
   revealed + Influenza B.  Xigris started and stopped for PTT>100, rising
   INR, dropping PLTs.  Cultures thus far only with GPC on sputum gram
   stain but then oropharyngeal flora on culture.  No positive blood
   cultures to date.  Dobutamine started [**3-28**] with improved SvO2, then
   stopped [**3-29**] with concern for NSTEMI.
   - Trend HCT, transfuse > 22 PRN :: transfused [**3-29**] x 2u PRBC
   - Levophed, Phenylephrine, Vasopressin for MAP > 65
   - Hydrocortisone 100mg IV Q8
   - Follow-up blood / urine culture, daily blood cultures
   - Sputum culture: GPC on gram stain, no growth
   - Esophageal balloon for PEEP / CVP monitoring, bolus as needed D5
   Bicarb
   - Continue Levo/Zosyn/Vanc & Tamiflu
   - f/u vanc level and re-dose accordingly
   - Paralyzed, monitoring train of 4
   # Respiratory failure [**2-13**] PNA: Community acquired.  Did recently have
   PNA in FL in [**11-19**] and was hospitalized at that time as well.
   Spirometry suggests a restrictive underlying lung disease in [**2111**], does
   have h/o tobacco but no current use per review of OMR.  Blood cultures
   in ED and receieved Vanc / Levo / Flagyl.  Transfered on CMV.  Patient
   did receive PNA in [**Month (only) 1780**].
   - Vanc / Zosyn / Levo / Tamiflu for HAP requiring ICU level of care
   - Sputum culture: GPC &  follow-up blood cultures
   - Albuterol MDIs
   - Esophageal balloon for PEEP titration
   # NSTEMI & new onset Afib: Patient noted to have ST changes on
   telemetry [**3-29**], soon followed by new onset Afib with RVR.  Troponin
   peaked 1.36.  Likely NSTEMI given severity of general illness.  Afib in
   the setting of ischemia.  Not rate controlling or anticoagulating.
   Holding aspirin, BB; consider restarting Statin.
   - telemetry, consider restart Statin
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: With both lactic acidosis and ketones
   on UA.  history of toxic ingestions.  Recieved substantial amount of NS
   in ED. Serum tox negative.  Now with continued lactic acidosis & some
   uremia.
   - Sepsis treatment as above, trend lactic acid
   - Insulin as above & CVVH per Renal
   # Thrombocytopenia: Decreased since prior but last in [**2110**].  Could be
   [**2-13**] suppression from acute infection or chronic liver disease with
   decreased thrombopoetin. DIC labs negative [**3-28**].
   - Trend, transfuse < 15
   # Mild transaminitis / Elevated INR: Likely [**2-13**] infection, could be med
   effect, chronic liver disease or poor flow. Serum tox (-).
   - Give FFP only if evidence of bleeding or need for procedure (given 2u
   prior to HD line placement [**3-29**])
   # DM: On insulin.  Unclear prior dosing.
   - put on insulin gtt
   - FS Q2H
   # Anemia:  HCT downward trending.  Transfused 2u PRBC [**3-29**].  Also with
   gastro occult positive OG output.
   - trend, transfuse < 22
   # Oliguria / Acute Renal Failure: Urine output minimal.  Renal
   consulted, likely [**2-13**] prerenal / sepsis / ATN.
   - CVVH & Renal recs
   # Hypothyroidism: h/o [**Doctor Last Name 3691**] disease s/p ablation.
   - Continue Levoxyl IV (1/2 dose po)
   # Hyperlipidemia / CAD / Hypertension: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 449**].  On
   Atorvastatin, Aspirin and Atenolol as outpatient.
   - Hold medications until condition improves
   # Elevated CK: Noted previously, but patient also found down for
   unclear duration of time.  Cr stable, has received 8L NS in ED, which
   should be appropriate hydration of any element of rhabdo.
   - Monitor CK trend, Cr

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of pneumonia, sepsis, and influenza. The patient's condition has been unstable, with multiple complications arising.

The patient has undergone various interventions, including dialysis, CVVH, and vasopressors, to manage his acute kidney injury, sepsis, and hypotension. Despite these efforts, the patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing respiratory failure, acute lung injury, and hypotension.

The patient's laboratory results indicate significant derangements, including thrombocytopenia, anemia, and hyperglycemia. The patient's electrolyte levels are also abnormal, with elevated potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels.

The patient's physical examination reveals signs of respiratory distress, including tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, and decreased lung sounds. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows tachycardia, and the patient's abdomen is soft and distended.

The patient's medical history is significant for thyroid disease, anemia, and coagulopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory failure and acute lung injury increase the risk of further deterioration in lung function, potentially leading to respiratory arrest.
2. Sepsis: The patient's severe sepsis and organ dysfunction increase the risk of further complications, including multi-organ failure and death.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's ongoing acute kidney injury and need for dialysis increase the risk of further complications, including electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
4. Hypotension: The patient's ongoing hypotension and need for vasopressors increase the risk of further complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and decreased perfusion to vital organs.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia increases the risk of further complications, including decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and increased risk of infection.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia increases the risk of further complications, including increased risk of infection, decreased immune function, and increased risk of cardiovascular events.

Based on the patient's condition and laboratory results, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal function. Additionally, the patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications."

   73 yo F with DM, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, p/w PNA, intubated in the ED
   # Sepsis: Likely source is PNA given clinical history, leukocytosis
   with bandemia and CXR findings.  Other possiblities include urine or
   bowel.  Patient given 8L NS in ED, CVP 20, SVO2 92, on Levophed.
   Basically, has recieved Early Goal Directed therapy in ED.  Lactate
   6.7, then 2.4 on transfer from ED.  Hct 38.  Then required 3 pressor
   support for MAP > 65. urine legionella, negative.  Viral studies
   revealed + Influenza B.  Xigris started and stopped for PTT>100, rising
   INR, dropping PLTs.  Cultures thus far only with GPC on sputum gram
   stain but then oropharyngeal flora on culture.  No positive blood
   cultures to date.  Dobutamine started [**3-28**] with improved SvO2, then
   stopped [**3-29**] with concern for NSTEMI.
   - Trend HCT, transfuse > 22 PRN :: transfused [**3-29**] x 2u PRBC
   - Levophed, Phenylephrine, Vasopressin for MAP > 65
   - Hydrocortisone 100mg IV Q8
   - Follow-up blood / urine culture, daily blood cultures
   - Sputum culture: GPC on gram stain, no growth
   - Esophageal balloon for PEEP / CVP monitoring, bolus as needed D5
   Bicarb
   - Continue Levo/Zosyn/Vanc & Tamiflu
   - f/u vanc level and re-dose accordingly
   - Paralyzed, monitoring train of 4
   # Respiratory failure [**2-13**] PNA: Community acquired.  Did recently have
   PNA in FL in [**11-19**] and was hospitalized at that time as well.
   Spirometry suggests a restrictive underlying lung disease in [**2111**], does
   have h/o tobacco but no current use per review of OMR.  Blood cultures
   in ED and receieved Vanc / Levo / Flagyl.  Transfered on CMV.  Patient
   did receive PNA in [**Month (only) 1780**].
   - Vanc / Zosyn / Levo / Tamiflu for HAP requiring ICU level of care
   - Sputum culture: GPC &  follow-up blood cultures
   - Albuterol MDIs
   - Esophageal balloon for PEEP titration
   # NSTEMI & new onset Afib: Patient noted to have ST changes on
   telemetry [**3-29**], soon followed by new onset Afib with RVR.  Troponin
   peaked 1.36.  Likely NSTEMI given severity of general illness.  Afib in
   the setting of ischemia.  Not rate controlling or anticoagulating.
   Holding aspirin, BB; consider restarting Statin.
   - telemetry, consider restart Statin
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: With both lactic acidosis and ketones
   on UA.  history of toxic ingestions.  Recieved substantial amount of NS
   in ED. Serum tox negative.  Now with continued lactic acidosis & some
   uremia.
   - Sepsis treatment as above, trend lactic acid
   - Insulin as above & CVVH per Renal
   # Thrombocytopenia: Decreased since prior but last in [**2110**].  Could be
   [**2-13**] suppression from acute infection or chronic liver disease with
   decreased thrombopoetin. DIC labs negative [**3-28**].
   - Trend, transfuse < 15
   # Mild transaminitis / Elevated INR: Likely [**2-13**] infection, could be med
   effect, chronic liver disease or poor flow. Serum tox (-).
   - Give FFP only if evidence of bleeding or need for procedure (given 2u
   prior to HD line placement [**3-29**])
   # DM: On insulin.  Unclear prior dosing.
   - put on insulin gtt
   - FS Q2H
   # Anemia:  HCT downward trending.  Transfused 2u PRBC [**3-29**].  Also with
   gastro occult positive OG output.
   - trend, transfuse < 27
   # Oliguria / Acute Renal Failure: Urine output minimal.  Renal
   consulted, likely [**2-13**] prerenal / sepsis / ATN.
   - CVVH & Renal recs
   # Hypothyroidism: h/o [**Doctor Last Name 3691**] disease s/p ablation.
   - Continue Levoxyl IV (1/2 dose po)
   # Hyperlipidemia / CAD / Hypertension: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 449**].  On
   Atorvastatin, Aspirin and Atenolol as outpatient.
   - Hold medications until condition improves
   # Elevated CK: Noted previously, but patient also found down for
   unclear duration of time.  Cr stable, has received 8L NS in ED, which
   should be appropriate hydration of any element of rhabdo.
   - Monitor CK trend, Cr

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and thyroid disease, who was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was intubated in the emergency department and received early goal-directed therapy. Her condition has been complicated by acute renal failure, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and mild transaminitis. She has also developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and NSTEMI with elevated troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, which can lead to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's ARDS can progress to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation and potentially leading to lung injury.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF can worsen kidney function, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and increased risk of morbidity and mortality.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of sepsis and ARF.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia can worsen organ dysfunction, increase the risk of infections, and potentially lead to diabetic ketoacidosis.
6. Mild Transaminitis: The patient's mild transaminitis can be a sign of liver dysfunction, which can worsen with continued sepsis and ARF.
7. NSTEMI: The patient's NSTEMI can progress to acute coronary syndrome, requiring urgent revascularization and potentially leading to cardiac arrest.
8. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can worsen cardiac function, increase the risk of stroke, and potentially lead to cardiac arrest.
9. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's occult gastrointestinal bleeding can worsen anemia, increase the risk of bleeding, and potentially lead to gastrointestinal perforation.
10. Central Nervous System Complications: The patient's sepsis and ARF can increase the risk of central nervous system complications, such as seizures, coma, and brain death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to manage the patient's sepsis and ARDS with antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressors as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider initiating renal replacement therapy if ARF worsens.
3. Manage the patient's thrombocytopenia with platelet transfusions as needed and consider initiating thrombopoietin-stimulating agents.
4. Monitor the patient's hyperglycemia and adjust insulin therapy as needed to maintain euglycemia.
5. Consider initiating anticoagulation therapy for the patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and consider initiating proton pump inhibitors to reduce the risk of further bleeding.
7. Monitor the patient's central nervous system function closely and consider initiating sedation and analgesia as needed to prevent agitation and discomfort."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female admitted with influenza B and Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia (PNA) with sepsis and multi-organ failure. She has developed inferolateral ST elevation in the setting of atrial fibrillation (AF).

The patient is critically ill, requiring multiple life-sustaining interventions, including:

1. Mechanical ventilation (CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow) with PEEP at 25 cmH2O and FiO2 at 70%.
2. Inotropic support with norepinephrine, vasopressin, and phenylephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 mmHg.
3. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) to manage acute kidney injury (AKI) and fluid overload.
4. Sedation with midazolam and fentanyl to manage agitation and pain.
5. Antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, piperacillin, and levofloxacin to cover suspected bacterial PNA and influenza.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Thrombocytopenia, acute, secondary to blood loss and sepsis.
2. Anemia, acute, secondary to blood loss and sepsis.
3. Renal failure, acute, secondary to AKI and sepsis.
4. Hyperglycemia, managed with insulin infusion.
5. Sepsis, severe, with organ dysfunction, requiring continued antibiotic therapy and close monitoring.
6. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), managed with mechanical ventilation and PEEP.
7. NSTEMI, likely, with possible strain in the setting of CVVH.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

1. Thrombocytopenia (platelet count 46-56 x 10^9/L).
2. Anemia (hemoglobin 10.6-13.7 g/dL).
3. Renal failure (creatinine 2.9-3.2 mg/dL).
4. Hyperglycemia (glucose 123-156 mg/dL).
5. Sepsis biomarkers (D-dimer 7262 ng/mL, lactate 7.9 mmol/L).

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Weaning of vent as tolerated.
2. Lightening of sedation.
3. Continuation of steroids (total 5-day course).
4. Narrowing of antibiotic coverage to nafcillin.
5. Continuation of CVVH.
6. Monitoring of patient's response to therapy and adjusting treatment as needed.

In conclusion, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple life-threatening conditions, requiring close monitoring and aggressive treatment to manage her acute respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failures."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The note highlights the patient's recent developments, including:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 46, indicating acute thrombocytopenia.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.6 g/dL, indicating acute anemia, likely secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding).
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 3.2 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure (ARF).
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is 123 mg/dL, indicating hyperglycemia.
5. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, likely caused by bacterial pneumonia and influenza.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 87/56 mmHg, indicating hypotension, but not shock.
7. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has ARDS, likely caused by acute lung injury.
8. NSTEMI: The patient has likely strain in the setting of CVVH, which may be contributing to the development of atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Elevated troponin-T level (1.26 ng/mL)
* Elevated creatine kinase (CK) level (6597 IU/L)
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (307 IU/L)
* Elevated D-dimer level (7262 ng/mL)
* Elevated lactic acid level (7.9 mmol/L)
* Elevated white blood cell count (9.8 x 10^9/L)
* Elevated neutrophil count (77.0%)

The patient's medical history is significant for:

* Hypothyroidism, treated with IV levoxyl
* NSTEMI, likely strain in the setting of CVVH
* Anemia, possibly secondary to upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB)

The patient's current medications include:

* Vancomycin
* Piperacillin
* Levofloxacin
* Norepinephrine
* Vasopressin
* Phenylephrine
* Midazolam (Versed)
* Fentanyl
* Calcium gluconate (CRRT)

The patient's plan includes:

1. Weaning levophed and checking SVV
2. Continuing steroids on day 3
3. Monitoring CV saturation
4. Managing ARDS with PEEP at 25 and titrating down versed and fentanyl
5. Monitoring atrial fibrillation and considering amiodarone if unstable
6. Maintaining hemoglobin level around 30
7. Continuing insulin infusion for glycemic control
8. Monitoring for signs of UGIB
9. Reviewing restraints as needed

The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-inch tall individual who is currently sedated and unresponsive. The patient was admitted with pneumonia and has since developed several complications, including:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped to 59 K/uL, indicating a severe bleeding disorder.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.5 g/dL, indicating severe anemia.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 2.3 mg/dL, indicating acute kidney injury.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is 130 mg/dL, indicating hyperglycemia.
5. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with organ dysfunction.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 87/56 mmHg, indicating hypotension.
7. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient has developed ARDS, which is characterized by acute lung injury.

The patient is currently receiving vasopressin, midazolam, calcium gluconate, fentanyl, and phenylephrine infusions to manage their hemodynamic instability. They are also receiving oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation to support their respiratory status.

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* White blood cell count: 19.7 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 59 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.3 mg/dL
* Glucose: 130 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: Sodium: 134 mEq/L, Potassium: 3.7 mEq/L, Chloride: 94 mEq/L, Bicarbonate: 20 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes a history of thyroid disease and anemia.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Further bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia make them at risk for further bleeding.
2. Renal failure progression: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen if not managed promptly.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS may progress to respiratory failure if not managed effectively.
4. Sepsis progression: The patient's severe sepsis may worsen if not managed promptly.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not managed effectively.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen if not managed promptly.
7. Thrombotic complications: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of thrombotic complications."

 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME (ARDS, ACUTE LUNG INJURY, [**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   73 yo F with DM, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, p/w PNA, intubated in the ED
   # Sepsis: Likely source is PNA given clinical history, leukocytosis
   with bandemia and CXR findings.  Other possiblities include urine or
   bowel.  Patient given 8L NS in ED, CVP 20, SVO2 92, on Levophed.
   Basically, has recieved Early Goal Directed therapy in ED.  Lactate
   6.7, then 2.4 on transfer from ED.  Hct 38.  Then required 3 pressor
   support for MAP > 65. urine legionella, negative.  Viral studies
   revealed + Influenza B.  Xigris started and stopped for PTT>100, rising
   INR, dropping PLTs.  Cultures thus far only with GPC on sputum gram
   stain but then oropharyngeal flora on culture.  No positive blood
   cultures to date.  Dobutamine started [**3-28**] with improved SvO2, then
   stopped [**3-29**] with concern for NSTEMI.
   - Trend HCT, transfuse > 27 PRN (transfused [**3-29**] x 2u PRBC)
   - Levophed, Phenylephrine, Vasopressin for MAP > 65
   - Hydrocortisone 100mg IV Q8
   - Follow-up blood / urine culture,
   - Sputum culture: GPC on gram stain, MSSA
 Naficillin
   - Esophageal balloon for PEEP / CVP monitoring, bolus as needed D5
   Bicarb
   - Continue Levo/Zosyn/Vanc
 narrowed to Nafcillin [**3-30**]
   - Continue Tamiflu
   # Respiratory failure [**2-13**] PNA: Community acquired.  Did recently have
   PNA in FL in [**11-19**] and was hospitalized at that time as well.
   Spirometry suggests a restrictive underlying lung disease in [**2111**], does
   have h/o tobacco but no current use per review of OMR.  Blood cultures
   in ED and receieved Vanc / Levo / Flagyl.  Transfered on CMV.  Patient
   did receive PNA in [**Month (only) 1780**].
   - Vanc / Zosyn / Levo / Tamiflu for HAP requiring ICU level of care
   - Sputum culture: GPC / MSSA &  follow-up blood cultures
   - Albuterol MDIs
   - Esophageal balloon for PEEP titration
   # NSTEMI & new onset Afib: Patient noted to have ST changes on
   telemetry [**3-29**], soon followed by new onset Afib with RVR.  Troponin
   peaked 1.36.  Likely NSTEMI given severity of general illness.  Afib in
   the setting of ischemia.  Not rate controlling or anticoagulating.
   Holding aspirin, BB; consider restarting Statin.
   - telemetry, consider restart statin in future
   # Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis: With both lactic acidosis and ketones
   on UA.  history of toxic ingestions.  Recieved substantial amount of NS
   in ED. Serum tox negative.  Now with continued lactic acidosis & some
   uremia.
   - Sepsis treatment as above, trend lactic acid
   - Insulin as above & CVVH per Renal
   # Thrombocytopenia: Decreased since prior but last in [**2110**].  Could be
   [**2-13**] suppression from acute infection or chronic liver disease with
   decreased thrombopoetin. DIC labs negative [**3-28**].
   - Trend, transfuse < 15
   # Mild transaminitis / Elevated INR: Likely [**2-13**] infection, could be med
   effect, chronic liver disease or poor flow. Serum tox (-).
   - Give FFP only if evidence of bleeding or need for procedure (given 2u
   prior to HD line placement [**3-29**])
   # DM: On insulin.  Unclear prior dosing.
   - put on insulin gtt
   - FS Q1H
   # Anemia:  HCT downward trending.  Transfused 2u PRBC [**3-29**].  Also with
   gastro occult positive OG output.
   - trend, transfuse < 27
   # Oliguria / Acute Renal Failure: Urine output minimal.  Renal
   consulted, likely [**2-13**] prerenal / sepsis / ATN.
   - CVVH & Renal recs
   # Hypothyroidism: h/o [**Doctor Last Name 3691**] disease s/p ablation.
   - Continue Levoxyl IV (1/2 dose po)
   # Hyperlipidemia / CAD / Hypertension: Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 449**].  On
   Atorvastatin, Aspirin and Atenolol as outpatient.
   - Hold medications until condition improves
   # Elevated CK: Noted previously, but patient also found down for
   unclear duration of time.  Cr stable, has received 8L NS in ED, which
   should be appropriate hydration of any element of rhabdo.
   - Monitor CK trend, Cr
   # FEN: IVF PRN, replete electrolytes PRN, NPO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and thyroid disease, who was admitted to the ICU with community-acquired pneumonia (PNA), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis. She was intubated in the emergency department (ED) and received early goal-directed therapy. She has a history of tobacco use, but is currently not using tobacco. Her laboratory results show thrombocytopenia, acute anemia, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, and elevated CK levels. She also has a history of NSTEMI and new onset atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is at risk for further deterioration.
2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely caused by her PNA, and she is at risk for further complications such as organ dysfunction and death.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she is at risk for bleeding complications.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's kidney function is compromised, and she is at risk for further deterioration and the need for dialysis.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood sugar levels are high, and she is at risk for further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.
6. NSTEMI: The patient's cardiac status is compromised, and she is at risk for further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is new onset, and she is at risk for further complications such as stroke and cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia is acute and severe, and she is at risk for further complications such as cardiac dysfunction and respiratory failure.
9. Elevated CK levels: The patient's CK levels are elevated, and she is at risk for further complications such as rhabdomyolysis and cardiac dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's sepsis with antibiotics and supportive care.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count and transfuse platelets as needed.
4. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure with dialysis and supportive care.
5. Monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and adjust her insulin therapy as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust her medication therapy as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust her medication therapy as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and transfuse blood products as needed.
9. Monitor the patient's CK levels and adjust her medication therapy as needed."

s note above, and would add: 73 yo female admitted with influenza
   B and MSSA PNA and sepsis resulting in multiorgan failure with acute
   respiratory failure, septic shock, acute renal failure. Over the past
   day, fiO2 requirement has decreased slightly, still requiring high
   levels of ventilatory support. Down to 2 pressors, but hemodynamics
   have been too tenuous to remove fluid through CVVHD, resulting in net
   ~30 liters positive since hospitalization.  Plans are to continue
   ventilator but attempt to decrease PEEP, use of pressors to maintain
   MAP>65, pan culture (has rising WBC this morning). Remains on nafcillin
   for MSSA.
   Conference was held with pt
s daughters, [**Name (NI) **] and [**Name (NI) 5199**], this
   afternoon, during which we discussed pt
s status and overall outlook.
   Even if she survives her hospitalization for severe sepsis,
   realistically the recovery process will be protracted, involving at
   best  trach/PEG and months in recovery, with unclear recovery of renal
   function and mental status. They felt that this scenario was not one
   that the patient would have been interested in, yet among the daughters
   there were differences in how ready they felt to change the goals of
   care, including the issue of resuscitation in case of a cardiac arrest.
   Will continue to support the family as they come to grips with her
   critically ill situation.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 85 minutes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

s note above, and would add: 73 yo female admitted with influenza
   B and MSSA PNA and sepsis resulting in multiorgan failure with acute
   respiratory failure, septic shock, acute renal failure. Over the past
   day, fiO2 requirement has decreased slightly, still requiring high
   levels of ventilatory support. Down to 2 pressors, but hemodynamics
   have been too tenuous to remove fluid through CVVHD, resulting in net
   ~30 liters positive since hospitalization.  Plans are to continue
   ventilator but attempt to decrease PEEP, use of pressors to maintain
   MAP>65, pan culture (has rising WBC this morning). Remains on nafcillin
   for MSSA.

   Even if she survives her hospitalization for severe sepsis,
   realistically the recovery process will be protracted, involving at
   best  trach/PEG and months in recovery, with unclear recovery of renal
   function and mental status. They felt that this scenario was not one
   that the patient would have been interested in, yet among the daughters
   there were differences in how ready they felt to change the goals of
   care, including the issue of resuscitation in case of a cardiac arrest.
   Will continue to support the family as they come to grips with her

Summary:

The patient is a 73-year-old female admitted with influenza B and MSSA pneumonia, sepsis, and multi-organ failure. She is currently in the ICU and is critically ill. Her vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.5°C
* Heart rate: 69 bpm
* Blood pressure: 87/56 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 34 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 89%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient is receiving various medications, including vasopressin, calcium gluconate, phenylephrine, and fentanyl. She is also receiving antibiotics, including nafcillin, and is being treated for sepsis.

The patient has a history of acute thrombocytopenia, anemia, and renal failure. Her laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 92 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 24 mEq/L
* Glucose: 130 mg/dL

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury. Her ABG results show:

* pH: 7.33
* PaO2: 192 mmHg
* PaCO2: 46 mmHg
* HCO3: 115 mmol/L

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Sepsis: Weaned off levophed, may need more neo to run CVVH
* ARDS: Decrease PEEP to 22, check ABGs q6h, sedation holiday then restart at 20% less
* NSTEMI: CE trending down, recheck CE
* Hyperglycemia: Off insulin gtt, SSI

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis: May lead to further organ dysfunction and death
* ARDS: May lead to respiratory failure and death
* Renal failure: May lead to further organ dysfunction and death
* Thrombocytopenia: May lead to bleeding complications
* Anemia: May lead to further organ dysfunction and death
* Hyperglycemia: May lead to further organ dysfunction and death

The patient's family is being supported and counseled regarding her critically ill situation. The patient's daughters are having difficulty coming to terms with her prognosis and are struggling with the decision of whether to continue aggressive care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities, including acute thrombocytopenia, anemia secondary to blood loss, acute renal failure, hyperglycemia, sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypotension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 69 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 87/56 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is supported with mechanical ventilation, and oxygen saturation is maintained at 89%.

The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including piperacillin-tazobactam, levofloxacin, vancomycin, and nafcillin, for suspected infections. The patient's blood products, including packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets, have been transfused to support hemostasis and anemia.

The patient's laboratory results indicate acute kidney injury, with a creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL, and hyperglycemia, with a blood glucose level of 130 mg/dL. The patient's inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein and white blood cell count, are elevated.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy.
2. Acute kidney injury progression to end-stage renal disease.
3. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, including cardiac, respiratory, and neurological compromise.
4. ARDS progression to respiratory failure.
5. Hypotension and shock.
6. Infections, including pneumonia and central line-associated bloodstream infections.
7. Hyperglycemic complications, including ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.

To address these potential complications, the patient's care plan includes:

1. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies.
2. Administration of antibiotics, anticoagulants, and vasopressors as needed.
3. Blood product transfusions to support hemostasis and anemia.
4. Renal replacement therapy, including continuous venovenous hemofiltration, to support kidney function.
5. Glycemic control with insulin therapy.
6. Sedation holiday and pain management to promote comfort and minimize respiratory and cardiovascular compromise.
7. Family meeting to discuss the patient's condition, treatment options, and prognosis."
