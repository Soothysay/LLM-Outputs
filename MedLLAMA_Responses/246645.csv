   CONCLUSION:
   Extensive artifact from dental amalgam limits evaluation.
   1. Enlarged enhancing left submandibular gland with two calculi in the
   whartons duct and extensive surrounding inflammatory change in the
   subcutaneous tissues. The appearances are consistent with left
   submandibular
   sialadenitis secondary to obstructive sialoliths.
   2. Several borderline lymph nodes at all stations within the neck as
   described above.

   # Left Facial Swelling:  Patient with left submandibular gland
   infection and large [**Location (un) 7930**] duct stone.  The patient is at risk for
   Ludwig's angina given rate of progression of infection (over 1 day) and
   given that infection already involves left submandibular space, and
   sublingual space.  Has been seen by ENT in ED, without evidence of
   airway compromise.  No evidence of laryngal swelling on scope.  Has
   received antibiotics in ED and one time dose of dexamethasone.  No
   current plans for surgical intervention, but ENT will assess in the
   morning.
   - cont vanc/unasyn for GN, GP, and anderobic coverage and follow up
   gland cultures
   - [**Doctor Last Name 7931**] wedges and salivary massage to help stimulate secretions
   - HOB elevated at 30 degrees
   - fiberoptic airway [**Last Name (LF) 7932**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] assess for acute decomensation for
   need for nasal fiberoptic airways vs. trach.  Will monitor for
   increased salivation, dysphagia, or stridor.
   - will dose addition IV dex if e/o airway compromise.
   -  Humdified shovel mask
   -  NPO and aggressive IV hydration
   -  holding coumadin but putting on heparin bridge in case goes to OR.
   Will need to reverse with FFP if emergent surgery planned.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a complex medical history, including SLE, SLE nephritis, and APLS (PE/renal vein clots) on warfarin. She was admitted to the ICU with left facial swelling and a large obstructing salivary duct stone with gland inflammation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, and blood pressure of 158/95 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 96% on an aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, with a normal head, ears, nose, and throat examination. Her peripheral vascular examination is limited due to the absence of radial and digital pulses. Her skin examination is not assessed, and her neurologic examination reveals normal responses.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.3 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 11.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 173 K/μL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 140 mg/dL
* PT/PTT/INR: 28.4/150.0/2.9

The patient's CTA neck shows a large salivary stone with infection underneath, consistent with left submandibular sialadenitis secondary to obstructive sialoliths.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ludwig's angina: Given the rapid progression of infection and the involvement of the left submandibular space and sublingual space, the patient is at risk for Ludwig's angina.
2. Airway compromise: The patient's facial swelling and potential vocal cord edema increase the risk of airway compromise.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and her oxygen saturation is dependent on supplemental oxygen.
4. Sepsis: The patient's infection and inflammatory response increase the risk of sepsis.
5. Renal failure: The patient's pre-existing renal disease and potential nephrotoxicity from antibiotics increase the risk of renal failure.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's coagulopathy and anticoagulation therapy increase the risk of bleeding complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued antibiotics for GN, GP, and anaerobic coverage
* Salivary gland massage to stimulate secretions
* Elevation of the head of bed to 30 degrees
* Fiberoptic airway assessment for acute decompression
* Humidified oxygen therapy
* NPO and aggressive IV hydration
* Holding coumadin and starting heparin bridge
* Reversal of heparin with FFP if emergent surgery is planned
* Follow-up with ENT and ID consultation

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of SLE, APA, and lupus, who was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of left submandibular gland infection and a large obstructing salivary duct stone. The patient is at risk for Ludwig's angina due to the rapid progression of infection and the involvement of the left submandibular and sublingual spaces.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, and blood pressure of 158/95 mmHg. The patient is receiving antibiotics, heparin, and morphine for pain control.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Left submandibular gland infection and sialadenitis secondary to obstructive sialoliths, which may lead to Ludwig's angina.
2. Acute pain, which is being managed with morphine.
3. Risk of aspiration due to dysphagia and altered gag reflex.
4. Respiratory support with oxygen delivery and humidified mask.
5. Potential bleeding risk due to anticoagulation therapy.
6. Risk of infection due to the presence of a central line and the patient's immunosuppressed state.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 9.3 K/uL
* Hct: 33.5%
* Plt: 173 K/uL
* Cr: 1.0 mg/dL
* TropT: <0.01
* Glucose: 140 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 28.4/150.0/2.9, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 69/<0.01, Ca++: 8.8 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.5 mg/dL, PO4: 2.6 mg/dL

The patient's radiology results show:

* CTA Neck: Enlarged enhancing left submandibular gland with two calculi in the Wharton's duct and extensive surrounding inflammatory change in the subcutaneous tissues.

The patient's plan includes:

* Continued antibiotics for GN, GP, and anaerobic coverage
* Fiberoptic airway assessment for acute decompression
* Monitoring for increased salivation, dysphagia, or stridor
* Holding coumadin and starting heparin bridge
* Reversing with FFP if emergent surgery planned
* IV morphine for pain control
* NPO and aggressive IV hydration
* Follow-up with ENT and ID early in the morning

In summary, the patient is at risk for several medical complications, including Ludwig's angina, aspiration, bleeding, and infection. The patient's plan includes continued antibiotics, fiberoptic airway assessment, and monitoring for respiratory and cardiac complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of SLE, APA, and PE on coumadin, admitted to the ICU with a large obstructing salivary duct stone and gland inflammation. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 158/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving antibiotics, including Ampicillin/Sulbactam and Vancomycin, and is being monitored for potential complications.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and troponin levels, indicating an inflammatory response and potential cardiac injury. The patient's liver enzymes are also elevated, suggesting possible liver injury.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal neurological function, and no evidence of airway compromise. However, the patient has a history of facial swelling and is at risk for Ludwig's angina due to the rapid progression of infection.

The patient is receiving various treatments, including antibiotics, IV fluids, and pain management. The patient is also being monitored for potential complications, such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of facial swelling and risk of Ludwig's angina puts them at risk for respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's elevated troponin levels and history of PE on coumadin suggest a potential risk for cardiac arrest.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, as well as the presence of a large salivary duct stone, put them at risk for sepsis.
4. Liver injury: The patient's elevated liver enzymes suggest possible liver injury, which could worsen if not addressed promptly.
5. Renal failure: The patient's history of glomerularnephritis and elevated creatinine levels put them at risk for renal failure.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to identify any potential complications early and initiate prompt treatment to prevent further deterioration."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of SLE, APA, and PE. She is currently in the ICU with a large obstructing salivary duct stone and gland inflammation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.6°F (38.7°C), blood pressure of 122/65 mmHg, heart rate of 82 bpm, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.3 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 33.5%
* Platelet count: 173 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* TropT: <0.01
* Glucose: 122 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 23.5/108.5/2.3, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 69/<0.01/<0.01, Ca++: 9.1 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.6 mg/dL, PO4: 4.0 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is notable for left facial swelling and tenderness, which is thought to be related to the salivary duct stone.

The patient's medical history is significant for PE, renal vein thrombosis, lupus, glomerulonephritis, depression, GERD, and FEN.

The patient's current medications include:

* Vancomycin
* Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn)
* Heparin Sodium
* Morphine Sulfate
* Prednisone
* Hydrochlorquine
* Lisinopril
* Prozac
* PPI

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuation of vancomycin and Unasyn for GN, GP, and anaerobic coverage
* Follow-up gland cultures
* ENT consultation to re-evaluate the airway and consider drainage
* HOB elevation at 30 degrees
* Humidified oxygen therapy
* Holding coumadin and starting heparin bridge
* IV morphine for pain control

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of the patient's airway obstruction
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Bleeding complications related to the patient's coagulopathy
* Renal failure or worsening of glomerulonephritis
* Cardiovascular complications related to the patient's history of PE and renal vein thrombosis
* Infection or abscess formation related to the salivary duct stone
* Neurological complications related to the patient's history of lupus and glomerulonephritis"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

* The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of SLE, APA, and PE on coumadin, who presented with 4 days of left facial swelling and was found to have a large obstructing salivary duct stone with gland inflammation.
* The patient has been experiencing inc pain and increased frequency of morphine dose in the afternoon.
* The patient's temperature spiked to 101.6°F at 8:00 PM, and blood and urine cultures were sent.
* The patient has a history of glomerularnephritis, which is significantly improved on cellcept.
* The patient is being treated with IV abx, including vancomycin and ampicillin/sulbactam, for GN, GP, and anaerobic coverage.
* The patient is also being treated with heparin for DVT prophylaxis and coumadin is being held and replaced with heparin bridge in case of emergent surgery.
* The patient has a history of depression, GERD, and FEN, and is being treated with corresponding medications.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 122/65 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
* The patient's physical examination is notable for left facial and neck swelling and tenderness, with no acute distress or stridor.
* The patient's labs show evidence of infection, with WBC count of 9.3 and 10.6, Hct of 33.5 and 32.1, and Plt count of 173 and 175.
* The patient's plan includes continued treatment with IV abx, heparin, and morphine for pain control, as well as ongoing management of their underlying medical conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to the patient's underlying infection and compromised immune system.
* Airway compromise due to the patient's facial swelling and potential airway obstruction.
* Bleeding complications due to the patient's history of PE and coumadin use.
* Infection-related kidney injury or worsening of glomerularnephritis.
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying lung disease and potential airway compromise.
* Cardiovascular complications due to the patient's history of PE and anticoagulation therapy.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to the patient's history of GERD and potential increased risk of bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a complex medical history, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APA), and a history of pulmonary embolism (PE). She was admitted to the ICU with left facial swelling and was found to have a large obstructing salivary duct stone with gland inflammation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.6°F (38.7°C), heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure of 122/65 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a SpO2 of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and creatinine levels. She has been treated with vancomycin and ampicillin/sulbactam for suspected sepsis, and is also receiving heparin therapy for anticoagulation.

The patient's physical examination is notable for left facial swelling and tenderness, with no acute distress. She is awake and follows simple commands, but her neurological examination is otherwise incomplete due to her medical condition.

The patient's medical plan includes continued treatment with vancomycin and ampicillin/sulbactam for suspected sepsis, as well as anticoagulation therapy with heparin. She is also receiving morphine for pain control and has been prescribed decadron for potential use in the operating room.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Airway compromise due to the large salivary duct stone and gland inflammation.
2. Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's suspected infection.
3. Pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis due to her history of PE and anticoagulation therapy.
4. Renal failure or worsening of her existing kidney disease due to the patient's underlying medical condition and treatment with nephrotoxic medications.
5. Respiratory failure or worsening of her existing respiratory disease due to the patient's underlying medical condition and treatment with corticosteroids.

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent or manage these potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of SLE, APA, and glomerularnephritis, currently admitted to the ICU with a large obstructing salivary duct stone and gland inflammation. The patient has been experiencing left facial swelling, incision pain, and fever.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 101.6°F, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 122/65 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving IV antibiotics, heparin, and morphine for pain control.

The patient has a history of coumadin use and is currently on a heparin bridge due to the risk of bleeding. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and increased Cr levels.

The patient's airway is stable, and the ENT physician has recommended transferring the patient to the floor if the airway remains stable. However, the patient's facial swelling and pain may require further evaluation and management.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory compromise: The patient's facial swelling and airway instability may lead to respiratory compromise, requiring close monitoring and potential interventions such as non-invasive ventilation or intubation.
2. Infection: The patient's facial swelling and gland inflammation may indicate a severe infection, requiring prompt antibiotic therapy and further evaluation.
3. Bleeding: The patient's history of coumadin use and current heparin therapy may increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of facial swelling and potential surgical intervention.
4. Renal impairment: The patient's history of glomerularnephritis and current Cr levels may indicate ongoing renal impairment, requiring close monitoring and potential interventions such as dialysis.
5. Airway compromise: The patient's facial swelling and airway instability may lead to airway compromise, requiring prompt evaluation and potential interventions such as intubation.

Based on the patient's condition, further evaluation and management are necessary to address the potential medical complications and optimize the patient's care."
