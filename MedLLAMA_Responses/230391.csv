   Assessment and Plan
   This [**Age over 90 **]M with CAD, dementia, afib, and prior strokes presents with
   hypotension and respiratory distress.
   1. Sepsis, pna
   Most likely pulmonary source, though consider also line infection
   (uncertain when PICC was placed). UTI also a consideration, though no
   bacteria on UA here. Given prior strokes at risk for aspiration.
   - continue empiric vancomycin, zosyn, and cipro for HAP coverage
   - culture blood, urine, sputum. need peripheral blood cx and PICC cx.
   check urine legionella ag. follow up outside micro.
   - clarify when PICC was placed
   - CVP goal of 10 with IV NS PRN
   - levophed to maintain map>65
   - check SVO2 goal >70
   - attempt to ventilate per ardsnet, but patient had wild swings in
   tidal volume.  Placed patient on PS and did much better
   - Monitor ABG
   .
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Patient was likely pre-renal with decreased PO intake, very likely to
   have developed ATN in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - holding ACEI
   - urine lytes, eosinophils
   - renal recs appreciated, may need CVVH, at this point not indicated
   .
   3. Hypernatremia
   High sodium in the setting of poor PO intake, increased free H20 loss
   in the setting of fever. Estimated free water deficit ~4.6L
   - start D5W @ 125/hr to correct for water deficit and ongoing losses,
   changed overnight to D51/2 NS and then converted back to D5W.
   - follow Na q4hrs goal 0.5meq/hr correction
   - Start TF today with free water flushes to attempt to correct sodium
   and decrease need for IV therapy
   .
   4. Acidosis
   Mixed disturbance; non-gap acidosis [**1-17**] fluid resuscitation and gap
   acidosis probably related to renal failure with additional contribution
   from mildly elevated lactate at admission
   -          hold off on further saline, will use LR if needs additional
   volume resuscitation
   -          Avoid changing vent to increase RR and decrease CO2 as
   previously mentioned
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Now in SR, RVR likely provoked by catecholaminergic state of sepsis
   - continue amiodarone drip x24hrs per cards recs-last dose 2 PM today,
   will consider transitioning back to metoprolol subsequently, if not on
   pressure support and able to tolerate
   - not on anticoagulation
   - can recheck TSH though interpretation may be clouded by current
   illness
   .
   6. Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 1.8 but per records not on anticoagulation. In setting
   of infection must consider DIC but this seems less likely. Nutritional
   deficiency may be more likely.
   - Trend INR, no need to give vitamin K at this time
   - Followup smear, FDP, D-dimer- no evidence of DIC
   .
   7. CAD
   Patient's admission EKG with STD/TWI, most likely demand ischemia in
   setting of rapid rate. Tropn elevated but renal failure also
   complicates interpretation.
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes x2-elevated, but peaked
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 325
   .
   8. Anemia
   Hct 37 at admission was above recent baseline of ~33 likely reflecting
   hemoconcentration decrease to 32 on repeat today follows significant
   IVF resuscitation. No evidence of active bleeding
   - Follow Hct, coags, type and screen active
   .
   9. Tongue twitching
   ?Unmasking of old stroke in setting of infection. Consider also
   seizure.
   - Per Neuro start Keppra and continue to monitor, will consider need
   for long term treatment given other co-morbidities and prognosis
   .
   10. Depression
   - Holding remeron given altered mental status
   .
   11. Glaucoma
   - Continue home eye drops

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Mixed disturbance; non-gap acidosis [**1-17**] fluid resuscitation and gap
   acidosis probably related to renal failure with additional contribution
   from mildly elevated lactate at admission
   -          hold off on further saline, will use LR if needs additional
   volume resuscitation
   -          Avoid changing vent to increase RR and decrease CO2 as
   previously mentioned
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Now in SR, RVR likely provoked by catecholaminergic state of sepsis
   - continue amiodarone drip x24hrs per cards recs-last dose 2 PM today,
   will consider transitioning back to metoprolol subsequently, if not on
   pressure support and able to tolerate
   - not on anticoagulation
   - can recheck TSH though interpretation may be clouded by current
   illness
   .
   6. Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 1.8 but per records not on anticoagulation. In setting
   of infection must consider DIC but this seems less likely. Nutritional
   deficiency may be more likely.
   - Trend INR, no need to give vitamin K at this time
   - Followup smear, FDP, D-dimer- no evidence of DIC
   .
   7. CAD
   Patient's admission EKG with STD/TWI, most likely demand ischemia in
   setting of rapid rate. Tropn elevated but renal failure also
   complicates interpretation.
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes x2-elevated, but peaked
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 325
   .
   8. Anemia
   Hct 37 at admission was above recent baseline of ~33 likely reflecting
   hemoconcentration decrease to 32 on repeat today follows significant
   IVF resuscitation. No evidence of active bleeding
   - Follow Hct, coags, type and screen active
   .
   9. Tongue twitching
   ?Unmasking of old stroke in setting of infection. Consider also
   seizure.
   - Per Neuro start Keppra and continue to monitor, will consider need
   for long term treatment given other co-morbidities and prognosis
   .
   10. Depression
   - Holding remeron given altered mental status
   .
   11. Glaucoma
   - Continue home eye drops

   Disposition: ICU<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, dementia, atrial fibrillation, and prior strokes. He was admitted to the ICU with hypotension and respiratory distress.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Sepsis, likely pulmonary in origin, with a possible line infection or urinary tract infection.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure, likely caused by pre-renal failure and decreased PO intake.
3. Hypernatremia, likely caused by poor PO intake and increased free water loss.
4. Acidosis, likely caused by a mixed disturbance, including non-gap acidosis from fluid resuscitation and gap acidosis from renal failure.
5. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has resolved to sinus rhythm.
6. Coagulopathy, likely caused by nutritional deficiency rather than disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
7. Coronary artery disease, with recent elevation of cardiac enzymes.
8. Anemia, likely caused by hemoconcentration and decreased PO intake.
9. Tongue twitching, possibly caused by unmasking of an old stroke or seizure.
10. Depression, with altered mental status.
11. Glaucoma, requiring continued home eye drops.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued sepsis and organ dysfunction
* Worsening renal failure and acidosis
* Hypernatremia and dehydration
* Coagulopathy and bleeding
* Atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response
* Coronary artery disease and cardiac complications
* Anemia and bleeding
* Tongue twitching and seizure
* Depression and altered mental status
* Glaucoma and visual complications

The patient's current medications include:

* Norepinephrine
* Fentanyl
* Amiodarone
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Piperacillin-Tazobactam (Zosyn)
* Ciprofloxacin
* Vancomycin

The patient's current treatments and plans include:

* Empiric antibiotics for pneumonia and sepsis
* Cardiac enzymes and monitoring for cardiac complications
* Renal dose medications for acute renal failure
* Fluid resuscitation and electrolyte management for hypernatremia and acidosis
* Monitoring for coagulopathy and bleeding
* Continued eye drops for glaucoma
* Monitoring for tongue twitching and seizure

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including pneumonia, sepsis, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, chronic anemia, coronary artery disease, and mixed acidosis. The patient is currently receiving invasive ventilation, and various medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and anti-arrhythmic agents. The patient's vital signs are stable, but their hemodynamic monitoring suggests a possible pressor requirement.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP.
2. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's sepsis may progress to organ dysfunction, such as acute kidney injury or liver failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, requiring further interventions, such as dialysis.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's atrial fibrillation and possible pressor requirement increase the risk of cardiovascular instability, including arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may worsen, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may exacerbate their neurological symptoms and increase the risk of seizures.
7. Acidosis: The patient's mixed acidosis may worsen, potentially leading to further organ dysfunction.
8. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and sepsis increase the risk of developing secondary infections, such as urinary tract infections or central line-associated bloodstream infections.
9. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's prolonged ICU stay may lead to nutritional deficiencies, including protein-calorie malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's condition to prevent or minimize their impact."

   Assessment and Plan
   This [**Age over 90 **]M with CAD, dementia, afib, and prior strokes presents with
   hypotension and respiratory distress.
   1. Sepsis, pna
   Most likely pulmonary source, though consider also line infection
   (uncertain when PICC was placed). UTI also a consideration, though no
   bacteria on UA here. Given prior strokes at risk for aspiration.
   - empiric vancomycin, zosyn, and cipro for HAP coverage
   - culture blood, urine, sputum. need peripheral blood cx and PICC cx.
   check urine legionella ag. follow up outside micro.
   - clarify when PICC was placed
   - CVP now ~10 so will hold off on additonal fluid resuscitation, target
   [**7-27**]
   - levophed to maintain map>65
   - check SVO2 goal >70
   - ventilate per ardsnet
   .
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Patient was likely pre-renal with decreased PO intake, very likely to
   have developed ATN in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - holding ACEI
   - urine lytes, eosinophils
   - renal recs appreciated, may need CVVH
   .
   3. Hypernatremia
   High sodium in the setting of poor PO intake, increased free H20 loss
   in the setting of fever. Estimated free water deficit ~4.6L
   - start D5W @ 125/hr to correct for water deficit and ongoing losses
   - follow Na q4hrs goal 0.5meq/hr correction
   .
   4. Acidosis
   Mixed disturbance; non-gap acidosis [**1-17**] fluid resuscitation and gap
   acidosis probably related to renal failure with additional contribution
   from mildly elevated lactate at admission
   - hold off on further saline, will use LR if needs additional volume
   resuscitation
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Now in SR, RVR likely provoked by catecholaminergic state of sepsis
   - continue amiodarone drip x24hrs per cards recs, will consider
   transitioning back to metoprolol subsequently
   - not on anticoagulation
   - can recheck TSH though interpretation may be clouded by current
   illness
   .
   6. Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 1.8 but per records not on anticoagulation. In setting
   of infection must consider DIC but this seems less likely. Nutritional
   deficiency may be more likely.
   - Trend INR, no need to give vitamin K at this time
   - Followup smear, FDP, D-dimer
   .
   7. CAD
   Patient's admission EKG with STD/TWI, most likely demand ischemia in
   setting of rapid rate. Tropn elevated but renal failure also
   complicates interpretation.
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes x2
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 325
   .
   8. Anemia
   Hct 37 at admission was above recent baseline of ~33 likely reflecting
   hemoconcentration decrease to 32 on repeat today follows significant
   IVF resuscitation. No evidence of active bleeding
   - Follow Hct, coags, type and screen active
   .
   9. Tongue twitching
   ?Unmasking of old stroke in setting of infection. Consider also
   seizure.
   - D/w neuro re further eval ?role for keppra
   .
   10. Depression
   - Holding remeron given altered mental status
   .
   11. Glaucoma
   - Continue home eye drops

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of CAD, dementia, afib, and prior strokes, who presents with hypotension and respiratory distress. The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, acute on chronic renal failure, hypernatremia, acidosis, atrial fibrillation with RVR, coagulopathy, CAD, anemia, and tongue twitching.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.8°F)
* Heart rate: 67 bpm (63-75 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 130/47 mmHg (71-131/56-83 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 13 inspirations per minute (12-23 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* SpO2: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.6-12.3 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 32.0-32.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 157-188 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 5.3 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 19 mg/dL
* Serum sodium: 155 mmol/L

   Assessment and Plan
   This 94M with CAD, dementia, afib, and prior strokes presents with
   hypotension and respiratory distress.
   1. Sepsis, pna
   Most likely pulmonary source, though consider also line infection
   (uncertain when PICC was placed). UTI also a consideration, though no
   bacteria on UA here. Given prior strokes at risk for aspiration.
   - continue empiric vancomycin, zosyn, and cipro for HAP coverage
   - Sputum growing GNR, urine growing enterococcus
   - remove PICC today
   - CVP goal of 10 with IV NS PRN
   - levophed to maintain map>65
   - check SVO2 goal >70
   - attempt to extubated today given patient requiring minimal amount of
   support on ventilator
   - Monitor ABG
   -Place NG tube
   .
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Patient was likely pre-renal with decreased PO intake, very likely to
   have developed ATN in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor urine output-has been good
   - renally dose meds
   - holding ACEI
   - urine lytes, eosinophils
   - renal recs appreciated, may need CVVH, at this point not indicated
   .
   3. Hypernatremia
   High sodium in the setting of poor PO intake, increased free H20 loss
   in the setting of fever. Estimated free water deficit ~4.6L
   - start D5W @ 125/hr to correct for water deficit and ongoing losses,
   changed overnight to D51/2 NS and then converted back to D5W.
   - follow Na q6hrs goal 0.5meq/hr correction
   - Hold tube feeds today in anticipation of extubation, will start d5W
   at 75 cc/hour until TF resumed
   .
   4. Acidosis
   Mixed disturbance; non-gap acidosis [**1-17**] fluid resuscitation and gap
   acidosis probably related to renal failure with additional contribution
   from mildly elevated lactate at admission
   -          hold off on further saline, will use LR if needs additional
   volume resuscitation
   -          Avoid changing vent to increase RR and decrease CO2 as
   previously mentioned
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Now in SR, RVR likely provoked by catecholaminergic state of sepsis
   - continue amiodarone drip x24hrs per cards recs-last dose 2 PM
   yesterday, transition to metoprolol not successful, will start PO
   amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - not on anticoagulation
   - can recheck TSH when over illness
   .
   6. Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 1.8 but per records not on anticoagulation. In setting
   of infection must consider DIC but this seems less likely. Nutritional
   deficiency may be more likely. Followup smear, FDP, D-dimer- no
   evidence of DIC
   - Trend INR, no need to give vitamin K at this time
   .
   7. CAD
   Patient's admission EKG with STD/TWI, most likely demand ischemia in
   setting of rapid rate. Tropn elevated but renal failure also
   complicates interpretation.
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes x2-elevated, but peaked
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 325
   .
   8. Anemia
   Hct 37 at admission was above recent baseline of ~33 likely reflecting
   hemoconcentration decrease to 32 on repeat today follows significant
   IVF resuscitation. No evidence of active bleeding
   - Follow Hct, coags, type and screen active
   .
   9. Tongue twitching-?Unmasking of old stroke in setting of infection.
   Consider also seizure.
   -currently on [**Last Name (LF) 5122**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] discontinue today as sodium resolved and
   monitor patient closely for signs of recurrence
   .
   10. Depression
   - Holding remeron given altered mental status
   .
   11. Glaucoma
   - Continue home eye drops
   FEN: Hold TF-restart when extubated with free water flushes,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 94M with CAD, dementia, afib, and prior strokes presents with
   hypotension and respiratory distress.
   1. Sepsis, pna
   Most likely pulmonary source, though consider also line infection
   (uncertain when PICC was placed). UTI also a consideration, though no
   bacteria on UA here. Given prior strokes at risk for aspiration.
   - continue empiric vancomycin, zosyn, and cipro for HAP coverage
   - Sputum growing GNR, urine growing enterococcus
   - remove PICC today
   - CVP goal of 10 with IV NS PRN
   - levophed to maintain map>65
   - check SVO2 goal >70
   - attempt to extubated today given patient requiring minimal amount of
   support on ventilator
   - Monitor ABG
   -Place NG tube
   .
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Patient was likely pre-renal with decreased PO intake, very likely to
   have developed ATN in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor urine output-has been good
   - renally dose meds
   - holding ACEI
   - urine lytes, eosinophils
   - renal recs appreciated, may need CVVH, at this point not indicated
   .
   3. Hypernatremia
   High sodium in the setting of poor PO intake, increased free H20 loss
   in the setting of fever. Estimated free water deficit ~4.6L
   - start D5W @ 125/hr to correct for water deficit and ongoing losses,
   changed overnight to D51/2 NS and then converted back to D5W.
   - follow Na q6hrs goal 0.5meq/hr correction
   - Hold tube feeds today in anticipation of extubation, will start d5W
   at 75 cc/hour until TF resumed
   .
   4. Acidosis
   Mixed disturbance; non-gap acidosis [**1-17**] fluid resuscitation and gap
   acidosis probably related to renal failure with additional contribution
   from mildly elevated lactate at admission
   -          hold off on further saline, will use LR if needs additional
   volume resuscitation
   -          Avoid changing vent to increase RR and decrease CO2 as
   previously mentioned
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Now in SR, RVR likely provoked by catecholaminergic state of sepsis
   - continue amiodarone drip x24hrs per cards recs-last dose 2 PM
   yesterday, transition to metoprolol not successful, will start PO
   amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - not on anticoagulation
   - can recheck TSH when over illness
   .
   6. Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 1.8 but per records not on anticoagulation. In setting
   of infection must consider DIC but this seems less likely. Nutritional
   deficiency may be more likely. Followup smear, FDP, D-dimer- no
   evidence of DIC
   - Trend INR, no need to give vitamin K at this time
   .
   7. CAD
   Patient's admission EKG with STD/TWI, most likely demand ischemia in
   setting of rapid rate. Tropn elevated but renal failure also
   complicates interpretation.
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes x2-elevated, but peaked
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 325
   .
   8. Anemia
   Hct 37 at admission was above recent baseline of ~33 likely reflecting
   hemoconcentration decrease to 32 on repeat today follows significant
   IVF resuscitation. No evidence of active bleeding
   - Follow Hct, coags, type and screen active
   .
   9. Tongue twitching-?Unmasking of old stroke in setting of infection.
   Consider also seizure.
   -currently on [**Last Name (LF) 5122**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] discontinue today as sodium resolved and
   monitor patient closely for signs of recurrence
   .
   10. Depression
   - Holding remeron given altered mental status
   .
   11. Glaucoma
   - Continue home eye drops
   FEN: Hold TF-restart when extubated with free water flushes,
   IVF-D5W-d/c when taking TF, replete lytes

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 94-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, dementia, atrial fibrillation, and prior strokes. He is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

The patient's 24-hour events include:

* Weaning off Levophed
* Development of atrial fibrillation, which was treated with metoprolol
* Hypotension and tachycardia, which responded to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support
* Fever, which was managed with antibiotics and antipyretics
* Development of hypernatremia, which was treated with D5W and sodium restriction
* Mixed acidosis, which was managed with fluid resuscitation and renal support

The patient's current medical conditions include:

* Sepsis, likely of pulmonary origin, with a possible line infection or urinary tract infection
* Acute on chronic renal failure, with a high risk of acute tubular necrosis
* Hypernatremia, which is likely due to poor oral intake and increased free water loss
* Acidosis, which is likely due to a mixed disturbance with a non-gap component
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is likely due to the patient's underlying cardiac disease and the catecholaminergic state of sepsis
* Coagulopathy, which is likely due to nutritional deficiency rather than disseminated intravascular coagulation
* Coronary artery disease, which is likely exacerbating the patient's cardiac condition
* Anemia, which is likely due to chronic disease and hemoconcentration
* Depression, which is being managed with antidepressant medication
* Glaucoma, which is being managed with home eye drops

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC count: 12.3-13.9 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 32.4-32.8%
* Platelet count: 188-170 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 4.4-3.9 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.35-0.39 ng/mL
* TCO2: 20 mmol/L
* Glucose: 178-138 mg/dL
* INR: 20.0-1.9
* PT/PTT/INR: 20.0-48.2-1.9
* CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 288-9-0.39
* Fibrinogen: 463 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.2 g/dL
* Ca++: 8.2 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.6 mg/dL

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Empiric antibiotics for suspected pulmonary infection
* Vasopressor support for hypotension
* Fluid resuscitation for acute tubular necrosis
* Renal support for acute kidney injury
* Sodium restriction for hypernatremia
* D5W infusion for correction of water deficit
* Antipyretics for fever
* Metoprolol for atrial fibrillation
* Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation
* Aspirin for coronary artery disease
* Remeron for depression
* Home eye drops for glaucoma

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: Glycemic control, enteral nutrition, and electrolyte management
* Lines: PICC line, multi-lumen line, and arterial line
* Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prophylaxis
* Comments: The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This 94M with CAD, dementia, afib, and prior strokes presents with
   hypotension and respiratory distress.
   1. Sepsis, pna
   Most likely pulmonary source, though consider also line infection
   (uncertain when PICC was placed). UTI also a consideration, though no
   bacteria on UA here. Given prior strokes at risk for aspiration.
   - continue empiric vancomycin, zosyn, and cipro for HAP coverage
   - culture blood, urine, sputum. need peripheral blood cx and PICC cx.
   check urine legionella ag. follow up outside micro.
   - clarify when PICC was placed
   - CVP goal of 10 with IV NS PRN
   - levophed to maintain map>65
   - check SVO2 goal >70
   - attempt to ventilate per ardsnet, but patient had wild swings in
   tidal volume.  Placed patient on PS and did much better
   - Monitor ABG
   .
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Patient was likely pre-renal with decreased PO intake, very likely to
   have developed ATN in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - holding ACEI
   - urine lytes, eosinophils
   - renal recs appreciated, may need CVVH, at this point not indicated
   .
   3. Hypernatremia
   High sodium in the setting of poor PO intake, increased free H20 loss
   in the setting of fever. Estimated free water deficit ~4.6L
   - start D5W @ 125/hr to correct for water deficit and ongoing losses,
   changed overnight to D51/2 NS and then converted back to D5W.
   - follow Na q4hrs goal 0.5meq/hr correction
   - Start TF today with free water flushes to attempt to correct sodium
   and decrease need for IV therapy
   .
   4. Acidosis
   Mixed disturbance; non-gap acidosis [**1-17**] fluid resuscitation and gap
   acidosis probably related to renal failure with additional contribution
   from mildly elevated lactate at admission
   -          hold off on further saline, will use LR if needs additional
   volume resuscitation
   -          Avoid changing vent to increase RR and decrease CO2 as
   previously mentioned
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Now in SR, RVR likely provoked by catecholaminergic state of sepsis
   - continue amiodarone drip x24hrs per cards recs-last dose 2 PM today,
   will consider transitioning back to metoprolol subsequently, if not on
   pressure support and able to tolerate
   - not on anticoagulation
   - can recheck TSH though interpretation may be clouded by current
   illness
   .
   6. Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 1.8 but per records not on anticoagulation. In setting
   of infection must consider DIC but this seems less likely. Nutritional
   deficiency may be more likely.
   - Trend INR, no need to give vitamin K at this time
   - Followup smear, FDP, D-dimer- no evidence of DIC

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 94M with CAD, dementia, afib, and prior strokes presents with
   hypotension and respiratory distress.
   1. Sepsis, pna
   Most likely pulmonary source, though consider also line infection
   (uncertain when PICC was placed). UTI also a consideration, though no
   bacteria on UA here. Given prior strokes at risk for aspiration.
   - continue empiric vancomycin, zosyn, and cipro for HAP coverage
   - culture blood, urine, sputum. need peripheral blood cx and PICC cx.
   check urine legionella ag. follow up outside micro.
   - clarify when PICC was placed
   - CVP goal of 10 with IV NS PRN
   - levophed to maintain map>65
   - check SVO2 goal >70
   - attempt to ventilate per ardsnet, but patient had wild swings in
   tidal volume.  Placed patient on PS and did much better
   - Monitor ABG
   .
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Patient was likely pre-renal with decreased PO intake, very likely to
   have developed ATN in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - holding ACEI
   - urine lytes, eosinophils
   - renal recs appreciated, may need CVVH, at this point not indicated
   .
   3. Hypernatremia
   High sodium in the setting of poor PO intake, increased free H20 loss
   in the setting of fever. Estimated free water deficit ~4.6L
   - start D5W @ 125/hr to correct for water deficit and ongoing losses,
   changed overnight to D51/2 NS and then converted back to D5W.
   - follow Na q4hrs goal 0.5meq/hr correction
   - Start TF today with free water flushes to attempt to correct sodium
   and decrease need for IV therapy
   .
   4. Acidosis
   Mixed disturbance; non-gap acidosis [**1-17**] fluid resuscitation and gap
   acidosis probably related to renal failure with additional contribution
   from mildly elevated lactate at admission
   -          hold off on further saline, will use LR if needs additional
   volume resuscitation
   -          Avoid changing vent to increase RR and decrease CO2 as
   previously mentioned
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Now in SR, RVR likely provoked by catecholaminergic state of sepsis
   - continue amiodarone drip x24hrs per cards recs-last dose 2 PM today,
   will consider transitioning back to metoprolol subsequently, if not on
   pressure support and able to tolerate
   - not on anticoagulation
   - can recheck TSH though interpretation may be clouded by current
   illness
   .
   6. Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 1.8 but per records not on anticoagulation. In setting
   of infection must consider DIC but this seems less likely. Nutritional
   deficiency may be more likely.
   - Trend INR, no need to give vitamin K at this time
   - Followup smear, FDP, D-dimer- no evidence of DIC
   .
   7. CAD
   Patient's admission EKG with STD/TWI, most likely demand ischemia in
   setting of rapid rate. Tropn elevated but renal failure also
   complicates interpretation.
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes x2-elevated, but peaked
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 325
   .
   8. Anemia
   Hct 37 at admission was above recent baseline of ~33 likely reflecting
   hemoconcentration decrease to 32 on repeat today follows significant
   IVF resuscitation. No evidence of active bleeding
   - Follow Hct, coags, type and screen active
   .
   9. Tongue twitching
   ?Unmasking of old stroke in setting of infection. Consider also
   seizure.
   - Per Neuro start Keppra and continue to monitor, will consider need
   for long term treatment given other co-morbidities and prognosis
   .
   10. Depression
   - Holding remeron given altered mental status
   .
   11. Glaucoma
   - Continue home eye drops

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 94-year-old male with a complex medical history, including coronary artery disease, dementia, atrial fibrillation, and prior strokes. He is currently in the ICU due to hypotension and respiratory distress.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 102.2°F (39°C)
* Heart rate: 112 bpm
* Blood pressure: 103/45 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient has a number of medical conditions, including:

* Sepsis, likely due to a pulmonary source, with a possibility of line infection or UTI
* Acute on chronic renal failure, with a high risk of developing acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
* Hypernatremia, with an estimated free water deficit of approximately 4.6 liters
* Acidosis, likely due to a mixed disturbance
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which has resolved
* Coagulopathy, with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR)
* Coronary artery disease, with elevated troponin levels
* Anemia, with a hematocrit of 32%
* Tongue twitching, which may be related to an old stroke or seizure
* Depression, with altered mental status
* Glaucoma, with a history of eye drops

The patient is receiving a number of medications, including:

* Fentanyl
* Metoprolol
* Vancomycin
* Zosyn
* Ciprofloxacin
* Pantoprazole
* Aspirin
* Keppra

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 12.3 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 32.4%
* Platelet count: 188 K/uL
* Creatinine: 4.4 mg/dL
* Troponin: 0.35 ng/mL
* Lactic acid: 2.0 mmol/L
* Albumin: 2.2 g/dL
* Calcium: 8.2 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 2.6 mg/dL

The patient's fluid status is concerning, with a high risk of fluid overload and electrolyte imbalance. The patient's acidosis and coagulopathy also require close monitoring and management.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for:

* Sepsis-related organ dysfunction
* Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
* Respiratory failure
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Stroke or seizure
* Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Infection-related complications, such as line infections or UTIs

Based on this information, I recommend the following:

* Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely
* Manage the patient's fluid status and electrolyte imbalance carefully
* Continue to provide supportive care, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed
* Consider the use of diuretics and vasopressors to manage the patient's blood pressure and fluid status
* Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including the use of cardiac enzymes and electrocardiograms
* Consider the use of anticoagulation therapy to prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism
* Monitor the patient's mental status and provide supportive care as needed
* Consider the use of a nasogastric tube for feeding and medication administration
* Monitor the patient's wound care and provide supportive care as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   This [**Age over 90 **]M with CAD, dementia, afib, and prior strokes presents with
   hypotension and respiratory distress.
   1. Hypotension/Sepsis: Currently under treatment for PNA with untyped
   GNR in sputum.  His blood pressure and heart rate remain labile,
   although they have been stable since an episode of hypotension/Afib
   overnight.  The cause/effect relationship between his blood pressure
   and afib is unclear.  Successfully extubated and satting well on room
   air.
   - Zosyn/Cipro for HAP coverage
   - Sputum growing GNR, urine growing enterococcus
   - CVP goal of 10 with IV NS PRN
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Patient was likely pre-renal with decreased PO intake, very likely to
   have developed ATN in the setting of hypotension. UOP and creatinine
   improving.
   - monitor urine output-has been good
   - renally dose meds
   - holding ACEI
   3. Hypernatremia
   High sodium in the setting of poor PO intake, increased free H20 loss
   in the setting of fever.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Na checks
   - Free water bolus with tube feed, Hold IVF
   4. Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Now in SR, RVR likely provoked by catecholaminergic state of sepsis
   - continue Amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - not on anticoagulation
   - can recheck TSH when over illness
   5. Acidosis: Improving
   Mixed disturbance; non-gap acidosis [**1-17**] fluid resuscitation and gap
   acidosis probably related to renal failure with additional contribution
   from mildly elevated lactate at admission
   -          hold off on further saline, will use LR if needs additional
   volume resuscitation
   -          Avoid changing vent to increase RR and decrease CO2 as
   previously mentioned
   6. Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 1.8 but per records not on anticoagulation. No evidence
   of DIC or hemolysis
   - Trend INR, no need to give vitamin K at this time
   7. CAD
   Patient's admission EKG with STD/TWI, most likely demand ischemia in
   setting of rapid rate. Tropn elevated but renal failure also
   complicates interpretation.
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes x2-elevated, but peaked
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 325
   8. Anemia: Hct 37 at admission was above recent baseline of ~33 likely
   reflecting hemoconcentration decrease to 32 on repeat today follows
   significant IVF resuscitation. No evidence of active bleeding
   - Follow Hct, coags, type and screen active
   9. Tongue twitching-?Unmasking of old stroke in setting of infection.
   Consider also seizure.
   -currently on [**Last Name (LF) 5122**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] discontinue today as sodium resolved and
   monitor patient closely for signs of recurrence
   10. Depression
   - Holding remeron given altered mental status
   11. Glaucoma
   - Continue home eye drops
   FEN: Hold TF-restart when extubated with free water flushes,
   IVF-D5W-d/c when taking TF, replete lytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of CAD, dementia, atrial fibrillation, and prior strokes, admitted to the ICU with hypotension and respiratory distress.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient is under treatment for pneumonia with untyped GNR in sputum, and his blood pressure and heart rate remain labile. The cause/effect relationship between his blood pressure and atrial fibrillation is unclear.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient was likely pre-renal with decreased PO intake, and may have developed acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of hypotension. His urine output and creatinine levels are improving.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels in the setting of poor PO intake and increased free water loss in the setting of fever.
4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR): The patient is now in sinus rhythm, and his RVR is likely provoked by the catecholaminergic state of sepsis.
5. Acidosis: The patient has a mixed disturbance, including non-gap acidosis due to fluid resuscitation and gap acidosis likely related to renal failure.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated at 1.8, but there is no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or hemolysis.
7. CAD: The patient's admission EKG shows STD/TWI, likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of rapid rate. His troponin levels are elevated, but peaked, and he is being monitored on telemetry.
8. Anemia: The patient's Hct is 37, which is above his recent baseline of ~33, likely due to hemoconcentration.
9. Tongue twitching: The patient's tongue twitching may be unmasking an old stroke in the setting of infection, or it could be a seizure.
10. Depression: The patient is being held on remeron due to altered mental status.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued hypotension and sepsis
* Worsening renal failure
* Hypernatremia and electrolyte imbalances
* Atrial fibrillation with RVR
* Acidosis and electrolyte imbalances
* Coagulopathy and bleeding
* CAD and ischemia
* Anemia and bleeding
* Tongue twitching and seizure
* Depression and altered mental status

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing treatment for pneumonia with untyped GNR in sputum
* Monitoring urine output and creatinine levels
* Managing hypernatremia and electrolyte imbalances
* Monitoring atrial fibrillation and RVR
* Managing acidosis and electrolyte imbalances
* Monitoring coagulopathy and bleeding
* Managing CAD and ischemia

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-inch tall, 59.1 kg individual admitted to the ICU with a history of coronary artery disease, chronic anemia, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation, renal failure, and hypernatremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure of 170/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 35%. The patient's neurological status is altered, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 12.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and creatinine levels. The patient's troponin-T level is elevated, indicating cardiac injury. The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypernatremia and hypokalemia.

The patient's medical history includes a history of cardiac arrest, coronary artery disease, chronic anemia, and aspiration pneumonia. The patient's family history is significant for cardiac disease.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and creatinine levels suggest the possibility of sepsis.
2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest the possibility of acute renal failure.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated sodium levels can lead to dehydration, seizures, and coma if left untreated.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke if left untreated.
5. Coronary artery disease: The patient's history of coronary artery disease increases the risk of cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, and cardiac failure.
6. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia increases the risk of respiratory failure, sepsis, and death.
7. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated troponin-T level and decreased platelet count suggest the possibility of coagulopathy, which can lead to bleeding and thrombotic complications.
8. Acidosis: The patient's mixed acidosis can lead to respiratory and cardiac failure if left untreated.
9. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status can lead to delirium, which can increase the risk of falls, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
10. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's history of impaired skin integrity can increase the risk of skin breakdown, infection, and sepsis.

The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   This [**Age over 90 **]M with CAD, dementia, afib, and prior strokes presents with
   hypotension and respiratory distress.
   1. Sepsis, pna
   Most likely pulmonary source, though consider also line infection
   (uncertain when PICC was placed). UTI also a consideration, though no
   bacteria on UA here. Given prior strokes at risk for aspiration.
   - continue empiric vancomycin, zosyn, and cipro for HAP coverage
   - Sputum growing GNR, urine growing enterococcus
   - remove PICC today
   - CVP goal of 10 with IV NS PRN
   - levophed to maintain map>65
   - check SVO2 goal >70
   - attempt to extubated today given patient requiring minimal amount of
   support on ventilator
   - Monitor ABG
   -Place NG tube
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Patient was likely pre-renal with decreased PO intake, very likely to
   have developed ATN in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor urine output-has been good
   - renally dose meds
   - holding ACEI
   - urine lytes, eosinophils
   - renal recs appreciated, may need CVVH, at this point not indicated
   3. Hypernatremia
   High sodium in the setting of poor PO intake, increased free H20 loss
   in the setting of fever. Estimated free water deficit ~4.6L
   - start D5W @ 125/hr to correct for water deficit and ongoing losses,
   changed overnight to D51/2 NS and then converted back to D5W.
   - follow Na q6hrs goal 0.5meq/hr correction
   - Hold tube feeds today in anticipation of extubation, will start d5W
   at 75 cc/hour until TF resumed
   4. Acidosis
   Mixed disturbance; non-gap acidosis [**1-17**] fluid resuscitation and gap
   acidosis probably related to renal failure with additional contribution
   from mildly elevated lactate at admission
   -          hold off on further saline, will use LR if needs additional
   volume resuscitation
   -          Avoid changing vent to increase RR and decrease CO2 as
   previously mentioned
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Now in SR, RVR likely provoked by catecholaminergic state of sepsis
   - continue amiodarone drip x24hrs per cards recs-last dose 2 PM
   yesterday, transition to metoprolol not successful, will start PO
   amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - not on anticoagulation
   - can recheck TSH when over illness
   6. Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 1.8 but per records not on anticoagulation. In setting
   of infection must consider DIC but this seems less likely. Nutritional
   deficiency may be more likely. Followup smear, FDP, D-dimer- no
   evidence of DIC
   - Trend INR, no need to give vitamin K at this time
   7. CAD
   Patient's admission EKG with STD/TWI, most likely demand ischemia in
   setting of rapid rate. Tropn elevated but renal failure also
   complicates interpretation.
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes x2-elevated, but peaked
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 325
   8. Anemia: Hct 37 at admission was above recent baseline of ~33 likely
   reflecting hemoconcentration decrease to 32 on repeat today follows
   significant IVF resuscitation. No evidence of active bleeding
   - Follow Hct, coags, type and screen active
   9. Tongue twitching-?Unmasking of old stroke in setting of infection.
   Consider also seizure.
   -currently on [**Last Name (LF) 5122**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] discontinue today as sodium resolved and
   monitor patient closely for signs of recurrence
   10. Depression
   - Holding remeron given altered mental status
   11. Glaucoma
   - Continue home eye drops
   FEN: Hold TF-restart when extubated with free water flushes,
   IVF-D5W-d/c when taking TF, replete lytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   (uncertain when PICC was placed). UTI also a consideration, though no
   bacteria on UA here. Given prior strokes at risk for aspiration.
   - continue empiric vancomycin, zosyn, and cipro for HAP coverage
   - Sputum growing GNR, urine growing enterococcus
   - remove PICC today
   - CVP goal of 10 with IV NS PRN
   - levophed to maintain map>65
   - check SVO2 goal >70
   - attempt to extubated today given patient requiring minimal amount of
   support on ventilator
   - Monitor ABG
   -Place NG tube
   2. Acute on chronic renal failure
   Patient was likely pre-renal with decreased PO intake, very likely to
   have developed ATN in the setting of hypotension
   - monitor urine output-has been good
   - renally dose meds
   - holding ACEI
   - urine lytes, eosinophils
   - renal recs appreciated, may need CVVH, at this point not indicated
   3. Hypernatremia
   High sodium in the setting of poor PO intake, increased free H20 loss
   in the setting of fever. Estimated free water deficit ~4.6L
   - start D5W @ 125/hr to correct for water deficit and ongoing losses,
   changed overnight to D51/2 NS and then converted back to D5W.
   - follow Na q6hrs goal 0.5meq/hr correction
   - Hold tube feeds today in anticipation of extubation, will start d5W
   at 75 cc/hour until TF resumed
   4. Acidosis
   Mixed disturbance; non-gap acidosis [**1-17**] fluid resuscitation and gap
   acidosis probably related to renal failure with additional contribution
   from mildly elevated lactate at admission
   -          hold off on further saline, will use LR if needs additional
   volume resuscitation
   -          Avoid changing vent to increase RR and decrease CO2 as
   previously mentioned
   5. Atrial fibrillation with RVR
   Now in SR, RVR likely provoked by catecholaminergic state of sepsis
   - continue amiodarone drip x24hrs per cards recs-last dose 2 PM
   yesterday, transition to metoprolol not successful, will start PO
   amiodarone 200 mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - not on anticoagulation
   - can recheck TSH when over illness
   6. Coagulopathy
   INR elevated at 1.8 but per records not on anticoagulation. In setting
   of infection must consider DIC but this seems less likely. Nutritional
   deficiency may be more likely. Followup smear, FDP, D-dimer- no
   evidence of DIC
   - Trend INR, no need to give vitamin K at this time
   7. CAD
   Patient's admission EKG with STD/TWI, most likely demand ischemia in
   setting of rapid rate. Tropn elevated but renal failure also
   complicates interpretation.
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes x2-elevated, but peaked
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 325
   8. Anemia: Hct 37 at admission was above recent baseline of ~33 likely
   reflecting hemoconcentration decrease to 32 on repeat today follows
   significant IVF resuscitation. No evidence of active bleeding
   - Follow Hct, coags, type and screen active
   9. Tongue twitching-?Unmasking of old stroke in setting of infection.
   Consider also seizure.
   -currently on [**Last Name (LF) 5122**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] discontinue today as sodium resolved and
   monitor patient closely for signs of recurrence
   10. Depression
   - Holding remeron given altered mental status
   11. Glaucoma
   - Continue home eye drops
   FEN: Hold TF-restart when extubated with free water flushes,
   IVF-D5W-d/c when taking TF, replete lytes

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient's condition remains critical, and multiple medical complications are present. The patient is at risk for:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a pulmonary source of infection, and there is a possibility of line infection or UTI. The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics, and the cultures are pending.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has decreased PO intake, and the creatinine level is elevated. The patient is at risk for developing ATN, and the urine output should be closely monitored.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level, and an estimated free water deficit of 4.6L. The patient is receiving D5W to correct for the water deficit and ongoing losses.
4. Acidosis: The patient has a mixed disturbance, with non-gap acidosis from fluid resuscitation and gap acidosis from renal failure. The patient's lactate level is mildly elevated, and the patient is at risk for further acidosis.
5. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR: The patient is now in sinus rhythm, and the RVR is likely due to the catecholaminergic state of sepsis. The patient is receiving amiodarone, and the dose will be increased.
6. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated, and the patient is at risk for DIC. However, the patient's coagulation studies are normal, and the patient is not receiving anticoagulation.
7. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, and the patient's EKG shows STD/TWI. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and the patient is at risk for further cardiac complications.
8. Anemia: The patient's Hct is 37, which is above the recent baseline. The patient's anemia is likely due to hemoconcentration from IVF resuscitation.
9. Tongue Twitching: The patient's tongue twitching may be due to an old stroke or seizure.
10. Depression: The patient is being held on remeron due to altered mental status.

The patient's medical treatment plan includes:

* Empiric antibiotics for HAP coverage
* Removal of the PICC line
* CVP goal of 10 with IV NS PRN
* Levophed to maintain MAP > 65
* Attempt to extubate the patient today
* Monitor ABG
* Place NG tube
* Renal dosing of medications
* Holding ACEI
* Monitoring urine output and electrolytes
* Correction of hypernatremia with D5W
* Avoiding further saline administration
* Continuing amiodarone drip for atrial fibrillation
* Monitoring coagulation studies and platelet count
* Holding remeron due to altered mental status

The patient's code status is full code, and the patient's disposition is unclear at this time."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old man with severe dementia, prior CVA, and AFib, who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, fever, and AF. He was treated for sepsis/PNA and intubated, but was extubated yesterday.

Current vital signs:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 70 bpm
* Blood pressure: 121/41 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 inspirations per minute
* SpO2: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery, PSV/SBT ventilation, and a FiO2 of 35%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.36, PaO2 of 286, and PaCO2 of 34 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 12.3 K/uL
* Platelet count: 188 K/uL
* Creatinine: 4.4 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.39 ng/mL
* TCO2: 19 mmol/L
* Glucose: 178 mg/dL

The patient's medical history and review of systems are unchanged from admission, except for the following:

* Anemia
* AFib
* Prior CVA
* Severe dementia

The patient's physical examination shows:

* General appearance: Thin
* Eyes/Conjunctiva: No PERRL
* Cardiovascular: Normal S1 and S2 heart sounds
* Peripheral vascular: Right radial pulse not assessed, Left radial pulse not assessed
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds present
* Neurologic: Responds to stimuli, movement not assessed, tone not assessed
* Skin: Not assessed

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: Much improved, likely recovering from aspiration PNA. Discontinue vancomycin and continue ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam pending further sensitivities on sputum.
* AF: Currently rate-controlled on amiodarone.
* Acute on chronic renal failure: Much improved with hydration.
* Hypernatremia: Much improved with D5W. Continue free water through total parenteral nutrition.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: Re-intubation or further deterioration in respiratory status.
* AF: Recurrence of AF or development of atrial flutter or fibrillation.
* Acute on chronic renal failure: Further deterioration in renal function or development of acute kidney injury.
* Hypernatremia: Continued hypernatremia or development of hyponatremia.
* Infection: Development of new infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or sepsis.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: Hemorrhage from the gastrointestinal tract.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: Development of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to detect any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent further deterioration in his condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 86-year-old man with severe dementia, prior CVA, and AFib, who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress, fever, and AF from a nursing home. He was intubated and extubated yesterday. Currently, he is on invasive ventilation, with a respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and is receiving oxygen therapy. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 121/41 mmHg. His laboratory results show anemia, hypernatremia, and acute on chronic renal failure, but these conditions are improving with treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure is likely recovering from aspiration pneumonia, and further sensitivities on sputum are pending.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to being on invasive ventilation, and prophylaxis measures are in place.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is improving with hydration, but AKI remains a concern.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is improving with D5W, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent recurrence.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern, and further treatment is necessary to prevent complications.
6. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is improving, but continued close monitoring is necessary to prevent recurrence.
7. AFib: The patient's AFib is currently rate-controlled on amiodarone, but further treatment may be necessary to prevent complications.
8. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to being immobile, and prophylaxis measures are in place.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Administer antibiotics as prescribed and continue to monitor for signs of sepsis.
3. Maintain the patient's respiratory support and continue to monitor for signs of respiratory failure.
4. Continue to treat the patient's hypernatremia with D5W and monitor for signs of recurrence.
5. Consider further treatment for the patient's AFib, such as cardioversion or antiarrhythmic medication.
6. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of DVT and take prophylactic measures as necessary.
7. Consider further testing, such as a head CT or MRI, to rule out other potential causes of the patient's respiratory failure."
