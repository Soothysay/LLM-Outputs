   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38 yo F with DMI, PVD s/p recent BKA presenting
   with diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure and
   NSTEMI.
   .
   #Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Resolving with no acidosis this morning and BS
   which are stabilizing.  Pt got home dose of glargine last night with
   HISS for correction.  Now off IV fluids and eating well.
   - continue to check FSBS q4-6 hours (qACHS)
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   -Goal glucose 150-200
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 now resolved, unclear etiology but probably stress
   response from DKA.
   .
   #Pancreatitis
 unclear etiology, pt has been vomiting
   - recheck amylase and lipase this AM
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - creatinine up to 4.2 on admission from baseline
   of [**2-3**].4, likely [**3-7**] prerenal etiology from dehydration.  Now resolved.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #Hyperkalemia - resolved
   .
   #Altered Mental Status
 most likely from severe DKA, appears to be
   improving.
   .
   #Elevated Troponin - likely demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   DKA and dehydration. MB index trending down, troponin elevation may be
   in the setting of renal failure.
   - getting ASA
   .
   #Anemia - HCT of 24 on admission appears to be close to recent values
   so unlikely acute bleeding.
   -monitor daily hct, outpatient workup
   .
   #Hypertension - currently borderline hypotensive
   -clonidine restarted yesterday for hypertension
   .
   # Depression
 per psych, may need inpatient psych once medically
   cleared.  Psych is following.
   - continue to provide emotional support
   #FEN
 diabetic diet, repleting lytes frequently (especially potassium)
   .
   #Prophylaxis - heparin sq, omeprazole, bowel reg if needed
   .
   #Code Status - presumed full
   .
   #HCP: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 765**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3387**] (father); mother is [**Name (NI) 3388**]

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  38 yo F with DMI c/b vascular ds, global
   systolic CHF with EF 30
s, recent BKA, and depression, admitted  from
   group home with DKA and altered mental status, also noted to have tox +
   cocaine, leukocytosis, LFT elevations and chemical pancreatitis.  Gap
   closed and BS controlled on glargine, RSSI, off insulin gtt.
   Transfused 1 U PRBCs for significant anemia with approp bump.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.4   BP 133/73  HR 80
s RR 10-15 with sat 99% on
   RA. + 1 L/24 hrs.  Awake and alert, easily tearful, + thrush, MMM, CTA,
   benign abd, RR, BKA site healing, no LE edema; Labs notable for WBC 8.7
   HCT 23.9 (20.3), Na 135, K 3.5 bicarb 21 cr 1.4, glucose 84, trop 1.02
   (up), A  and lfts pending; CXR--no new film
   Agree with plan to continue glargine and humalog. Tolerating
   POs. Fluids off.  MS improved.  ARF appears prerenal in setting of DKA,
   improved to baseline with hydration with good u/o. Continue to follow
   lytes at least [**Hospital1 7**]. Leukocytosis has resolved, likely stress response
   with no clear infectious source identified.  NSTEMI/trop leak is likely
   demand, + cocaine
trop trending down, continue asa, s/p 1 unit PRBCs
   given significant anemia with appropraite bump and now close to
   baseline.  Would continue to follow h/h and check anemia w/u.  Altered
   MS
[**First Name (Titles) 1418**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3412**] in setting of cocaine and DKA/toxic metabolic,
   head CT neg, and depression--now alert and oriented X 3.  Psych c/s
   appreciated.  Chemical pancreatitis
 remains asx and tolerating POs,
   trend a/l.  Check hep serologies and consider liver imaging (elevated
   ggt). D/c fem line and place peripherals. Stable for floor transfer.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  38 yo F with DMI c/b vascular ds, global
   systolic CHF with EF 30
s, recent BKA, and depression, admitted  from
   group home with DKA and altered mental status, also noted to have tox +
   cocaine, leukocytosis, LFT elevations and chemical pancreatitis.  Gap
   closed and BS controlled on glargine, RSSI, off insulin gtt.
   Transfused 1 U PRBCs for significant anemia with approp bump.
   Exam notable for Tm 98.4   BP 133/73  HR 80
s RR 10-15 with sat 99% on
   RA. + 1 L/24 hrs.  Awake and alert, easily tearful, + thrush, MMM, CTA,
   benign abd, RR, BKA site healing, no LE edema; Labs notable for WBC 8.7
   HCT 23.9 (20.3), Na 135, K 3.5 bicarb 21 cr 1.4, glucose 84, trop 1.02
   (up), A  and lfts pending; CXR--no new film
   Agree with plan to continue glargine and humalog. Tolerating
   POs. Fluids off.  MS improved.  ARF appears prerenal in setting of DKA,
   improved to baseline with hydration with good u/o. Continue to follow
   lytes at least [**Hospital1 7**]. Leukocytosis has resolved, likely stress response
   with no clear infectious source identified.  NSTEMI/trop leak is likely
   demand, + cocaine
trop trending down, continue asa, s/p 1 unit PRBCs
   given significant anemia with appropraite bump and now close to
   baseline.  Would continue to follow h/h and check anemia w/u.  Altered
   MS
[**First Name (Titles) 1418**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3412**] in setting of cocaine and DKA/toxic metabolic,
   head CT neg, and depression--now alert and oriented X 3.  Psych c/s
   appreciated.  Chemical pancreatitis
 remains asx and tolerating POs,
   trend a/l.  Check hep serologies and consider liver imaging (elevated
   ggt). D/c fem line and place peripherals. Stable for floor transfer.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

Summary:

The patient, a 38-year-old female with a history of depression, diabetes mellitus, and peripheral vascular disease, was admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She was treated with insulin, fluids, and antibiotics, and her condition has improved significantly. Her laboratory results show a resolving leukocytosis, normalizing blood sugar levels, and improving renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Benzodiazepine withdrawal: The patient was on Clonazepam at home and may experience withdrawal symptoms if not managed properly.
2. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and may require inpatient psychiatric care once medically cleared.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has chemical pancreatitis, which may progress to severe pancreatitis if not managed properly.
4. NSTEMI: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which may indicate demand ischemia, and may require further management with ASA.
5. Anemia: The patient has a significant anemia, which may require further transfusions and outpatient workup.
6. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels were elevated, which may require further management with potassium supplements.
7. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is borderline hypotensive, which may require further management with antihypertensive medications.
8. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, which may indicate liver dysfunction or injury.
9. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient may have nutritional deficiencies due to her illness, which may require further management with dietary supplements.
10. Infection: The patient may have an underlying infection, which may require further management with antibiotics.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and adjust insulin dosing as needed.
2. Manage the patient's benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms with tapering doses of Clonazepam.
3. Provide inpatient psychiatric care if necessary to manage the patient's depression.
4. Continue to manage the patient's pancreatitis with antibiotics and supportive care.
5. Monitor the patient's troponin levels and adjust ASA dosing as needed.
6. Transfuse additional blood products as needed to manage the patient's anemia.
7. Monitor the patient's potassium levels and adjust potassium supplements as needed.
8. Manage the patient's hypertension with antihypertensive medications.
9. Monitor the patient's liver enzymes and adjust liver function tests as needed.
10. Provide nutritional support with dietary supplements and monitor the patient's nutritional status.

Timeline:

* Day 1: Continue to monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and adjust insulin dosing as needed.
* Day 2-3: Manage the patient's benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms with tapering doses of Clonazepam.
* Day 4-5: Provide inpatient psychiatric care if necessary to manage the patient's depression.
* Day 6-7: Continue to manage the patient's pancreatitis with antibiotics and supportive care.
* Day 8-9: Monitor the patient's troponin levels and adjust ASA dosing as needed.
* Day 10-14: Transfuse additional blood products as needed to manage the patient's anemia.
* Day 15-21: Monitor the patient's potassium levels and adjust potassium supplements as needed.
* Day 22-28: Manage the patient's hypertension with antihypertensive medications.
* Day 29-35: Monitor the patient's liver enzymes and adjust liver function tests as needed.
* Day 36-42: Provide nutritional support with dietary supplements and monitor the patient's nutritional status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38 yo F with DMI, PVD s/p recent BKA presenting
   with diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure and
   NSTEMI.
   .
   #Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Resolving with no acidosis this morning and BS
   which are stabilizing.  Pt got home dose of glargine last night with
   HISS for correction.  Now off IV fluids and eating well.
   - continue to check FSBS q4-6 hours (qACHS)
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   -Goal glucose 150-200
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 now resolved, unclear etiology but probably stress
   response from DKA.
   .
   #Pancreatitis
 unclear etiology, pt has been vomiting
   - recheck amylase and lipase this AM
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - creatinine up to 4.2 on admission from baseline
   of [**2-3**].4, likely [**3-7**] prerenal etiology from dehydration.  Now resolved.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #Hyperkalemia - resolved
   .
   #Altered Mental Status
 most likely from severe DKA, appears to be
   improving.
   .
   #Elevated Troponin - likely demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   DKA and dehydration. MB index trending down, troponin elevation may be
   in the setting of renal failure.
   - getting ASA
   .
   #Anemia - HCT of 24 on admission appears to be close to recent values
   so unlikely acute bleeding.
   -monitor daily hct, outpatient workup
   .
   #Hypertension - currently borderline hypotensive
   -clonidine restarted yesterday for hypertension
   .
   # Depression
 per psych, may need inpatient psych once medically
   cleared.  Psych is following.
   - continue to provide emotional support
   #FEN
 diabetic diet, repleting lytes frequently (especially potassium)
   .
   #Prophylaxis - heparin sq, omeprazole, bowel reg if needed

Summary:

The patient, a 38-year-old female, is a diabetic with a history of depression, presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and NSTEMI. She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management. Her condition has been improving, with resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, and acute renal failure. She has been off IV fluids and is eating well. Her mental status has also improved, and she is no longer experiencing altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Benzodiazepine withdrawal: The patient was on Clonazepam at home and may be experiencing withdrawal symptoms, which could lead to seizures, anxiety, and insomnia.
2. Pancreatitis: Although the patient's pancreatitis has resolved, there is still a risk of recurrence, especially if she continues to vomit.
3. Acute Renal Failure: Although the patient's creatinine levels have returned to normal, there is still a risk of acute kidney injury, especially if she experiences dehydration or other complications.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels were elevated, which could lead to cardiac arrhythmias and other complications if not monitored and managed properly.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still borderline hypotensive, which could lead to complications if not managed properly.
6. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and may require inpatient psych treatment once medically cleared.
7. Anemia: The patient's HCT is still slightly low, which could lead to complications if not monitored and managed properly.
8. Skin breakdown: The patient has a small area of skin breakdown on her left stump, which could lead to infection and other complications if not managed properly.
9. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is still being monitored, and there is a risk of respiratory complications if not managed properly.

Overall, the patient's condition is improving, but she still requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38 yo F with DMI, PVD s/p recent BKA presenting
   with diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure and
   NSTEMI.
   .
   #Diabetic Ketoacidosis: unclear cause for DKA however pancreatitis is
   most likely possibility at this time given significantly elevated
   amylase and lipase.  Other source of infection also possible given
   significantly elevated WBC.  Urine positive for cocaine which could
   also be contributing.
   -continue insulin gtt, monitor glucose Q1-2 hours, with goal of
   decreasing glucose by 100 every 4 hours
   -Goal glucose 150-200
   -will add D5 to IVF once serum glucose reaches 200
   -monitor K q2 hours, add KCL to IVF once K <5.3
   -check ABG to evaluate pH, may need NaHCO3 pH <7
   -change over to 1/2 NS once hyponatremia resolves to avoid non-gap
   acidosis
   -start SQ insulin once anion gap closes and glucose <200, then stop IV
   insulin gtt
   -treat underlying trigger
   .
   #Leukocytosis - concerning for possible infection although no obvious
   source at this time, patient is currently poor hisotrian.  CXR without
   infiltrate, consider repeating in AM once hydrated.  Urine without
   obvious infection.  Other possible cause is pancreatitis given elevated
   [**Doctor First Name **]/lip.
   -keep NPO, monitor [**Doctor First Name **]/lip; hold off on CT for now
   -f/u urine cx
   -f/u blood cx
   -send stool cx for C.diff if stooling
   -d/c antibiotics for now as most likely cause is pancreatitis
   .
   #Pancreatitis - possible cause for DKA
   -monitor amylase/lipase
   -NPO
   -monitor/treat associated symptoms ie. pain/nausea
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - creatinine up to 4.2 on admission from baseline
   of [**2-3**].4, likely [**3-7**] prerenal etiology from dehdration.  Creatine
   improving with hydration.
   -continue with IVF
   -trend creatinine
   -renally dose all medications
   .
   #Hyperkalemia - got IV calcium gluconate, Insulin in the ED, with
   potassium down to 5.2 prior to arrival on the floor.
   -Will monitor labs q1-2 hour
   -add 20-40mEQ KCL to NS IV once K <5.3.
   .
   #Altered Mental Status -> unclear [**Name2 (NI) 3360**], most likely due to severe
   DKA and metabolic derangements.  Tox screen also positive for cocaine
   which could be contributing.
   -monitor mental status
   -talk with family about baseline
   .
   #Elevated Alk Phos -> appears to be chronic of unclear etiology with
   elevated GGT as well.  Had abdominal ultrasound of liver in [**8-11**] which
   was unrevealing.
   -curbside liver service re: ? further imaging
   -repeat GGT with AM labs
   .
   #Elevated Troponin - likely demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   DKA and dehdration, although given h/o DM1 and vascular disease as well
   as recent cocaine use, ACS is possible.
   -trend CE's x 3 at least
   -follow serial EKG's
   -continue ASA
   -holding BB for now as her BP is borderline, will resume metoprolol
   when more stable
   -consider cardiology consultation in the am if enzymes still trending
   up.
   -hold statin for now given concern for acute infection/pancreatitis
   .
   #Anemia - HCT of 24 on admission appears to be close to recent values
   so unlikely acute bleeding.
   -monitor daily hct
   -iron studies, b12, folate
   .
   #Hypertension - currently borderline hypotensive
   -hold clonidine for now, resume once BP more stable to aviod rebound
   hypertension
   #FEN - NPO for now until mental status improves, replete lytes as
   above, IVF as above
   .
   #Prophylaxis - heparin sq, omeprazole, bowel reg if needed
   .
   #Code Status - presumed full

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38 yo F with DMI, PVD s/p recent BKA presenting
   with diabetic ketoacidosis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure and
   NSTEMI.
   .
   #Diabetic Ketoacidosis: unclear cause for DKA however pancreatitis is
   most likely possibility at this time given significantly elevated
   amylase and lipase.  Other source of infection also possible given
   significantly elevated WBC.  Urine positive for cocaine which could
   also be contributing.
   -continue insulin gtt, monitor glucose Q1-2 hours, with goal of
   decreasing glucose by 100 every 4 hours
   -Goal glucose 150-200
   -will add D5 to IVF once serum glucose reaches 200
   -monitor K q2 hours, add KCL to IVF once K <5.3
   -check ABG to evaluate pH, may need NaHCO3 pH <7
   -change over to 1/2 NS once hyponatremia resolves to avoid non-gap
   acidosis
   -start SQ insulin once anion gap closes and glucose <200, then stop IV
   insulin gtt
   -treat underlying trigger
   .
   #Leukocytosis - concerning for possible infection although no obvious
   source at this time, patient is currently poor hisotrian.  CXR without
   infiltrate, consider repeating in AM once hydrated.  Urine without
   obvious infection.  Other possible cause is pancreatitis given elevated
   [**Doctor First Name **]/lip.
   -keep NPO, monitor [**Doctor First Name **]/lip; hold off on CT for now
   -f/u urine cx
   -f/u blood cx
   -send stool cx for C.diff if stooling
   -d/c antibiotics for now as most likely cause is pancreatitis
   .
   #Pancreatitis - possible cause for DKA
   -monitor amylase/lipase
   -NPO
   -monitor/treat associated symptoms ie. pain/nausea
   .
   #Acute Renal Failure - creatinine up to 4.2 on admission from baseline
   of [**2-3**].4, likely [**3-7**] prerenal etiology from dehdration.  Creatine
   improving with hydration.
   -continue with IVF
   -trend creatinine
   -renally dose all medications
   .
   #Hyperkalemia - got IV calcium gluconate, Insulin in the ED, with
   potassium down to 5.2 prior to arrival on the floor.
   -Will monitor labs q1-2 hour
   -add 20-40mEQ KCL to NS IV once K <5.3.
   .
   #Altered Mental Status -> unclear [**Name2 (NI) 3360**], most likely due to severe
   DKA and metabolic derangements.  Tox screen also positive for cocaine
   which could be contributing.
   -monitor mental status
   -talk with family about baseline
   .
   #Elevated Alk Phos -> appears to be chronic of unclear etiology with
   elevated GGT as well.  Had abdominal ultrasound of liver in [**8-11**] which
   was unrevealing.
   -curbside liver service re: ? further imaging
   -repeat GGT with AM labs
   .
   #Elevated Troponin - likely demand ischemia in the setting of severe
   DKA and dehdration, although given h/o DM1 and vascular disease as well
   as recent cocaine use, ACS is possible.
   -trend CE's x 3 at least
   -follow serial EKG's
   -continue ASA
   -holding BB for now as her BP is borderline, will resume metoprolol
   when more stable
   -consider cardiology consultation in the am if enzymes still trending
   up.
   -hold statin for now given concern for acute infection/pancreatitis
   .
   #Anemia - HCT of 24 on admission appears to be close to recent values
   so unlikely acute bleeding.
   -monitor daily hct
   -iron studies, b12, folate
   .
   #Hypertension - currently borderline hypotensive
   -hold clonidine for now, resume once BP more stable to aviod rebound
   hypertension
   #FEN - NPO for now until mental status improves, replete lytes as
   above, IVF as above
   .
   #Prophylaxis - heparin sq, omeprazole, bowel reg if needed
   .
   #Code Status - presumed full
   .
   #HCP: [**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 765**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3387**] (father); mother is [**Name (NI) 3388**]

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's glucose levels are still elevated, and the doctor is monitoring it closely. If not managed properly, DKA can lead to severe complications such as cerebral edema, cardiac arrhythmias, and even death.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's amylase and lipase levels are still elevated, indicating ongoing pancreatitis. If not treated promptly, pancreatitis can lead to severe complications such as necrotizing pancreatitis, sepsis, and multi-organ failure.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are still elevated, indicating ongoing acute renal failure. If not managed properly, acute renal failure can lead to severe complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disorders, and even death.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are still elevated, indicating ongoing hyperkalemia. If not managed properly, hyperkalemia can lead to severe complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and even death.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to severe DKA and metabolic derangements. If not managed properly, altered mental status can lead to severe complications such as respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and even death.
6. Elevated Troponin: The patient's elevated troponin levels indicate ongoing cardiac injury. If not managed properly, cardiac injury can lead to severe complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, and even death.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely due to infection or pancreatitis. If not managed properly, leukocytosis can lead to severe complications such as sepsis, multi-organ failure, and even death.

The doctor's plan includes monitoring the patient's glucose levels closely, managing the patient's electrolyte imbalances, and treating the underlying causes of the patient's complications. The patient will also receive prophylactic antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent further complications."
