   Chief Complaint: Respiratory failure, s/p colectomy
   24 Hour Events:
   RSBI in 190s yesterday in the evening,  therefore a decision was made
   to delay extubation until this morning.   The patient was kept
   moderately acedemic pH 7.2-7.35 to preserve respiratory drive in this
   chronically retaining patient with restrictive lung physiology.  Tmax
   of 100.0F overnight, but is afebrile this morning.  The patient
   complains of moderate pain at incision site this AM.  She continues to
   be alert and responsive, able to answer all questions and follow
   commands.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of restrictive lung disease from kyphoscoliosis, vocal cord paralysis, and chronic CO2 retention. She underwent a colectomy and is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, and blood pressure of 105/59 mmHg. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, with a RSBI of 187 and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 413.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated WBC count of 19.1 K/uL, likely due to post-operative stress. Her Hct has decreased to 31.4% from 33.6% pre-operatively. Her platelet count is 372 K/uL, and her creatinine is 0.4 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic restrictive lung disease and history of CO2 retention make her prone to respiratory failure. Delayed extubation may increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and decreased Hct may indicate an underlying infection. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and decreased Hct may increase the risk of bleeding. Monitoring of Hct and transfusion as needed are crucial.
4. DVT: The patient is at risk of developing DVT due to her immobility and history of pulmonary embolism. Prophylactic measures such as heparin and pneumatic compression devices should be continued.
5. VAP: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of VAP. Implementing a VAP bundle and monitoring for signs of infection are essential.
6. AS: The patient's mild AS and euvolemia make her prone to fluid shifts and decreased cardiac output. Monitoring of I&O and fluid balance is crucial.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated WBC count may indicate an underlying infection or post-operative stress. Monitoring of WBC counts and trending are necessary.

In summary, the patient is at risk of developing various medical complications, including respiratory failure, sepsis, bleeding, DVT, VAP, AS, and leukocytosis. Close monitoring and implementation of preventive measures are crucial to prevent or manage these complications."

   24 Hour Events:
   80-year-old patient who would never had a colonoscopy.  She developed
   abdominal pain, was evaluated by CT scan, which showed a large mass in
   the right colon.  She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed a large
   mass in the ascending colon that was biopsy positive for
   well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with mucinous features.  Her CT scan
   obtained in the setting of abdominal pain shows no evidence of
   metastatic disease.
   .
   Patient underwent an elective colectomy.  She underwent open right
   colectomy for colon CA. Her EBL was 35cc. Patient recieved 2L LR. She
   received 0.8mg hydromorphone. Sleepy after extubation, given naloxone,
   RR okay but not ventilating well. Sinus tach to 160, given diltiazem
   10mg IV, down to 90, then another 10mg for HR 120. Remained drowsy on
   FM. Changed to nasal cannula, desatted to 80s, intubated. On SIMV, gas
   7.14/92/128. Not sedated.  Patient was transfered to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further
   care.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman who underwent an elective colectomy for colon cancer with no evidence of metastatic disease. She developed respiratory failure requiring intubation and is currently on SIMV ventilation. Her past medical history is significant for scoliosis, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, hyperthyroidism, paralyzed vocal cord, and a family history of abdominal cancer. She is currently being treated with pantoprazole and heparin sodium. Her current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.0°F, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 105/59 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, with a RSBI of 187 and a requirement for intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's temperature of 100.0°F and WBC count of 19.1 K/uL suggest the possibility of sepsis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's heart rate of 104 bpm and blood pressure of 105/59 mmHg may indicate cardiac instability.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of colon cancer and recent surgery make her susceptible to gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding, perforation, or obstruction.
5. Infection: The patient's paralyzed vocal cord and history of squamous cell cancers on her forehead increase her risk of infection.
6. DVT: The patient's history of hypercholesterolemia and recent surgery increase her risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's history of hyperthyroidism and recent surgery increase her risk of developing stress ulcers.
8. Malnutrition: The patient's recent surgery and potential for prolonged hospitalization increase her risk of malnutrition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as necessary.
2. Maintain a high index of suspicion for sepsis and cardiac complications, and initiate appropriate treatment if necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and address any complications promptly.
4. Implement measures to prevent infection, such as maintaining good hand hygiene and using personal protective equipment.
5. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation to reduce the risk of DVT.
6. Monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust her glycemic control as necessary.
7. Consider providing nutritional support to prevent malnutrition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman who underwent an elective colectomy for colon cancer. She was intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. Her medical history is significant for scoliosis, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, hyperthyroidism, paralyzed vocal cord, and squamous cell cancers on her forehead. She has no known family history of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 97%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's heart rate is 104 beats per minute, and her blood pressure is 105/59 mmHg.
* Neurological: The patient is intubated and has a paralyzed vocal cord.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of colon cancer and underwent a colectomy.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory disease and recent surgery may increase her risk of respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation may increase her risk of developing pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: The patient's chronic medical conditions and recent surgery may increase her risk of developing sepsis.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of scoliosis and recent surgery may increase her risk of developing DVT.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of scoliosis and recent surgery may increase her risk of developing pulmonary embolism.
6. Wound infection: The patient's recent surgery may increase her risk of developing a wound infection.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's recent surgery and chronic medical conditions may increase her risk of developing nutritional deficiencies.
8. Medication-related complications: The patient's medications, such as narcotics and sedatives, may increase her risk of developing medication-related complications.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of hypercholesterolemia and recent surgery may increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications.
10. Neurological complications: The patient's paralyzed vocal cord and recent surgery may increase her risk of developing neurological complications.

Based on the patient's current condition and medical history, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old male with a history of right open hemi-colectomy and kyphosis who was re-intubated in the PACU with hypercarbia in the setting of underlying restrictive ventilatory deficit and narcotic use likely leading to relative hypoventilation.

The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, with a recent improvement in his tolerance for spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). He is experiencing some increased abdominal pain, but is more awake, alert, and interactive this morning.

The patient has a history of penicillin allergy, and is receiving infusions of pantoprazole and heparin sodium. He is also receiving other medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and oncology treatment.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, and blood pressure of 111/51 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 97% on a FiO2 of 30%.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, and a midline surgical incision with dressing. He has trace edema in both lower extremities, and his extremities are warm and without cyanosis or clubbing.

The patient's laboratory results are significant for elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine, consistent with acute kidney injury. His hemoglobin and hematocrit are within normal limits, but his platelet count is slightly elevated. His magnesium level is low, and his potassium level is slightly elevated.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

* Respiratory failure: Held sedatives overnight, and the patient is tolerating SBT. He will be moved to an extubation trial, and will receive nebulizer treatment as needed. BiPAP will be considered as a backup if extubation is unsuccessful.
* Colon cancer: The patient received cipro and flagyl in the OR, and will require additional antibiotics. He has a PCN allergy, and will require further discussion with the oncologist regarding antibiotic treatment.
* Renal function: The patient is oliguric, but is improving with IV fluid repletion. His BUN and creatinine levels will be closely monitored, and he may require IV fluid boluses if his urine output remains marginal.
* Fluids: The patient is hypovolemic, but is improving. He will require close monitoring of his I/O, and may benefit from IV fluid boluses.
* Anemia: The patient has evidence of hemoconcentration post-op, and his Hct is now back to pre-op levels. He will be monitored for any changes in his Hct.
* Elevated WBC: The patient's elevated WBC count is likely stress-related, but there is concern for possible evolving infection. No focal signs are currently present, and the patient will be monitored for any changes in his WBC count.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient will continue to receive levothyroxine, and his dose will be adjusted to IV (fraction of home dose).
* Aortic stenosis: The patient has aortic stenosis, but no treatment is currently indicated. He will be monitored for any changes in his cardiac status.

The patient is critically ill and will require close monitoring and management in the ICU."

   #1, with respiratory failure post-operatively.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: History of vocal cord dysfunction and
   kyphosis.   Appears to have chronic retainer with bicarb.  Respiratory
   failure likely precipitated by the sedation in this chonically
   retaining patient with restrctive physiology.
   -SBT this morning.  Will attempt extubation this AM if the patient
   tolerates.  RSBI may be falsely elevated in this elderly patient with
   restrictive anatomy.  The patient appears much more alert and
   responsive this AN, making successful extubation more likely.  Will
   evaluate ABG on SBT.
   - Fentanyl 25-50 mcg bolus for pain control for now; will try to
   minimize narcotics use in this patient
   -Continue Bupivacaine via abd. catheter fort 72 hours

   appears euvolemic on exam, with adequate urinary output.  Hct stable
   compared to pre-op values.  Will be careful with IVF given AS, fluid
   shifts post-operatively.
   - Goal I&O even today given euvolemia. LR as needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old lady with restrictive lung disease due to kyphoscoliosis, history of CO2 retention, and R-sided vocal cord paralysis, who underwent a colectomy and is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure post-operatively. She was extubated but required reintubation due to desaturations and upper airway adventitious respiratory sounds. She is currently receiving non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and oxygen therapy. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 110/57 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Her laboratory results show mild anemia, leukocytosis, and normal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of restrictive lung disease and vocal cord paralysis increases her risk of respiratory failure. The use of NIPPV and oxygen therapy may help improve her respiratory status, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent further desaturations.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of infection, and her history of colon cancer increases her risk of post-operative complications. Close monitoring of her laboratory results and clinical status is necessary to detect any signs of infection.
3. Anemia: The patient's mild anemia may be related to her pre-operative anemia, and close monitoring of her hemoglobin levels is necessary to detect any further declines.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's euvolemia and adequate urinary output suggest that she is not at risk of fluid overload, but close monitoring of her fluid status is necessary to prevent fluid shifts post-operatively.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of colon cancer and immobilization during her stay in the ICU increase her risk of DVT. Prophylaxis with heparin and pneumatic compression devices is necessary to prevent DVT.
6. Stress Ulcer: The patient's history of colon cancer and post-operative status increase her risk of stress ulcer. Prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors is necessary to prevent stress ulcer.
7. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's use of NIPPV and oxygen therapy increases her risk of VAP. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and laboratory results is necessary to detect any signs of VAP.

Plan:

1. Continue NIPPV and oxygen therapy to improve the patient's respiratory status.
2. Monitor the patient's laboratory results and clinical status closely to detect any signs of infection, anemia, or fluid overload.
3. Continue prophylaxis with heparin and pneumatic compression devices to prevent DVT.
4. Continue prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors to prevent stress ulcer.
5. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and laboratory results closely to detect any signs of VAP.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 y/o lady with restrictive lung disease from kyphoscoliosis, history
   of CO2 retention, R sided vocal cord paralysis, now s/p colectomy, POD
   #1, with respiratory failure post-operatively.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: History of vocal cord dysfunction and
   kyphosis.   Appears to have chronic retainer with bicarb.  Respiratory
   failure likely precipitated by the sedation in this chonically
   retaining patient with restrctive physiology.
   -SBT this morning.  Will attempt extubation this AM if the patient
   tolerates.  RSBI may be falsely elevated in this elderly patient with
   restrictive anatomy.  The patient appears much more alert and
   responsive this AN, making successful extubation more likely.  Will
   evaluate ABG on SBT.
   - Fentanyl 25-50 mcg bolus for pain control for now; will try to
   minimize narcotics use in this patient
   -Continue Bupivacaine via abd. catheter fort 72 hours
   .
   # S/p right Colectomy for colon CA:
   - appreciate surgery recs, NPO for now
   - Pain control as above
   - will hold ASA for now
   .
   # AS:  Mild AS on clinical exam and TTE one year ago.  The patient
   appears euvolemic on exam, with adequate urinary output.  Hct stable
   compared to pre-op values.  Will be careful with IVF given AS, fluid
   shifts post-operatively.
   - Goal I&O even today given euvolemia. LR as needed.
   .
   #Anemia
 Hct slighly declined this AM to 31.4, compared to pre-op
   33.6.
   -Monitor Hct [**Hospital1 **] and transfuse for goal of Hct < 26 or signs of active
   bleeding\
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 WBC increased to 19.1 this AM from pre-op 13.0, likely
   in the setting of post-op stress.  The patient is afebrile at this
   time, so will hold off on antibiotics for now and will trend WBC
   counts.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with restrictive lung disease from kyphoscoliosis, history of CO2 retention, R-sided vocal cord paralysis, and recently underwent colectomy for colon CA. She was intubated due to respiratory failure post-operatively. The patient's RSBI was initially elevated at 79, but decreased after fentanyl bolus and extubation. She was re-intubated due to desatting and apnea on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 110/57 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Her respiratory support is nasal cannula with CPAP/PSV.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of vocal cord dysfunction and kyphosis makes her prone to respiratory failure. The sedation used during the procedure may have exacerbated this condition.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory support and the presence of upper airway adventitious respiratory sounds increase the risk of pneumonia.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and fever may indicate sepsis.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased slightly, and she may require transfusion to maintain a target hemoglobin level.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobility and the use of prophylactic heparin.
6. Stress Ulcer: The patient's recent surgery and prolonged use of sedation increase the risk of stress ulcer.
7. Vascular Access Complications: The patient's lines and catheters may be at risk for complications such as infection or dislodgement.
8. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of mild aortic stenosis and her current cardiac status may increase the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

Plan:

1. Continue respiratory support with nasal cannula and CPAP/PSV.
2. Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust respiratory support as needed.
3. Maintain pain control with fentanyl and continue to minimize narcotics use.
4. Continue prophylactic antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.
5. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin level and transfuse as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's lines and catheters for complications and replace as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's overall condition and adjust therapy as needed to prevent complications."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was successfully extubated yesterday.  The patient had
   transient desaturation episodes into 80s during sleep last  night.  ABG
   during the episode was 7.26/73/74 on face tent/nasal cannula.  The
   patient was started non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, but was
   noted to have brief periods of apnea on NIPPV with repeat ABG
   7.27/70/139.  It was believed to be secondary to decreased respiratory
   drive due to increased oxygenation, prompting decrease of FIO2 to 30%.
   NIPPV did not seem to provide any additional benefit, pt. appeared more
   confused, ABG stable at 7.27/71/93.   NIPPV was subsequently
   discontinued. This morning, the patient is satting well on 4L NC.  She
   is A+Ox3, responds appropriately to all questions, but appears somewhat
   more somnolent
   This morning the patient is without any specific complaints, denies
   abdominal pain, shortness of breath.  Notes mild back pain improved
   with positioning.  Pain well controlled. The patient is on Morphine
   0.5-1 mg Q4H:PRN, but has not required any doses since yesterday.  No
   flatus as of this morning.  Lopressor held this AM due to SBP in 90s.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 y/o lady with restrictive lung disease from kyphoscoliosis, history
   of CO2 retention, R sided vocal cord paralysis, now s/p colectomy, POD
   #1, with respiratory failure post-operatively.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: History of vocal cord dysfunction and
   kyphosis.   Appears to have chronic retainer with bicarb.  Successfully
   extubated yesterday, now satting well on NC.  Somnolence may be
   secondary to hypercarbia, however this patient is a chronic retainer
   with pCO2 close to baseline.
   - Repeat ABG to assess CO2 status.
   -Continue low dose Morphine PRN for pain control; minimize due to high
   risk of delirium.
   -Continue Bupivacaine via abd. catheter fort 72 hours
   .
   # S/p right Colectomy for colon CA:
   - Continue pain control as above
   - No antibiotics for now unless febrile or signs of infection
   - Follow surgery recs
   - will hold ASA for now
   - NPO for now
   -OOB in chair; PT consult
   .
   # AS:  Mild AS on clinical exam and TTE one year ago.  The patient
   appears euvolemic on exam, with adequate urinary output.  Hct continues
   to be stable, no signs of active bleed.  Will be careful with IVF given
   AS, fluid shifts post-operatively.
   - Goal I&O even today given euvolemia.
   -LR@50 cc/hr currently; will adjust as needed to achieve above goal.
   #Anemia
 Hct stable with no signs of active bleed
   -Monitor Hct daily and transfuse for goal of Hct < 26 or signs of
   active bleeding.
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 WBC declined today to 15.2 from 19.1 yesterday.  The
   patient is afebrile at this time, so will hold off on antibiotics for
   now and will trend WBC counts.
   FEN: NPO for now/ replete lytes PRN/ IVF as above
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx with sc heparin [**Hospital1 **] and pneumoboots
   -Pain management with Morphine as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   extubated yesterday, now satting well on NC.  Somnolence may be
   secondary to hypercarbia, however this patient is a chronic retainer
   with pCO2 close to baseline.
   - Repeat ABG to assess CO2 status.
   -Continue low dose Morphine PRN for pain control; minimize due to high
   risk of delirium.
   -Continue Bupivacaine via abd. catheter fort 72 hours

Summary:

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with restrictive lung disease due to kyphoscoliosis, history of CO2 retention, and R-sided vocal cord paralysis, who underwent a colectomy and is currently in the ICU. She was successfully extubated yesterday but experienced transient desaturation episodes during sleep, which were managed with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). However, NIPPV was discontinued due to brief periods of apnea and decreased respiratory drive. She is currently on nasal cannula oxygen at 4L and appears somnolent.

The patient is on various medications, including morphine for pain control, and has a stable hemodynamic profile. Her laboratory results show mild anemia, leukocytosis, and normal electrolyte levels. Her CXR is difficult to interpret due to kyphoscoliosis, but shows no acute interval changes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of CO2 retention and vocal cord dysfunction puts her at risk for respiratory failure. Repeat ABG and continue to monitor her respiratory status.
2. Delirium: The patient's use of morphine for pain control increases her risk of delirium. Continue to monitor her mental status and adjust her pain management plan as needed.
3. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and recent surgery increase her risk of infection. Monitor her temperature and white blood cell count, and consider antibiotic therapy if she develops signs of infection.
4. Bleeding: The patient's anemia and history of bleeding complications increase her risk of bleeding. Monitor her hemoglobin levels and transfuse as needed.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobility and surgery. Monitor her legs for signs of swelling or pain, and consider prophylactic anticoagulation therapy.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's history of respiratory failure and recent surgery increase her risk of pneumonia. Monitor her chest radiograph and consider antibiotic therapy if she develops signs of pneumonia.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust her oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to manage her pain with morphine and adjust her pain management plan as needed.
3. Monitor her laboratory results and adjust her antibiotic therapy if she develops signs of infection.
4. Monitor her hemoglobin levels and transfuse as needed.
5. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation therapy for DVT.
6. Monitor her chest radiograph for signs of pneumonia and consider antibiotic therapy if necessary."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient was successfully extubated yesterday.  The patient had
   transient desaturation episodes into 80s during sleep last  night.  ABG
   during the episode was 7.26/73/74 on face tent/nasal cannula.  The
   patient was started non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, but was
   noted to have brief periods of apnea on NIPPV with repeat ABG
   7.27/70/139.  It was believed to be secondary to decreased respiratory
   drive due to increased oxygenation, prompting decrease of FIO2 to 30%.
   NIPPV did not seem to provide any additional benefit, pt. appeared more
   confused, ABG stable at 7.27/71/93.   NIPPV was subsequently
   discontinued. This morning, the patient is satting well on 4L NC.  She
   is A+Ox3, responds appropriately to all questions, but appears somewhat
   more somnolent
   This morning the patient is without any specific complaints, denies
   abdominal pain, shortness of breath.  Notes mild back pain improved
   with positioning.  Pain well controlled. The patient is on Morphine
   0.5-1 mg Q4H:PRN, but has not required any doses since yesterday.  No
   flatus as of this morning.  Lopressor held this AM due to SBP in 90s.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #1, with respiratory failure post-operatively.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: History of vocal cord dysfunction and
   kyphosis.   Appears to have chronic retainer with bicarb.  Respiratory
   failure likely precipitated by the sedation in this chonically
   retaining patient with restrctive physiology.
   -SBT this morning.  Will attempt extubation this AM if the patient
   tolerates.  RSBI may be falsely elevated in this elderly patient with
   restrictive anatomy.  The patient appears much more alert and
   responsive this AN, making successful extubation more likely.  Will
   evaluate ABG on SBT.
   - Fentanyl 25-50 mcg bolus for pain control for now; will try to
   minimize narcotics use in this patient

   Disposition: ICU for now ; potential callout today<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an 80-year-old lady, was successfully extubated yesterday but experienced transient desaturation episodes during sleep, prompting the initiation of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). However, NIPPV was discontinued due to brief periods of apnea and decreased respiratory drive. This morning, the patient is saturating well on 4L nasal cannula and appears more somnolent.

The patient is receiving various medications, including morphine, fentanyl, and metoprolol, which have been adjusted as needed. Her pain is well-controlled, but she has not required any doses of morphine since yesterday. She is also experiencing mild back pain, which is improved with positioning.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 106 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 110/57 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 94%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 19.1, hemoglobin of 31.4, and platelet count of 372. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are slightly elevated.

The patient's medical history includes restrictive lung disease from kyphoscoliosis, history of CO2 retention, right-sided vocal cord paralysis, and recent colectomy. She is at risk for respiratory failure due to her chronic retaining and restrictive physiology.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of CO2 retention and restrictive lung disease increases her risk of respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's recent surgery and hospitalization increase her risk of developing pneumonia.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobility and recent surgery.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's DVT risk increases her risk of developing pulmonary embolism.
5. Sepsis: The patient's recent surgery and hospitalization increase her risk of developing sepsis.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has declined slightly, and she may require transfusion.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased, and she may require monitoring and potential treatment.
8. Stress ulcers: The patient's recent surgery and hospitalization increase her risk of developing stress ulcers.
9. VAP: The patient's recent surgery and hospitalization increase her risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
10. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of mild aortic stenosis and recent surgery increase her risk of developing cardiac complications.

Based on the patient's condition, the plan is to continue monitoring her vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory status. The patient will be evaluated for potential extubation this morning, and her pain management will be adjusted as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   80 yof with hx of right open hemi-colectomy and kyphosis re-intubated
   in the PACU with hypercarbia in the setting of underlying restricitve
   ventilatory deficit and narcotis likely leading to relative
   hypoventilation.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Hypercarbic respiratory failure, with
   hypoventilation likely attributed to use of nacrotics/sedatives with
   underlying restrictive physiology (kyphoscloiosis), and evidence for
   chronic respiratory failure (elevated HCO3 at admission).   Overall
   improved since extubation.  Continue nebulizer prn.  Consider BiPAP as
   back up if fails extubation.  Monitor ABG.
   COLON CA -- s/p right hemi-colectomy: received cipro and flagyl in OR.
   Will touch base re: addtional abx (has PCN allergy).  F/u final path.
   Surgicial pain management (bupivicaine local infusion via PCA pump).
   Oncology to F/U.  OOB.
   RENAL FUNCTION
 oliguria, improving with iv fluid repletion.  Monitor
   BUN, creatinine, urine output closel --> may need iv fliud bolus if
   remains marginal.
   FLUIDS
 hypovolemia improved.  Would monitor I/O.
   ANEMIA -- evidence for hemoconcentration post-op, now improving, and
   Hct back to pre-op level.  Monitor Hct.
   ELEVATED WBC
 likely stress-related, but concern for possible evolving
   infection.  No focal signs currently.  Monitor.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM -- continue levothyroxine, adjust dose to iv (fraction
   of home dose).
   AORTIC STENOSIS --  no treatment indicated at ths time (most recent TTE
   in [**2121**]).  Avoid afterload reduction.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old male who was re-intubated in the PACU with hypercarbia in the setting of underlying restrictive ventilatory deficit and narcotic use likely leading to relative hypoventilation. The patient has a history of right open hemi-colectomy and kyphosis, which may be contributing to his restrictive ventilatory deficit.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, with a pCO2 level of 71 mmHg. He was previously on non-invasive ventilation but was taken off due to lack of benefit. He is currently on nasal cannula oxygen.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is 91/38 mmHg, which is low for his age. His heart rate is 100 beats per minute, which is slightly elevated.
* Renal: The patient is experiencing oliguria, which is improving with IV fluid repletion. His creatinine level is 0.4 mg/dL, which is within normal limits.
* Hematological: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.8 g/dL, which is low. His platelet count is 372 K/uL, which is within normal limits.
* Neurological: The patient is alert and oriented, with no signs of sedation or paralysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not managed properly.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient's low blood pressure and tachycardia can increase his risk of cardiac arrest.
* Renal failure: The patient's oliguria and low blood pressure can increase his risk of renal failure.
* Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lack of focal signs of infection can increase his risk of developing a nosocomial infection.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism can worsen if his levothyroxine dose is not adjusted properly.
* Aortic stenosis: The patient's aortic stenosis can worsen if he is exposed to afterload reduction medications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue nebulizer therapy as needed
* Consider BiPAP as a backup if extubation fails
* Monitor ABG levels
* Touch base with oncology regarding additional antibiotics
* Continue surgical pain management with bupivicaine local infusion via PCA pump
* Monitor BUN and creatinine levels closely and consider IV fluid bolus if oliguria persists
* Monitor Hct levels closely
* Continue levothyroxine therapy and adjust dose as needed
* Avoid afterload reduction medications in patients with aortic stenosis.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 80-year-old male with a history of right open hemi-colectomy and kyphosis, who was re-intubated in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) due to hypercarbia in the setting of underlying restrictive ventilatory deficit and narcotics likely leading to relative hypoventilation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely attributed to the use of narcotics/sedatives with underlying restrictive physiology (kyphoscoliosis), and evidence of chronic respiratory failure (elevated HCO3 at admission).
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis, but no treatment is indicated at this time.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of colon cancer and underwent a right hemi-colectomy, and was treated with cipro and flagyl in the OR.
* Renal: The patient is experiencing oliguria, but is improving with IV fluid repletion.
* Fluids: The patient has hypovolemia, which is improving with IV fluid repletion.
* Hematology: The patient has evidence of hemoconcentration post-op, but is improving, and his Hct is back to pre-op level.
* Infection: The patient has an elevated WBC, which is likely stress-related, but there is concern for possible evolving infection, although there are no focal signs currently.
* Endocrine: The patient has hypothyroidism, and is being treated with levothyroxine, with the dose adjusted to IV (fraction of home dose).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying restrictive ventilatory deficit and chronic respiratory failure may lead to further respiratory compromise.
* Infection: The patient's elevated WBC and potential evolving infection may lead to sepsis or organ failure.
* Renal failure: The patient's oliguria and hypovolemia may lead to further renal compromise.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's aortic stenosis may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of colon cancer and recent surgery may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or obstruction.
* Endocrine complications: The patient's hypothyroidism may lead to further complications, such as hypothyroidism-related cardiac problems or cognitive impairment.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Continue nebulizer therapy as needed
* Consider BiPAP as backup if extubation fails
* Monitor ABG
* Continue surgical pain management with bupivicaine local infusion via PCA pump
* Follow up with oncology
* Monitor BUN, creatinine, and urine output closely
* Adjust IV fluid repletion as needed
* Monitor Hct
* Continue levothyroxine therapy and adjust dose to IV (fraction of home dose)
* Avoid afterload reduction in patients with aortic stenosis."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old lady with a history of restrictive lung disease due to kyphoscoliosis, right-sided vocal cord paralysis, and a recent colectomy for colon cancer. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure post-operatively and is currently extubated, saturating well on room air.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 85-109 bpm, blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 28.2%
* Platelet count: 372 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 19.1 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 11 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Glucose: 87 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 139 mEq/L, potassium 3.8 mEq/L, magnesium 1.9 mg/dL, phosphorus 1.0 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is notable for decreased breath sounds at the bases, and her chest x-ray shows a mild increase in bilateral interstitial markings.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: continue to monitor respiratory status, avoid opioids or use in very low doses, and follow up for underlying lung disease.
* Pain management: use opioids in very low doses as needed, and follow surgery recommendations.
* Aortic stenosis: be careful with IV fluids given the patient's aortic stenosis, and monitor for signs of fluid overload.
* Anemia: monitor hematocrit daily and transfuse for a goal of hematocrit < 26 or signs of active bleeding.
* Hypophosphatemia: replete IV phosphorus and recheck in the afternoon.
* Hyperglycemia: check fingersticks and put the patient on an insulin sliding scale.
* Tachycardia: monitor the patient's heart rate and continue metoprolol.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: worsening of hypercarbic respiratory failure, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
* Aortic stenosis: fluid overload, which can lead to heart failure.
* Anemia: bleeding or transfusion-related complications.
* Hypophosphatemia: muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, or respiratory failure.
* Hyperglycemia: ketoacidosis, non-ketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome, or severe hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome.
* Tachycardia: cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   secondary to hypercarbia, however this patient is a chronic retainer
   with pCO2 close to baseline.
   - Repeat ABG to assess CO2 status.
   -Continue low dose Morphine PRN for pain control; minimize due to high
   risk of delirium.
   -Continue Bupivacaine via abd. catheter fort 72 hours

   -OOB in chair; PT consult
   .
   # AS:  Mild AS on clinical exam and TTE one year ago.  The patient
   appears euvolemic on exam, with adequate urinary output.  Hct continues
   to be stable, no signs of active bleed.  Will be careful with IVF given
   AS, fluid shifts post-operatively.
   - Goal I&O even today given euvolemia.
   -LR@50 cc/hr currently; will adjust as needed to achieve above goal.
   #Anemia
 Hct stable with no signs of active bleed
   -Monitor Hct daily and transfuse for goal of Hct < 26 or signs of

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old lady with restrictive lung disease from kyphoscoliosis, history of CO2 retention, R-sided vocal cord paralysis, and s/p colectomy for colon CA. She was successfully extubated yesterday and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen at 4L with a SpO2 of 93%.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 99.1°F, heart rate of 100-120 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/57 mmHg. She has a history of vocal cord dysfunction and kyphosis, which may contribute to her chronic retainer status and somnolence.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of vocal cord dysfunction and kyphosis may increase her risk of respiratory failure, particularly in the post-operative period.
2. Hypercarbia: The patient's chronic retainer status and somnolence may be secondary to hypercarbia, which can exacerbate respiratory failure.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable, but she may be at risk for anemia due to blood loss during surgery or ongoing bleeding.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory response.
5. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to her history of surgery and immobility.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to her history of surgery and critical illness.
7. VAP: The patient is at risk for VAP due to her prolonged intubation and immobility.

To mitigate these risks, the patient will continue to receive low-dose morphine for pain control, and her respiratory status will be closely monitored. She will also receive prophylactic antibiotics for DVT and stress ulcer, and will be monitored for signs of infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of right open hemi-colectomy and kyphosis, who was re-intubated in the PACU with hypercarbia due to underlying restrictive ventilatory deficit and narcotic use.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure with hypoventilation likely attributed to the use of narcotics/sedatives with underlying restrictive physiology (kyphoscoliosis). He is extubated and tolerating sips of clear liquids.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a normal sinus rhythm, and his blood pressure is within normal limits.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has abdominal pain, which is managed with surgical pain management (bupivicaine local infusion via PCA pump).
* Hematological: The patient has evidence of hemoconcentration post-op, which is now improving, and his Hct is back to pre-op level.
* Renal: The patient has oliguria, which is improving with IV fluid repletion. He is at risk of developing hypovolemia, which would require close monitoring of I/O.
* Endocrine: The patient has hypothyroidism, which is managed with levothyroxine, and his dose is being adjusted to IV (fraction of home dose).
* Infectious: The patient has an elevated WBC count, which is likely stress-related, but there are no focal signs of infection. He will be monitored closely.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status can deteriorate further, leading to respiratory failure.
* Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and potential for evolving infection require close monitoring.
* Hypovolemia: The patient's oliguria and risk of developing hypovolemia require close monitoring of I/O.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism requires close monitoring and adjustment of his medication dose.
* Aortic stenosis: The patient's aortic stenosis requires avoidance of afterload reduction and close monitoring.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue nebulizer prn and consider BiPAP as a backup if extubation fails.
* Monitor ABG and adjust therapy accordingly.
* Touch base with oncology regarding additional antibiotics (patient has a PCN allergy).
* Continue surgical pain management (bupivicaine local infusion via PCA pump).
* Monitor BUN, creatinine, and urine output closely and consider IV fluid bolus if oliguria persists.
* Replete hypophosphatemia.
* Monitor Hct and adjust fluid therapy accordingly.
* Continue levothyroxine and adjust dose to IV (fraction of home dose).
* Avoid afterload reduction in patients with aortic stenosis.
* Transfer the patient to the floor once his condition stabilizes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an 80-year-old male, remains extubated and tolerates sips of clear liquids. His pain management has improved with the use of low-dose morphine. The patient's voice remains hoarse due to chronic vocal cord paralysis, but is almost back to baseline.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 91 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 116/56 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 90%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, and his general appearance is normal. His eyes, ears, nose, and throat are normal. His cardiovascular examination shows a normal pulse and blood pressure. His respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds. His abdominal examination shows soft, non-tender bowel sounds. His extremities show trace edema in both lower extremities.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 19.1 K/uL
* Platelet count: 372 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.4 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 28.2 mg/dL
* Glucose: 87 mg/dL
* Calcium: 7.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 1.0 mg/dL

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure is attributed to the use of narcotics and sedatives, underlying restrictive physiology, and evidence of chronic respiratory failure. The patient will continue to receive nebulizer therapy as needed and may require BiPAP as a backup if extubation fails.
* Colon cancer: The patient has a history of right hemicolectomy and received cipro and flagyl in the operating room. He has a penicillin allergy and will require additional antibiotics. Final pathology will be followed up.
* Pain management: The patient will receive cautious use of narcotics and pain medications at low doses.
* Renal function: The patient's oliguria is improving with IV fluid repletion, and his BUN, creatinine, and urine output will be closely monitored.
* Hypophosphatemia: The patient's phosphorus levels will be repleted.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin is improving, and his Hct is back to pre-op levels. His Hct will be monitored.
* Elevated WBC: The patient's elevated WBC count is likely stress-related, but there is concern for possible evolving infection. The patient will be monitored for any signs of infection.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient will continue to receive levothyroxine, and his dose will be adjusted to IV (fraction of home dose).
* Aortic stenosis: The patient has a history of aortic stenosis, but no treatment is currently indicated. Avoidance of afterload reduction is recommended.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:
