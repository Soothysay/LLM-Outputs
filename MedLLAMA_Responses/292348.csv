   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure
   History suggestive of a URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would
   also consider pna though no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr
   here. Given HD, fluid overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in
   hospital may be secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T
   changes present on her EKG though acute ischemia less likely.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary
   reserve is limited given her morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also
   worsen breathing especially while supine. In terms of other causes of
   her SOB, poor rate control of her atrial fibrillation is another
   importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -         iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -          guiac stools and
   -         follow hct daily.
   -         Maintain Type and screen.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AFib), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation of tracheobronchomalacia and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia, and has a history of C. difficile colitis. She is also at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE) due to her limited mobility and subtherapeutic anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to tracheobronchomalacia, morbid obesity, and limited pulmonary reserve. She is at risk for further respiratory decline and may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Fever: The patient's fever is likely due to C. difficile colitis, pneumonia, or PE. She is at risk for recurrent C. difficile colitis and may require empiric antibiotics.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is at risk for PE due to her limited mobility and subtherapeutic anticoagulation. She may require further evaluation with a CT scan or ventilation-perfusion scan.
4. End-Stage Renal Disease: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis, and she is at risk for further kidney damage.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's AFib is poorly controlled and may require further medication adjustments. She is at risk for cardiac complications, such as stroke or heart failure.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is likely due to her kidney disease and may require further medication adjustments.
7. Leg Wounds: The patient's leg wounds are at risk for further complications, such as infection or delayed healing.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to her kidney disease and may require further evaluation and treatment.
9. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety may be related to her underlying medical conditions and may require further treatment with medication or therapy.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her underlying medical conditions to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure
   History suggestive of a URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would
   also consider pna though no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr
   here. Given HD, fluid overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in
   hospital may be secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T
   changes present on her EKG though acute ischemia less likely.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary
   reserve is limited given her morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also
   worsen breathing especially while supine. In terms of other causes of
   her SOB, poor rate control of her atrial fibrillation is another
   importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -         iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -          guiac stools and
   -         follow hct daily.
   -         Maintain Type and screen.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications may arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of tracheobronchomalacia, morbid obesity, and multinodular goiter, which may worsen breathing difficulties. The patient's pulmonary reserve is limited, and the large goiter may worsen breathing, especially while supine.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has a history of URI/bronchitis, and the CXR shows no clear infiltrate. However, the patient's symptoms, such as fever and SOB, suggest PNA as a possible diagnosis.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, and the CT chest did not show any PE. However, the patient is at significant risk for DVT and PE due to her limited mobility and subtherapeutic anticoagulation.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient has a history of ESRD and is on HD. The patient's creatinine level is 3.3 mg/dL, which is slightly elevated.
5. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient's rate is poorly controlled on metoprolol, and the INR is supra-therapeutic. The patient's AF may be contributing to her tachycardia and may require further management.
6. HTN: The patient's BP is 141/106 mmHg, which is slightly elevated. The patient's HTN may be contributing to her tachycardia and may require further management.
7. Leg wounds: The patient has two well-healing wounds on her medial upper thighs. The patient's leg wounds may be at risk for further complications, such as infection or delayed healing.
8. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 11.0 g/dL, which is slightly low. The patient's anemia may be due to her renal insufficiency and phlebotomy.
9. Anxiety: The patient has a history of anxiety and is currently taking zoloft. The patient's anxiety may be contributing to her tachycardia and may require further management.

The patient's current medications include:

* Metoprolol (50 TID)
* Warfarin (hold due to supra-therapeutic INR)
* ASA 325 daily
* Flagyl (pending C diff toxin assay)
* Zoloft (confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed)

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Bronchoscopy to further workup?TBM likely Monday
* CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for PNA
* Hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and AF not well rate controlled
* EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
* Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through early from Q 8 dosing
* FEN continue tube feeds, npo after midnight Sunday
* Access central line -> remove and place PICC in AM
* PPX therapeutic on warfarin, contact precautions
* Dispo ICU"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure
   History suggestive of a URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would
   also consider pna though no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr
   here. Given HD, fluid overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in
   hospital may be secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T
   changes present on her EKG though acute ischemia less likely.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary
   reserve is limited given her morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also
   worsen breathing especially while supine. In terms of other causes of
   her SOB, poor rate control of her atrial fibrillation is another
   importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes
   - ASA 325 daily
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR therapeutic currently, continue warfarin
   - Will review CT chest with radiology here
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN
   Continue metoprolol
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   Will consult wound care for local care recommendations
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate, guiac stools and follow hct
   daily. Type and screen.
   .
   10. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AF), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management of respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: She is on invasive ventilation with a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 32 cmH2O and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Her respiratory rate (RR) is set at 16 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 100%.
* Cardiovascular: She has AF with a heart rate (HR) of 101 beats per minute. Her blood pressure (BP) is 141/106 mmHg.
* Neurological: She is alert and awake, able to write answers to questions on a whiteboard, and has no gross focal deficits.
* Hemodynamic: Her central venous pressure (CVP) is not assessable due to a large neck, and her peripheral edema is bilateral in the lower extremities.
* Laboratory: Her white blood cell count (WBC) is 7.6 x 109/L, and her platelet count (PLT) is 218 x 109/L. Her creatinine (Cr) level is 3.3 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 28 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure can worsen due to her underlying tracheobronchomalacia, morbid obesity, and limited pulmonary reserve.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's risk of PE is increased due to her history of subtherapeutic anticoagulation, limited mobility, and underlying cardiovascular disease.
3. Fever: The patient's fever can be due to various causes, including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or cellulitis. She is at risk of recurrent Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) colitis due to her recent broad-spectrum antibiotic use.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's AF can worsen due to her underlying cardiovascular disease and limited rate control.
5. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient's ESRD can worsen due to her underlying kidney disease, hypertension, and limited access to dialysis.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Respiratory support: Continue invasive ventilation and adjust settings as needed.
2. Cardiovascular support: Increase metoprolol to 50 mg three times a day to control AF.
3. Anticoagulation: Continue warfarin and monitor international normalized ratio (INR).
4. Infection control: Evaluate for pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or cellulitis, and treat accordingly.
5. Nutrition: Start tube feeds tonight and monitor for any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Wound care: Consult wound care for local care recommendations for the patient's leg wounds.
7. Anemia: Check reticulocyte count, smear, iron panel, B12, folate, and guaiac stools, and follow up with hemoglobin (Hb) daily.
8. Anxiety: Confirm home zoloft and restart along with ativan as needed.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal functions to prevent complications and improve her clinical outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed tomorrow and then extubated following.  If the patient
   does well, then no need for bronchoscopy, if the patient does not do
   well, then she will undergo bronchoscopy to evaluate for
   tracheobronchomalacia.
   - Follow cultures
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever:  Currently afebrile, mildly elevated temps overnight.  C diff
   negative.  Will discontinue flagyl.  Will trend and culture if spikes.
   Hold all antibiotics for now.
   .
   3. ?  Pulmonary embolism:  Will attempt to get Attending read on OSH
   Chest CT to eval for PE.  INR sub therapeutic currently for PICC
   placement this AM, will need to hold today as well as pt requires
   replacement of the PICC by IR tomorrow.  If there is evidence of PE,
   will need to start on heparin drip.
   .
   4. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD tomorrow
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation:  Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**]
   metoprolol, will increased to 50 TID.
   - Restart coumadin today
   .
   6. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   7. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   8. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -          guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   9. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.
   .
   FEN continue tube feeds, npo after midnight Sunday, replete lytes
   Access central line -> remove and place PICC in AM

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed tomorrow and then extubated following.  If the patient
   does well, then no need for bronchoscopy, if the patient does not do
   well, then she will undergo bronchoscopy to evaluate for
   tracheobronchomalacia.
   - Follow cultures
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever:  Currently afebrile, mildly elevated temps overnight.  C diff
   negative.  Will discontinue flagyl.  Will trend and culture if spikes.
   Hold all antibiotics for now.
   .
   3. ?  Pulmonary embolism:  Will attempt to get Attending read on OSH
   Chest CT to eval for PE.  INR sub therapeutic currently for PICC
   placement this AM, will need to hold today as well as pt requires
   replacement of the PICC by IR tomorrow.  If there is evidence of PE,
   will need to start on heparin drip.
   .
   4. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD tomorrow
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation:  Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**]
   metoprolol, will increased to 50 TID.
   - Restart coumadin today
   .
   6. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   7. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   8. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -          guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   9. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.
   .
   FEN continue tube feeds, npo after midnight Sunday, replete lytes
   Access central line -> remove and place PICC in AM
   PPX therapeutic on warfarin, contact precautions

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure
   History suggestive of a URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would
   also consider pna though no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr
   here. Given HD, fluid overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in
   hospital may be secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T
   changes present on her EKG though acute ischemia less likely.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary
   reserve is limited given her morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also
   worsen breathing especially while supine. In terms of other causes of
   her SOB, poor rate control of her atrial fibrillation is another
   importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -           guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   10. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure
   History suggestive of a URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would
   also consider pna though no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr
   here. Given HD, fluid overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in
   hospital may be secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T
   changes present on her EKG though acute ischemia less likely.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary
   reserve is limited given her morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also
   worsen breathing especially while supine. In terms of other causes of
   her SOB, poor rate control of her atrial fibrillation is another
   importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -           guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   10. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.
   .
   FEN continue tube feeds, npo after midnight Sunday, replete lytes
   Access central line -> remove and place PICC in AM
   PPX therapeutic on warfarin, contact precautions

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management of her respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, and her pulmonary reserve is limited due to her morbid obesity and tracheobronchomalacia.
* Cardiac status: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is poorly rate-controlled. She also has a history of hypertension.
* Hemodynamic status: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but her heart rate is tachycardic.
* Renal status: The patient has ESRD and is on hemodialysis.
* Infectious disease status: The patient has a history of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and may have pneumonia. She is at risk for recurrent Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) colitis due to her recent broad-spectrum antibiotics.
* Nutritional status: The patient is receiving tube feeds and is at risk for malnutrition due to her morbid obesity and chronic disease state.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is already compromised, and further deterioration may lead to respiratory failure.
* Pneumonia: The patient's recent broad-spectrum antibiotics may have caused C. difficile colitis, and she is at risk for pneumonia due to her chronic respiratory disease.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation is poorly rate-controlled, and further cardiac complications, such as atrial flutter or ventricular tachycardia, may occur.
* Renal failure: The patient's ESRD may worsen, leading to further renal failure.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections, including UTIs, pneumonia, and C. difficile colitis.
* Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and further malnutrition may occur due to her chronic disease state.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Further evaluation and management of her respiratory failure, including bronchoscopy and CXR.
* Management of her atrial fibrillation, including rate control and anticoagulation.
* Further evaluation and management of her infectious disease status, including C. difficile colitis and pneumonia.
* Management of her nutritional status, including tube feeds and nutritional supplements.
* Monitoring of her hemodynamic status, including blood pressure and heart rate.
* Monitoring of her renal status, including creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to the ICU."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition, admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever of unknown origin. The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure, end-stage renal disease, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's current condition is marked by impaired skin integrity, cellulitis, and respiratory failure. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, and their vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 142/81 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's fever of unknown origin and the presence of cellulitis, there is a high risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and even death.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure and current respiratory failure could lead to further deterioration, requiring more aggressive respiratory support or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).
3. Renal Failure: The patient's end-stage renal disease and current renal failure could lead to further deterioration, requiring dialysis or even renal replacement therapy.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation could lead to cardiac complications, such as stroke or cardiac arrest, particularly if not adequately managed.
5. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and cellulitis increase the risk of developing further infections, which could be life-threatening.
6. Multi-Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): The patient's complex medical condition and the presence of sepsis, respiratory failure, and renal failure increase the risk of developing MODS, which could lead to a poor outcome.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely to identify any changes in their condition.
2. Manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with anticoagulation therapy and rate control measures.
3. Continue to provide mechanical ventilation and adjust the settings as needed to maintain optimal oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's regimen if the culture results are positive.
5. Monitor the patient's skin integrity and cellulitis closely, and consider debridement or surgical intervention if necessary.
6. Consider dialysis or renal replacement therapy if the patient's renal function continues to deteriorate.
7. Monitor the patient's cardiac function closely, and consider echocardiography or other cardiac imaging studies to assess cardiac function and identify any potential cardiac complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed tomorrow and then extubated following.  If the patient
   does well, then no need for bronchoscopy
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -           guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   10. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.
   .
   FEN continue tube feeds, npo after midnight Sunday, replete lytes
   Access central line -> remove and place PICC in AM
   PPX therapeutic on warfarin, contact precautions

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed tomorrow and then extubated following.  If the patient
   does well, then no need for bronchoscopy
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -           guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   10. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further evaluation and management of her respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place. She has a history of recurrent C. difficile colitis and is at risk for recurrent infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, secondary to OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD, goiter, and URI/bronchitis. Tracheobronchomalacia may also have contributed to her difficulties tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation.
2. Fever: The patient is at risk for recurrent C. difficile colitis and pneumonia. She has a history of loose stools and recent broad-spectrum antibiotics, which increases her risk of recurrent infection.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, which may be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time, but her limited mobility and subtherapeutic anticoagulation put her at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
4. ESRD on HD: The patient requires hemodialysis and will need to be dialyzed while in the ICU.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is poorly controlled, and her INR is supra-therapeutic. She will need to be monitored closely to ensure her anticoagulation is therapeutic.
6. HTN: The patient's hypertension is not well-controlled, and she will need to be monitored closely to ensure her blood pressure is controlled.
7. Leg wounds: The patient has leg wounds that require wound care and follow-up.
8. Anemia: The patient has anemia that is likely secondary to her ESRD and phlebotomy. She will need to be monitored closely to ensure her anemia does not worsen.
9. Anxiety: The patient has anxiety that will need to be managed with medications and therapy.
10. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity that will need to be monitored and managed to prevent further complications.

ICU Care:

* Nutrition: The patient will need to continue tube feeds and will be NPO after midnight on Sunday.
* Glycemic control: The patient's blood glucose levels will need to be monitored and managed to prevent hyperglycemia.
* Lines: The patient has multiple lines in place, including a central line and dialysis catheter.
* Prophylaxis: The patient will need to receive prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.
* Comments: The patient's family has been informed of her condition and has been given code status of full code."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely mulHistory suggestive of a
   URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would also consider pna though
   no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr here. Given HD, fluid
   overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in hospital may be
   secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T changes present on
   her EKG though acute ischemia less likely. Tracheobronchomalacia may
   have been contributory to her difficulties tolerating discontinuation
   of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her
   morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also worsen breathing especially
   while supine. In terms of other causes of her SOB, poor rate control of
   her atrial fibrillation is another importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.

   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at

   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay

   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD

   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely mulHistory suggestive of a
   URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would also consider pna though
   no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr here. Given HD, fluid
   overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in hospital may be
   secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T changes present on
   her EKG though acute ischemia less likely. Tracheobronchomalacia may
   have been contributory to her difficulties tolerating discontinuation
   of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her
   morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also worsen breathing especially
   while supine. In terms of other causes of her SOB, poor rate control of
   her atrial fibrillation is another importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -           guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AFib), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management of respiratory failure, fever, and pulmonary embolism (PE). She is currently on mechanical ventilation, and her vital signs are stable, but her respiratory status is concerning.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to her morbid obesity, tracheobronchomalacia, and limited pulmonary reserve. Pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and fluid overload are possible causes of her respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's fever, cough, and abnormal chest radiograph suggest the possibility of pneumonia. The sputum culture and gram stain are pending, and the patient is being treated empirically with antibiotics.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and subtherapeutic anticoagulation therapy increase her risk of PE. The CT chest scan did not show any PE, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are concerning.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's AFib is poorly controlled, and her INR is supra-therapeutic. She is at risk of bleeding and may require closer monitoring and adjustment of her anticoagulation therapy.
5. End-Stage Renal Disease: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing hemodialysis, and her fluid overload is a concern. Her potassium levels are slightly elevated, and she may require closer monitoring of her electrolyte levels.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely related to her ESRD and phlebotomy. Her reticulocyte count and smear are pending, and she may require iron supplementation and other therapies to manage her anemia.
7. Fever: The patient's fever is of unknown origin and may be related to pneumonia, PE, or other causes. She is at risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis, and her stool culture is pending.
8. Leg Wounds: The patient has wounds on her legs that are at risk of infection and may require further evaluation and management.
9. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety is being managed with zoloft and ativan, but she may require further therapy and support.

ICU Care:

The patient requires ongoing ICU care, including close monitoring of her vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory results. She requires ongoing hemodialysis, and her fluid overload is a concern. She may require further therapy and support to manage her anemia, anxiety, and other medical conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD and
   URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH, would also consider pna though
   no reported fevers, no clear infiltrate on cxr here. Given HD, fluid
   overload is another possibility. Increased SOB in hospital may be
   secondary to PE, would also consider MI given ST/T changes present on
   her EKG though acute ischemia less likely. Tracheobronchomalacia may
   have been contributory to her difficulties tolerating discontinuation
   of mechanical ventilation. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her
   morbid obesity. Her large goiter may also worsen breathing especially
   while supine. In terms of other causes of her SOB, poor rate control of
   her atrial fibrillation is another importance consideration.
   - IP to pursue bronchoscopy to further workup ?TBM likely Monday per IP
   - CXR, sputum gram stain and culture to evaluate for pna
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - EKG, cycle cardiac enzymes-currently pending
   - ASA 325 daily
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever
   In the setting of loose stools and recent broad spectrum abx she is at
   significant risk of recurrent C. difficile colitis. Pna is another
   consideration. PE itself could cause mild fever though to 101F less
   likely.
   - CXR, sputum as above. Also check blood and urine cx, UA, stool C diff
   - Empiric flagyl pending C diff toxin assay
   .
   3. Pulmonary embolism
   Patient with significant RV dysfunction on her OSH echo, but this may
   be secondary to her OSA. She is hemodynamically stable at this time. It
   appears she had been subtherapeutic on her anticoagulation which in
   concert with her very limited mobility puts her at significant risk for
   DVT and PE.
   - INR supra-therapeutic currently, continue to assess need for warfarin
   based on daily INR
   - CT chest per rads did not show any PE, PNA.  Did have b/l small
   pleural effusions
   .
   4. ESRD on HD
   Gets HD [**Last Name (LF) 5280**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] arrange for HD while in house
   .
   6. Atrial fibrillation
   Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol, will increased to
   50 TID.
   - Hold warfarin today given INR 3.2, repeat INR in AM
   .
   7. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   8. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   9. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -           guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   10. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.
   .
   FEN continue tube feeds, npo after midnight Sunday, replete lytes
   Access central line -> remove and place PICC in AM

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of her respiratory failure, fever, and potential pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 97 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 142/81 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation to support her respiratory function.

The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial and secondary to OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, chronic heart failure (CHF), volume overload from ESRD, and upper respiratory tract infection (URI)/bronchitis prior to transfer to the ICU. She also has a large goiter, which may worsen her breathing, especially when supine.

The patient is at risk for recurrent Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) colitis due to loose stools and recent broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Pneumonia is another consideration, and a CXR, sputum gram stain and culture, and blood and urine cultures have been ordered to evaluate for this possibility.

The patient has a history of PE, which is a concern given her significant right ventricular (RV) dysfunction on her outpatient echocardiogram (echo) and her limited mobility. She is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy, and her international normalized ratio (INR) is supra-therapeutic.

The patient has a number of other medical issues, including anemia, which is likely secondary to her ESRD and phlebotomy. She also has a history of iron deficiency and is at risk for acute inflammatory changes or suppression of chronic disease. An iron panel, B12, and folate have been ordered to evaluate her anemia further.

The patient is also at risk for anxiety and has a history of zoloft use. She will be restarted on this medication, along with ativan as needed, to manage her anxiety.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Recurrent C. difficile colitis: The patient's history of loose stools and recent broad-spectrum antibiotic use puts her at risk for recurrent C. difficile colitis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's history of URI/bronchitis and her current symptoms of fever and cough make pneumonia a possibility.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of PE and her current symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath make pulmonary embolism a concern.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and her current symptoms of palpitations and shortness of breath make atrial fibrillation a concern.
5. Anemia: The patient's history of anemia and her current symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath make anemia a concern.
6. Cellulitis: The patient's history of cellulitis and her current symptoms of swelling and redness make cellulitis a possibility.
7. Renal failure: The patient's history of ESRD and her current symptoms of decreased urine output make renal failure a concern.
8. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and her current symptoms of headache and shortness of breath make hypertension a concern.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a number of medical complications, and close monitoring and management of her conditions are necessary to prevent these complications from occurring."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed today and then extubated following.  If the patient does
   well, then no need for bronchoscopy, if the patient does not do well,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed today and then extubated following.  If the patient does
   well, then no need for bronchoscopy, if the patient does not do well,
   then she will undergo bronchoscopy to evaluate for
   tracheobronchomalacia.

   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AFib), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial and secondary to obesity hypoventilation syndrome, chronic heart failure, volume overload from ESRD, goiter, and upper respiratory tract infection/bronchitis.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 50%, and PS 5 cmH2O. Her SpO2 is 100%.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation with a poorly controlled heart rate. Her blood pressure is 98/59 mmHg.
* Hemodynamic: The patient has a central venous catheter and is receiving fluids, with a total fluid input of 1,427 mL and a total fluid output of 0 mL.
* Renal: The patient is on hemodialysis three times a week and is scheduled to receive dialysis today.
* Neurological: The patient is alert and awake, with no gross focal deficits.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): White blood cell count 7.6 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin 10.8 g/dL, platelet count 19 x 10^9/L.
* Electrolytes: Sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 4.3 mmol/L, chloride 99 mmol/L, magnesium 2.3 mmol/L, phosphorus 4.7 mmol/L.
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 29 mg/dL, creatinine 5.1 mg/dL.
* Troponin-T 0.22 ng/mL.

The patient's potential medical complications are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial and may be exacerbated by her morbid obesity, chronic heart failure, and goiter.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's chest CT scan shows a 50% chance of a small right lower lobe pulmonary embolism, which may not require anticoagulation.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is poorly controlled, and her heart rate is not well-controlled.
4. Anemia: The patient has a history of iron deficiency and is anemic, which may be related to her chronic kidney disease and phlebotomy.
5. Leg wounds: The patient has well-healing wounds on her medial upper thighs, which may require further wound care and management.
6. Fever: The patient has a mildly elevated temperature, which may be related to her underlying medical conditions or a urinary tract infection.
7. Cellulitis: The patient has a red rash on her right arm, which may be related to her central line or a skin infection.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Respiratory: The patient will be extubated following hemodialysis today, and if she does well, bronchoscopy will not be performed.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's atrial fibrillation will be managed with metoprolol, and her Coumadin will be restarted.
* Hemodynamic: The patient's fluids will be managed to maintain a balanced fluid status.
* Renal: The patient will receive hemodialysis today and will be monitored for any changes in her renal function.
* Neurological: The patient will be monitored for any changes in her neurological status.

In summary, the patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems who is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. She has a complex medical condition that requires careful management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-inch tall individual with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, chronic, and is intubated on CPAP/PSV with a FiO2 of 50%. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, and blood pressure of 98/59 mmHg.

The patient has a 50% chance of having a small right lower segment pulmonary embolism (PE), but the radiology report is poor. The patient is being treated with Coumadin and will undergo a bronchoscopy after extubation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 7.6-12.1 K/uL
* Hct: 33.1-34.9%
* Plt: 19 K/uL
* Cr: 3.0-5.1 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.22-0.23 ng/mL
* TCO2: 32 mmHg
* Glucose: 79-109 mg/dL

The patient has impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, chronic, fever of unknown origin, cellulitis, and end-stage renal disease. The patient requires close monitoring and management of their respiratory and cardiovascular status.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's chronic respiratory disease
* Cardiac arrhythmias due to atrial fibrillation
* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's fever and cellulitis
* Renal failure exacerbation due to the patient's end-stage renal disease
* Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's use of anticoagulants and stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged intubation."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed tomorrow and then extubated following.  If the patient
   does well, then no need for bronchoscopy, if the patient does not do
   well, then she will undergo bronchoscopy to evaluate for
   tracheobronchomalacia.
   - Follow cultures
   - Will hold on further bronchodilators as not wheezing now and afib not
   well rate controlled
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever:  Currently afebrile, mildly elevated temps overnight.  C diff
   negative.  Will discontinue flagyl.  Will trend and culture if spikes.
   Hold all antibiotics for now.
   .
   3. ?  Pulmonary embolism:  Will attempt to get Attending read on OSH
   Chest CT to eval for PE.  INR sub therapeutic currently for PICC
   placement this AM, will need to hold today as well as pt requires
   replacement of the PICC by IR tomorrow.  If there is evidence of PE,
   will need to start on heparin drip.
   .
   4. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD tomorrow
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation:  Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**]
   metoprolol, will increased to 50 TID.
   - Restart coumadin today
   .
   6. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   7. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   8. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup.
   -          iron panel, b12, folate-pending
   -          guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.
   .
   9. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.
   .
   FEN continue tube feeds, npo after midnight Sunday, replete lytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including ESRD on HD, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and OSA, is being treated in the ICU for respiratory failure, fever, and potential pulmonary embolism. She was intubated and has been receiving mechanical ventilation, but her pulmonary reserve is limited due to her morbid obesity. The patient's temperature has been mildly elevated overnight, and she has been afebrile for the past 24 hours. She has a history of C. difficile-negative diarrhea and has been receiving antibiotics for pneumonia, which have been held due to afebrile status.

The patient's current medications include Coumadin, metoprolol, and triamcinolone cream for facial rash. She has a PICC line in place, which needs to be readjusted by IR tomorrow. She has also been receiving Ativan for agitation.

The patient's physical examination reveals a generally obese woman with a tracheostomy scar at the base of her neck, bilateral rhonchi in her lungs, and warm, 2+ edema in her bilateral lower extremities. Her blood pressure is 98/59 mmHg, and her heart rate is 79 bpm. Her SpO2 is 100%, and her ABG shows a pH of 7.29, pCO2 of 29 mmHg, and pO2 of 86 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory reserve is limited due to her morbid obesity, and she may be at risk for further respiratory decline.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a 50% chance of having a small right lower lobe pulmonary embolism, which could worsen her respiratory status.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not well rate-controlled, which could lead to further cardiac complications.
4. ESRD on HD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and requires regular hemodialysis, which could lead to further complications if not managed properly.
5. Anemia: The patient has a history of iron deficiency and may be at risk for further anemia if not managed properly.
6. Cellulitis: The patient has a history of cellulitis and may be at risk for further skin infections.
7. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity due to her morbid obesity and may be at risk for further skin breakdown.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   1. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - IP does not plan to pursue bronchoscopy, they would like the patient
   to be dialyzed today and then extubated following.  If the patient does
   well, then no need for bronchoscopy, if the patient does not do well,
   then she will undergo bronchoscopy to evaluate for
   tracheobronchomalacia.
   - Follow cultures
   - Hold abx for pneumonia as long as afebrile and cultures pending.
   .
   2. Fever:  Currently afebrile, mildly elevated temps overnight.  C diff
   negative.  Will discontinue flagyl.  Will trend and culture if spikes.
   Hold all antibiotics for now.
   .
   3. ?  Pulmonary embolism:  Will attempt to get Attending read on OSH
   Chest CT to eval for PE.  INR sub therapeutic currently for PICC
   placement this AM, will need to hold today as well as pt requires
   replacement of the PICC by IR tomorrow.
   -Likely small PE that does not merit anticoagulation.  Coincidentally
   on Coumadin for A fib, will not bridge with heparin
   .
   4. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD today
   .
   5. Atrial fibrillation:  Rate currently poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**]
   metoprolol, will increased to 50 TID.
   - Restart coumadin today
   - Follow daily INR
   .
   6. HTN-Received 5 mg IV metoprolol x 2 on arrival for tachycardia to
   150
s.  As well as 50 mg PO metoprolol. Tachycardia again this morning,
   but remains normotensive
   -Continue metoprolol-may need more frequent dosing if breaks through
   early from Q 8 dosing
   .
   7. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   8. Anemia
   [**Month (only) 51**] be [**1-30**] to renal insufficiency and phlebotomy. Per records she does
   have history of Fe deficiency. No gross bleeding currently. Check
   retic-low, smear-decreased retics.  Could represent acute inflammatory
   change vs. suppression of chronic disease.  Will evaluate other labs
   prior to further workup. Likely AOCD, ferritin high but also acute
   phase reactant.  Of note B12 also high
   -          guiac stools and
   -          follow hct daily.
   -          Maintain Type and screen.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AF), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management of her respiratory failure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, and blood pressure of 118/69 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 23 inspirations per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial, secondary to OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, chronic heart failure (CHF), volume overload from ESRD, goiter, and upper respiratory tract infection (URI)/bronchitis. She has also had a recent episode of fever, which has resolved.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL, and a platelet count of 335 K/uL. Her white blood cell count is 7.6 K/uL, and her C-reactive protein (CRP) is 0.23 mg/dL. Her troponin-T level is 0.22 ng/mL, and her creatinine level is 4.4 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions include ESRD on HD, AF, hypertension, and anemia. She has a history of leg wounds and is at risk for further skin breakdown. She is also at risk for pulmonary embolism (PE) due to her morbid obesity and immobility.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Respiratory support: The patient will continue to receive oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed.
2. Fever management: The patient will be monitored for fever and treated with antibiotics if necessary.
3. ESRD management: The patient will receive HD three times a week.
4. AF management: The patient will receive anticoagulation therapy with warfarin, and her INR will be monitored daily.
5. Anemia management: The patient will receive iron supplements and will have her hemoglobin level monitored regularly.
6. Leg wound care: The patient will receive wound care and dressing changes as needed.
7. Pulmonary embolism prophylaxis: The patient will receive anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and will be monitored for signs of PE.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she does not receive adequate oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to her morbid obesity, immobility, and respiratory failure.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk for developing PE due to her morbid obesity and immobility.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient is at risk for further skin breakdown due to her leg wounds and immobility.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if she does not receive adequate iron supplements and hemoglobin monitoring.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if she does not receive adequate antihypertensive therapy.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her medical conditions to prevent potential complications and improve her outcomes."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   #. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,

   - follow IP recs regarding if they want to do bronchoscopy today, may
   not be necessary.
   - Follow cultures
   - Hold abx as no sign of infection currently.
   - Volume removal with HD
   - Very small chance she has a PE after discussion with attending
   radiologist, continue coumadin for A fib
   - Holding albuterol given tachycardia, restarting ipratropium
   .
   #. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD tomorrow

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including ESRD on HD, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and OSA. She was transferred to the ICU for IP evaluation for tracheobronchomalacia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: The patient is extubated and receiving oxygen via nasal cannula. She has a SpO2 of 99% and is tolerating CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is taking metoprolol and coumadin. Her blood pressure is 118/69 mmHg, and her heart rate is 100 bpm.
* Renal status: The patient is on HD three times a week and has end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
* Wound status: The patient has multiple wounds on her legs, which are healing.
* Laboratory results:
	+ WBC: 7.6-12.1 K/uL
	+ Hct: 33.1-34.9%
	+ Plt: 335-19 K/uL
	+ Cr: 3.0-5.1 mg/dL
	+ TropT: 0.22-0.23 ng/mL
	+ TCO2: 32 mg/dL
	+ Glucose: 79-109 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory reserve is limited due to her morbid obesity, and she may be at risk for respiratory failure if her oxygenation and ventilation requirements increase.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may lead to cardiac complications, such as stroke or heart failure, if not properly managed.
* Renal complications: The patient's ESRD may lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or uremic syndrome if not properly managed.
* Wound complications: The patient's wounds may become infected or develop complications such as cellulitis or abscesses if not properly managed.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, or other complications.
* Anxiety: The patient's anxiety may worsen if not properly managed, leading to complications such as agitation, delirium, or other psychiatric symptoms.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* IP evaluation for tracheobronchomalacia
* Follow-up cultures
* Holding antibiotics as no sign of infection currently
* Volume removal with HD
* Restarting coumadin for atrial fibrillation
* Holding albuterol due to tachycardia and restarting ipratropium
* FEN restarting tube feeds after extubation and repleting electrolytes
* Access central line and removing it in the morning
* PPX subtherapeutic on warfarin and contact precautions
* Disposition to the ICU"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter,
   and OSA who is transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for
   ?tracheobronchomalacia
   .
   #. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.
   Tracheobronchomalacia may have been contributory to her difficulties
   tolerating discontinuation of mechanical ventilation, however less
   likely. Her pulmonary reserve is limited given her morbid obesity.
   - Formal bronchoscopy tomorrow in suite by IP to determine if
   subglottic stenosis is present and to determine degree of external
   compression by goiter .
   - Follow cultures, hold abx as no sign of infection currently.
   - Volume removal with HD today
   - Very small chance she has a PE after discussion with attending
   radiologist, continue coumadin for A fib
   - Holding albuterol given tachycardia, restarting ipratropium
   .
   #. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF as an outpatient
   - Renal on board
   - Will get HD today for more volume removal
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation:  Was poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol,
   increased to 75 TID with better control.
   - Restarted coumadin
   - Follow daily INR, currently 1.4 but does not require heparin bridge
   .
   #. HTN:  Better controlled now.
   -Continue metoprolol only at increased dose
   .
   #. Leg wounds
   -f/u wound care recs
   .
   #. Anemia:  Most likely secondary to ESRD.
   - guiac stools and
   - follow hct daily.
   - Maintain type and screen.
   .
   #. Anxiety
   Confirm home zoloft, ok to restart along with ativan as needed.
   .
   FEN regular renal diet, replete lytes PRN

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation (AFib), tracheobronchomalacia, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to the ICU for further evaluation and management of her tracheobronchomalacia. The patient has been extubated and is currently receiving nasal cannula oxygen therapy. She has a history of respiratory failure, chronic, and is at risk for further respiratory complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory reserve is limited due to her morbid obesity, and she is at risk for further respiratory complications, including pneumonia, respiratory failure, and chronic respiratory disease.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's AFib is poorly controlled, and she is at risk for further arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest.
3. End-Stage Renal Disease: The patient's ESRD is managed with HD, and she is at risk for further complications, including acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiovascular disease.
4. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient's tracheobronchomalacia may be contributing to her respiratory difficulties, and she is at risk for further respiratory complications, including bronchospasm and respiratory failure.
5. Cellulitis: The patient has a history of cellulitis, and she is at risk for further skin infections, including impetigo, folliculitis, and abscesses.
6. Fever, Unknown Origin: The patient has a fever of unknown origin, and she is at risk for further infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's ESRD is managed with HD, and she is at risk for further complications, including acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and cardiovascular disease.
8. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and she is at risk for further complications, including fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to continue close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, and renal function. Further evaluation and management of her tracheobronchomalacia, AFib, and ESRD are necessary to prevent further complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical history. The patient's condition is stable, but they have multiple ongoing medical issues.

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 100 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 118/69 mmHg. The patient is on invasive ventilation, which was stopped earlier in the day, but they still require oxygen therapy via a nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is currently ongoing. They also have chronic respiratory failure and are at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be related to their prolonged hospital stay and immobility.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and creatinine levels, indicating possible infection and kidney damage. They also have an elevated troponin level, which may indicate cardiac injury.

The patient's plan of care includes ongoing respiratory support, nutrition, and glycemic control. They require ongoing monitoring for sepsis, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrhythmias. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is unclear.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of fever and elevated white blood cell count, they are at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to increased oxygen requirements and potential respiratory arrest.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's ongoing atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac complications.
4. Kidney damage: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate possible kidney damage, which may worsen if not addressed.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient's impaired skin integrity may worsen if not addressed, leading to potential skin breakdown and infection.
6. VAP: The patient's history of invasive ventilation and ongoing respiratory support makes them at risk for developing VAP.
7. End-stage renal disease: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of end-stage renal disease may worsen if not addressed.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and addressing any potential complications promptly to prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, multinodular goiter, and OSA who was
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for cause of frequent intubations and
   concern for tracheobronchomalacia.
   .
   #. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.  The patient
   underwent formal bronchoscopy today which showed 80% stenosis of her
   trachea at the level of her previous tracheostomy stoma.  The patient
   will go to the OR tomorrow for correction of the stenosis.
   - FFP and desmopressin to the OR tomorrow.
   - Hold coumadin tonight, restart per IP
   - Cultures negative, afebrile, no leukocytosis, therefore infectious
   process unlikely to be a cause of respiratory failure, no antibiotics.
   - Volume removal with HD, due [**Hospital1 511**].
   - ipratropium nebulizer treatments as needed, hold albuterol as
   tachycardic
   - dexamethasone for inflammation
   - Heli-Ox for stridor overnight
   - If requires intubation, will need very small tube.
   .
   #. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF as an outpatient.  Renal on board.
   - HD provided for volume removal, due [**Last Name (LF) 511**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] require UF tomorrow
   after the OR
   - Desmopressin for platelet dysfunction to the OR.
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation:  Was poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol when
   admitted.  Switched dosing to metoprolol 75 TID with better control,
   now increased to 87.5mg Q6H.
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Hold coumadin given to OR tomorrow
   .
   #. HTN:  Controlled with metoprolol only.
   #. Leg wounds:  Wound care consulted.
   .
   #. Anemia:  Most likely secondary to ESRD.  Stools not guaiac
   positive.
   - Follow hct daily.
   - Maintain active type and screen.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   #. Anxiety:  Continue home zoloft, with ativan as needed.
   .
   FEN regular renal diet, replete lytes PRN
   Access PICC placed
   PPX heparin SC TID, contact precautions for now for ? MRSA

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including ESRD on HD, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation, multinodular goiter, and OSA, who was transferred to the ICU for evaluation of frequent intubations and concern for tracheobronchomalacia. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, likely multifactorial, and underwent formal bronchoscopy, which showed 80% stenosis of her trachea at the level of her previous tracheostomy stoma. The patient will undergo correction of the stenosis in the OR tomorrow.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on CPAP and has a SpO2 of 100%. She has a history of respiratory failure, and the bronchoscopy showed 80% stenosis of her trachea.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is poorly controlled. She has a heart rate of 103 bpm and a blood pressure of 120/78 mmHg.
* Renal: The patient has ESRD and is on HD three times a week as an outpatient.
* Hematological: The patient has anemia, which is likely secondary to ESRD.
* Infectious: The patient has a rash on her arm, which is likely related to a previous antibiotic.
* Skin: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which is likely related to her morbid obesity and ESRD.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the tracheal stenosis is not corrected.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if her heart rate is not controlled.
* Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and history of cellulitis make her prone to infection.
* Renal failure: The patient's ESRD may worsen if her kidney function is not monitored and managed properly.
* Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if her kidney function is not managed properly.
* Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if her blood pressure is not controlled.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Correction of tracheal stenosis in the OR tomorrow
* Hold coumadin tonight and restart per IP
* FFP and desmopressin to the OR tomorrow
* Volume removal with HD
* Ipratropium nebulizer treatments as needed
* Dexamethasone for inflammation
* Heli-Ox for stridor overnight
* Continue metoprolol
* Follow hct daily
* Maintain active type and screen
* EPO at HD
* Continue home zoloft, with ativan as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, multinodular goiter, and OSA who was
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for cause of frequent intubations and
   concern for tracheobronchomalacia.
   .
   #. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.  The patient
   underwent formal bronchoscopy today which showed 80% stenosis of her
   trachea at the level of her previous tracheostomy stoma.  The patient
   will go to the OR tomorrow for correction of the stenosis.
   - FFP x3 and desmopressin to the OR today
   - Held coumadin, restart per IP
   - Cultures negative, afebrile, no leukocytosis, therefore infectious
   process unlikely to be a cause of respiratory failure, no antibiotics.
   - Volume removal with HD today.
   - ipratropium nebulizer treatments as needed, hold albuterol as
   tachycardic
   - CPAP overnight as needed
   .
   #. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF as an outpatient.  Renal on board.
   - HD provided for volume removal, will have today, may require UF
   tomorrow after the OR
   - Desmopressin for platelet dysfunction to the OR.
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation:  Was poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol when
   admitted.  Switched dosing to metoprolol 75 TID with better control,
   now increased to 87.5mg Q6H.
   - Continue metoprolol, however as patient responded so well to
   diltiazem yesterday, may consider switching to PO diltiazem via a dilt
   drip if goes into RVR again.
   - Hold coumadin
   .
   #. HTN:  Controlled with metoprolol only.
   #. Leg wounds:  Wound care consulted.
   .
   #. Anemia:  Most likely secondary to ESRD.  Stools not guaiac
   positive.
   - Follow hct daily.
   - Maintain active type and screen.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   #. Anxiety:  Continue home zoloft, with ativan as needed.

Summary:

The patient, a 64-year-old female with multiple medical problems, including ESRD on HD, morbid obesity, AFib, multinodular goiter, and OSA, was transferred to the ICU for IP evaluation for frequent intubations and concern for tracheobronchomalacia. The patient underwent bronchoscopy, which showed 80% stenosis of her trachea at the level of her previous tracheostomy stoma. The patient will undergo correction of the stenosis in the OR tomorrow.

The patient's current condition includes:

* Respiratory failure likely due to OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD, goiter, and URI/bronchitis
* ESRD on HD, with HD provided for volume removal today and may require UF tomorrow after the OR
* AFib, which is poorly controlled and may require a switch to PO diltiazem via a dilt drip if the patient goes into RVR again
* HTN, controlled with metoprolol only
* Leg wounds, with wound care consulted
* Anemia, likely secondary to ESRD
* Anxiety, with continued home zoloft and ativan as needed
* Impaired skin integrity, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, chronic, fever, unknown origin, cellulitis, and renal failure, end stage.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Respiratory failure can worsen due to the 80% stenosis of the trachea, which may require emergency surgical intervention.
* ESRD can lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and infections.
* AFib can lead to further complications, such as stroke, heart failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.
* HTN can lead to further complications, such as cardiac failure, stroke, and kidney damage.
* Leg wounds can lead to further complications, such as infection, cellulitis, and osteomyelitis.
* Anemia can lead to further complications, such as fatigue, weakness, and decreased immune function.
* Impaired skin integrity can lead to further complications, such as infection, cellulitis, and sepsis.
* Fever, unknown origin, can lead to further complications, such as sepsis, multi-organ failure, and death.

The patient's current treatment plan includes:

* CPAP overnight as needed
* Ipratropium nebulizer treatments as needed, hold albuterol as tachycardic
* Volume removal with HD today
* Desmopressin for platelet dysfunction to the OR
* Metoprolol to control AFib
* Hold coumadin
* Continue home zoloft and ativan as needed
* Wound care consultation
* EPO at HD
* Follow hct daily
* Maintain active type and screen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:

* The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of bronchial stenosis, atrial fibrillation, and MRSA screen pending.
* The patient received a 500cc bolus of LR for pressure in the 80s and had HD with 3 kg UF.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 109 bpm, and blood pressure of 116/76 mmHg.
* The patient's respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula with an SpO2 of 99%.
* The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, and elevated white blood cell count, with a WBC count of 8.9.
* The patient has a history of cardiac enzymes, with a troponin-T level of 0.23.
* The patient has a PICC line and dialysis catheter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Respiratory complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and bronchial stenosis increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of cardiac enzymes suggest a risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
* Infection: The patient's MRSA screen pending and history of bronchial stenosis increase the risk of infection, particularly in the respiratory tract.
* Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 1,614 mL over the past 24 hours, which may indicate fluid overload or electrolyte imbalance.
* Renal complications: The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, which may indicate renal impairment or failure.
* Bleeding complications: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated INR, which may indicate a risk of bleeding complications.

Based on these findings, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid balance to prevent or promptly address these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5278**] is a 64F with multiple medical problems including ESRD on
   HD, morbid obesity, afib, multinodular goiter, and OSA who was
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for IP eval for cause of frequent intubations and
   concern for tracheobronchomalacia.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Likely multifactorial secondary to OSA,
   obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD,
   goiter and URI/bronchitis prior to transfer to OSH.  The patient
   underwent formal bronchoscopy today which showed 80% stenosis of her
   trachea at the level of her previous tracheostomy stoma.  Successful
   recannalization in OR yesterday.
   - Held coumadin, restart per IP
   - Cultures negative, afebrile, no leukocytosis, therefore infectious
   process unlikely to be a cause of respiratory failure, no antibiotics.
   - Volume removal with HD prn
   - ipratropium nebulizer treatments as needed, hold albuterol as
   tachycardic
   - CPAP overnight as needed
   #. ESRD on HD:  Gets HD MWF as an outpatient.  Renal on board.
   - HD provided for volume removal, will have today, may require UF
   tomorrow after the OR
   - Desmopressin for platelet dysfunction to the OR.
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation:  Was poorly controlled on [**Hospital1 7**] metoprolol when
   admitted.  Switched dosing to metoprolol 75 TID with better control,
   now increased to 87.5mg Q6H.
   - Continue metoprolol, however as patient responded so well to
   diltiazem yesterday, may consider switching to PO diltiazem via a dilt
   drip if goes into RVR again.
   - Hold coumadin
   .
   #. HTN:  Controlled with metoprolol only.
   #. Leg wounds:  Wound care consulted.
   .
   #. Anemia:  Most likely secondary to ESRD.  Stools not guaiac
   positive.
   - Follow hct daily.
   - Maintain active type and screen.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   #. Anxiety:  Continue home zoloft, with ativan as needed.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with multiple medical problems, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, morbid obesity, atrial fibrillation, multinodular goiter, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). She was transferred to the ICU for an evaluation of frequent intubations and concern for tracheobronchomalacia. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy, which showed 80% stenosis of her trachea at the level of her previous tracheostomy stoma. The patient is currently receiving hemodialysis and has a PICC line and dialysis catheter in place.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, secondary to OSA, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, CHF, volume overload from ESRD, goiter, and URI/bronchitis. The patient's tracheobronchomalacia may also contribute to her respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's MRSA screen is pending, and she has a red rash on her right arm where the BP cuff was located. She also has a history of allergies to Zosyn, which may increase her risk of infection.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke.
4. Renal complications: The patient has ESRD on hemodialysis, which may increase her risk of renal complications such as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to ESRD, and she may require blood transfusions to manage her anemia.
6. Leg wounds: The patient has leg wounds that are being treated with wound care, and she may be at risk for further complications such as infection and delayed healing.
7. Anxiety: The patient has a history of anxiety, and she may be at risk for further complications such as panic attacks and anxiety disorders.

Overall, the patient is at risk for a variety of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."
