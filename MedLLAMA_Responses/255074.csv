You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis, was admitted to the ICU with acute pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure. She was initially treated with non-invasive ventilation and received nitro drip to maintain systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 130 mmHg and diuresis with Lasix. The patient was also started on hydralazine due to her maxed-out nitro drip response.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.2°C (99°F)
* Heart rate: 83 bpm (normal range: 65-90 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 162/81 mmHg (normal range: 101/65-169/122 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (normal range: 18-39 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 95%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: No acute distress
* Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds, no murmurs
* Respiratory/chest: Crackles in the lungs
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds present
* Extremities: Right lower extremity edema 1+, left lower extremity edema 1+
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Attentive, responds to verbal commands, but movement and tone are not assessed

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.1 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 32.7%
* Platelet count: 417 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.07 ng/mL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 26 mg/dL
* Glucose: 126 mg/dL

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Heart failure (diastolic and acute)
* Pulmonary edema
* Hypoxia
* Acute kidney injury (suspected)
* Rhabdomyolysis (prior history)

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Progressive heart failure
* Worsening pulmonary edema
* Increased risk of respiratory failure
* Acute kidney injury
* Electrolyte imbalances
* Infection
* Poor wound healing

Based on the patient's condition and medical history, the plan of care includes:

* Diuresis therapy with IV Furosemide 80mg
* Weaning off CPAP
* Monitoring of clinic examination, strict intake and output, and daily weights
* Maintenance of strict electrolyte monitoring and replacement
* Restarting Ativan daily for agitation
* Trending creatinine levels on diuresis therapy
* Monitoring urine output and electrolyte levels
* No continuation of statin therapy due to prior history of rhabdomyolysis
* Prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin for DVT and stress ulcer prevention

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes type II, and right subclavian stenosis, who was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by stroke. She is currently in the ICU due to acute pulmonary edema and heart failure. She was started on non-invasive ventilation and has been experiencing agitation, requiring restraints and sedation. Her medical history includes hypertension, diabetes, and a recent hospitalization for hypertension complicated by stroke.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 162/81 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes non-invasive ventilation with a bipap mask, with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Her laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, likely due to poor forward flow.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Worsening of acute pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema is likely to worsen if her diuresis therapy is not optimized, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Development of acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of acute on chronic renal failure make her susceptible to developing acute kidney injury, which can worsen her condition.
3. Agitation and delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium can lead to worsening of her condition, increased risk of falls, and decreased ability to cooperate with medical treatment.
4. Hypotension: The patient's use of nitro drip and hydralazine may lead to hypotension, which can worsen her condition and increase the risk of organ failure.
5. Infection: The patient's history of recent hospitalization and current ICU stay make her susceptible to developing infections, which can worsen her condition and increase the risk of mortality.
6. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's history of rhabdomyolysis and statin use make her susceptible to developing rhabdomyolysis again, which can worsen her condition and increase the risk of organ failure.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's history of electrolyte imbalance and use of diuretics make her susceptible to developing electrolyte imbalance, which can worsen her condition and increase the risk of organ failure."

   24 Hour Events:
   - ECG showed QTC 413 ms
   - Renal: MRA for RAS should be ordered in a NON-contrast protocol (call

   management and should be ordered when patient can tolerate
   - Dialysis: brought up question of dialysis for management of fluid
   overload in future, renal will comment in next note
   - Initially doing well of cpap but then dessated to 88% and needed unit
   cpap initially at FiO2 of 100% then weaned back to facemask/nasal
   cannula combo
   - Looked through all of old hospital records (both omr and scanned
   records) and can't find any strong reason to use geodon and pharmacy is
   NOT happy about it. there is a neuro consult which says don't use
   haldol because increased risk of EPS and instead use geodon OR zyprexa.
   will switch pt to zyprexa because this is way easier to deal with.
   - Wild overnight. gave an extra dose of 2.5 zyprexa, but she wouldn't
   take it. gave 10 geodon IM instead.
   - Psych consulted yesterday but did not come by today.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 77 yof with h/o resistant htn, DM II, Right subclavian
   stenosis s/p recent hospitalization for HTN who presented to the [**Hospital1 1**]
   ED w/ SOB, in fluid overload state with hypertension, progressive renal
   failure (rising Cr) and continued agitation
   24 Hour Events:
   - ECG showed QTC 413 ms
   - Renal: MRA for RAS should be ordered in a NON-contrast protocol (call
   radiology - ? IR procedure)- not emergent study but would change
   management and should be ordered when patient can tolerate
   - Dialysis: brought up question of dialysis for management of fluid
   overload in future, renal will comment in next note
   - Initially doing well of cpap but then dessated to 88% and needed unit
   cpap initially at FiO2 of 100% then weaned back to facemask/nasal
   cannula combo
   - Looked through all of old hospital records (both omr and scanned
   records) and can't find any strong reason to use geodon and pharmacy is
   NOT happy about it. there is a neuro consult which says don't use
   haldol because increased risk of EPS and instead use geodon OR zyprexa.
   will switch pt to zyprexa because this is way easier to deal with.
   - Wild overnight. gave an extra dose of 2.5 zyprexa, but she wouldn't
   take it. gave 10 geodon IM instead.
   - Psych consulted yesterday but did not come by today.
   - Today's ekg shows normal qt, will check again tomorrow

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. She was recently hospitalized for hypertension and presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath, fluid overload state, hypertension, progressive renal failure, and agitation. She was admitted to the ICU and received various treatments, including CPAP, diuretics, and vasodilators. Her current condition is characterized by hypoxia, CHF, and acute on chronic renal failure. She is also experiencing agitation, delirium, and hypertension, which is exacerbated by her agitation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and fluid overload state increase her risk of developing respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's CHF, hypertension, and acute on chronic renal failure increase her risk of developing cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure and fluid overload state increase her risk of developing further renal failure.
4. Infection: The patient's immobility and fluid overload state increase her risk of developing infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
5. Delirium and agitation: The patient's delirium and agitation increase her risk of developing further complications, such as falls, pressure ulcers, or respiratory failure.
6. Stroke: The patient's history of stroke and hypertension increase her risk of developing further strokes.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and CHF increase her risk of developing further cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's fluid overload state and immobility increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid overload state and diuretic use increase her risk of developing electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia or hyperkalemia.
10. Bleeding complications: The patient's use of anticoagulants and her fluid overload state increase her risk of developing bleeding complications, such as hematuria or gastrointestinal bleeding."

   failure (rising Cr) and continued agitation
   24 Hour Events:
   - ECG showed QTC 413 ms
   - Renal: MRA for RAS should be ordered in a NON-contrast protocol (call
   radiology - ? IR procedure)- not emergent study but would change
   management and should be ordered when patient can tolerate
   - Dialysis: brought up question of dialysis for management of fluid
   overload in future, renal will comment in next note
   - Initially doing well of cpap but then dessated to 88% and needed unit
   cpap initially at FiO2 of 100% then weaned back to facemask/nasal
   cannula combo
   - Looked through all of old hospital records (both omr and scanned
   records) and can't find any strong reason to use geodon and pharmacy is
   NOT happy about it. there is a neuro consult which says don't use
   haldol because increased risk of EPS and instead use geodon OR zyprexa.
   will switch pt to zyprexa because this is way easier to deal with.
   - Wild overnight. gave an extra dose of 2.5 zyprexa, but she wouldn't
   take it. gave 10 geodon IM instead.
   - Psych consulted yesterday but did not come by today.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 y.o. Female with history of resistant HTN, DM II, right
   subclavian stenosis s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by
   stroke p/w SOB.
   ##. Hypoxia: continues to have desaturations requiring CPAP.  Etiology
   [**12-24**] to combination of CHF and impaired renal function resulting in
   fluid overload state.  Lasix discontinued for worsening renal function,
   now with Cr of 4.1.  Patient in continued respiratory distress.
   - consider elective endotracheal intubation for improved ventilation
   and sedation for MRA
   - continue to optimize afterload reduction for diastolic heart failure
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis for resistant
   effusions
   - consider dialysis for fluid overload state with failing renal
   function
   ##. CHF: patient pressures generally < 130/90 unless agitated, now
   managed with maxed out Isosorbide, hydralazine, ISMN, clonidine patch,
   amlodipine , metoprolol, hydralazine
   - continue supportive care
   - maintain strict I&Os
   - consider addition of lobetalol instead of metoprolol for focused
   vasculature target rather than nodal target
   - daily weights
   - low Na diet
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium
   - continue above regimen with addition of geodon and ativan for
   agitation
   - consider non-contrast MRA to r/o RAS when patient can tolerate
   procedure
   ##. Agitation: patient with continued delirium and agitation,
   exacerbating her hypertension and respiratory status
   - continue home dose of ativan
   - continue geodon IM as patient will not tolerate Zyprexia
   - will defer psychiatric and geriatric consultation pending
   endotracheal intubation
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure: Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admissionm currently elevated at
   4.1.likely due to substantial pre-renal component as patient may have
   IV depletion.
   - will hold diuresis for elevated Cr, do not want to push into acute
   renal failure
   - considering non-contrast MRA to r/o MRA in setting of resistant
   hypertension once sedated and intubated
   - consider hemodialysis for fluid overload state
 will follow up renal
   recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. She was admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath, fluid overload, and progressive renal failure. The patient's condition is complicated by hypertension, agitation, and delirium, which exacerbates her respiratory status. She is currently receiving CPAP and oxygen therapy, and her vital signs are stable. However, her creatinine level is elevated at 4.1 mg/dL, and she is at risk of acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is at risk of developing acute renal failure if her fluid overload is not managed effectively.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and fluid overload. She may require endotracheal intubation to improve ventilation and oxygenation.
3. Cardiac Failure: The patient's cardiac function is compromised due to her hypertension and fluid overload. She may require further management of her cardiac condition, including diuretics and vasodilators.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection due to her indwelling catheter and her compromised immune system.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium is exacerbating her agitation and hypertension. She may require further management of her delirium, including sedation and antipsychotic medication.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and she may require further management to prevent electrolyte imbalance.
7. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and she may require further management to prevent hemodynamic instability.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to manage the patient's fluid overload with diuretics and vasodilators.
2. Consider endotracheal intubation to improve ventilation and oxygenation.
3. Manage the patient's delirium with sedation and antipsychotic medication.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and manage any imbalances.
5. Consider further management of the patient's cardiac condition, including diuretics and vasodilators.
6. Monitor the patient's renal function and consider further management to prevent acute renal failure.
7. Consider further management of the patient's hypertension, including non-contrast MRA to rule out renal artery stenosis."

   - continue supportive care
   - maintain strict I&Os
   - attempt to keep SBPs in 150
s to 160
s, currently somewhat
   bradycardic so will back off on TID metoprolol.   Will give 5mg IV
   metoprolol Q6H. Nitro gtt as needed for goals.
   - daily weights
   - low Na diet
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis, who was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by stroke and presented with symptoms of shortness of breath.

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure, which is attributed to a combination of chronic heart failure and impaired renal function leading to fluid overload. The patient's creatinine level has increased to 4.4 mg/dL, and she is anuric.

The patient's cardiac status is complicated by diastolic heart failure, and she is being managed with rate control and afterload reduction medications. She has a history of resistant hypertension and is being treated with clonidine patch, amlodipine, and metoprolol.

The patient's neurological status is altered due to sedation, and she is at risk for delirium. She has a history of stroke and is at risk for increased intracranial pressure.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is at risk for further deterioration.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status is complicated by diastolic heart failure, and she is at risk for further cardiac decompensation.
3. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 4.4 mg/dL, and she is anuric. She is at risk for further renal deterioration and may require dialysis.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of MRSA and is at risk for further infection.
5. Delirium: The patient's neurological status is altered due to sedation, and she is at risk for delirium.
6. Increased intracranial pressure: The patient has a history of stroke and is at risk for increased intracranial pressure.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, and she is at risk for further imbalance.
8. Blood pressure control: The patient's blood pressure is labile, and she is at risk for further hypertension or hypotension.

In summary, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further deterioration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis, who was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by stroke and presented with shortness of breath. She was intubated yesterday for sedation during an MRA procedure and for tiring on CPAP. She has been experiencing oliguria/anuria, pain control issues, altered mental status, pulmonary edema, and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.9°F)
* Heart rate: 58 bpm (53-76 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 149/42 mmHg (74-166/57 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute (13-25 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 6 mmHg (5-14 mmHg)

The patient has been receiving various medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, lorazepam, propofol, and heparin sodium, as well as insulin and IV fluids.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 11.6 (10.2-8.1)
* Hematocrit: 28.3 (27.2-26.5)
* Platelet count: 343 (312-320)
* Creatinine: 4.4 mg/dL (3.9-4.1)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 24 mg/dL (26-25)
* Glucose: 138 mg/dL (126-124)

The patient has undergone various imaging studies, including a chest radiograph, which shows bilateral parenchymal opacities, marked cardiomegaly, retrocardiac atelectasis, and moderate right pleural effusion.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Optimization of rate control and afterload reduction for diastolic heart failure
* Consideration of therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis for resistant effusions
* Consideration of dialysis for fluid overload state with failing renal function
* Rate control and afterload reduction for hypertension
* Supportive care for acute pain and chronic pain
* Maintenance of strict I&Os and daily weights
* Low sodium diet
* Non-contrast MRA to rule out renal artery stenosis
* Hemodialysis for fluid overload state and anuria

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Acute renal failure due to continued oliguria/anuria and IVF depletion
* Pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status
* Sepsis and septic shock due to potential infections
* Cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest due to electrolyte imbalances and cardiac disease
* Gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation due to stress ulcer disease
* Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and hypercoagulability
* Worsening of hypertension and cardiac disease due to continued fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the plan of care accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a complex medical history, including resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and a recent hospitalization for hypertension complicated by stroke. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple medical issues.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS)
* Oliguria/anuria
* Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)
* Altered mental status (not delirium)
* Pulmonary edema

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.9°F)
* Heart rate: 61 bpm (52-93 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 166/46 mmHg (85/37-272/103 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute (13-29 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results are:

* White blood cell count: 8.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 263 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 4.8 mg/dL
* Sodium: 138 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.8 mmol/L
* Chloride: 103 mmol/L
* Bicarbonate: 25 mmol/L
* Glucose: 124 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies are:

* Renal MRI: No evidence of significant renal artery stenosis bilaterally. Multiple renal cysts were noted, with two lesions in the left kidney that may represent hemorrhagic cysts.
* CT head: No evidence of intracranial bleed.

The patient's medical plan is as follows:

* Continue to optimize rate control/afterload reduction for diastolic heart failure
* Try pressure support ventilation (PSV) today and plan for extubation tomorrow
* Consider therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis for resistant effusions
* Consider dialysis for fluid overload state with falling renal function
* Continue supportive care for chronic heart failure
* Maintain strict intake and output (I&O) monitoring
* Attempt to keep systolic blood pressures between 150-160 mmHg
* Restart beta blocker if needed for blood pressure control
* Monitor for signs of fluid overload and adjust treatment accordingly

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of respiratory failure
* Further decline in renal function
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Increased risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Potential for cardiac arrhythmias or worsening of heart failure
* Risk of electrolyte imbalances or acid-base disturbances
* Potential for further cognitive decline or altered mental status

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   This is a 77 y.o. Female with history of resistant HTN, DM II, right
   subclavian stenosis s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by
   stroke p/w SOB.
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: s/p intubation yesterday for sedation
   for MRA and for tiring on CPAP.  Hypoxic etiology [**12-24**] to combination of
   CHF and impaired renal function resulting in fluid overload state
   - continue to optimize rate control/afterload reduction for diastolic
   heart failure
   - consider therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis for resistant
   effusions
   - consider dialysis for fluid overload state with falling renal
   function
   ##. CHF: patient off nitro drip now that sedated, now managed with
   clonidine patch, amlodipine , metoprolol; off isosorbide, hydralazine
   - rate control/afterload reduction
   - continue supportive care
   - maintain strict I&Os
   - attempt to keep SBPs in 150
s to 160
s, brady yesterday. metoprolol
   dc'ed. if need to restart bblocker for bp control, could try labetolol
   or carvedilol rather than lopressor so get more bp control for the drop
   in HR.
   - daily weights
   - low Na diet
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; better now that sedated
   -rate control and afterload reduction-- clonidine patch, amlodipine ,
   off isosorbide, hydralazine; nitro drip
   ##. Agitation: off meds now, as sedated
   - will defer psychiatric and geriatric consultation until extubated
   -off fentanyl drip and midaz drip. Very agitated though. will restart
   fent drip and use midaz in boluses
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure: Now anuric. Pt's prior baseline
   Creatinine noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated
   at 4.8.
   -per wet read of MRA, no RAS
   -may be slowly heading towards HD
   -gave lasix yesterday c good effect per renal, however, Cr did continue
   to rise
   -greatly appreciate renal recs
   .
   ## Bradycardia: DDx excessive beta blockade with meds vs. sedation vs.
   increased ICP (note patient has HTN and old strokes)
   -CT head without contrast to evaluate for ICH reassuring
   -off fentanyl drip and midaz drip. Very agitated though. will restart

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and a recent hospitalization for hypertension complicated by stroke. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, and altered mental status.

Current Vital Signs:

* Temperature: 37.7°C (99.9°F)
* Heart Rate: 61 bpm (52-93 bpm)
* Blood Pressure: 166/46 mmHg (85-272/103-172 mmHg)
* Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute (13-29 breaths per minute)
* SpO2: 100%

Lab Results:

* White Blood Cell Count: 8.1-7.4 K/μL
* Hematocrit: 26.5-25.2%
* Platelet Count: 320-263 K/μL
* Creatinine: 4.8 mg/dL (elevated)
* Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 65 mg/dL
* Sodium: 138 mEq/L
* Potassium: 3.8 mEq/L
* Calcium: 9.0 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 5.7 mg/dL
* Lactic Acid: 1.1 mmol/L

Imaging Studies:

* CT Head: No evidence of intracranial bleeding
* Renal MRI: No evidence of significant renal artery stenosis bilaterally, but multiple renal cysts were noted, including two lesions in the left kidney that may represent hemorrhagic cysts.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): Continue to optimize rate control and afterload reduction for diastolic heart failure.
2. Oliguria/Anuria: Consider therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis for resistant effusions and dialysis for fluid overload state with falling renal function.
3. Heart Failure, Diastolic, Acute: Continue to manage with clonidine patch, amlodipine, and metoprolol, and consider therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis.
4. Hypertension: Rate control and afterload reduction with clonidine patch, amlodipine, and off isosorbide, hydralazine.
5. Agitation: Deferring psychiatric and geriatric consultation until extubated, and restarting fentanyl drip and using midazolam in boluses.
6. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Consider hemodialysis, and continue to monitor creatinine levels.
7. Bradycardia: Consider excessive beta blockade with medications, sedation, or increased intracranial pressure, and restarting fentanyl drip and using midazolam in boluses.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: Continued hypoxic respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Cardiac Complications: Heart failure, diastolic, acute, may lead to further cardiac decompensation, including cardiac arrest.
3. Renal Failure: Acute on chronic renal failure may progress to end-stage renal disease, requiring hemodialysis.
4. Infections: The patient's immunocompromised state may increase the risk of infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia.
5. Bleeding: The patient's history of hypertension and old strokes may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels may continue to fluctuate, leading to potential complications such as arrhythmias or muscle weakness.
7. Worsening Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to increased agitation, confusion, or even coma.

Based on the patient's condition and potential medical complications, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, type II diabetes, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted with acute onset dyspnea and fluid overload state in setting of CKD and worsening renal function.

The patient was intubated for respiratory support due to frequent desaturations with CPAP. He was started on autodiuresis without lasix, and his creatinine level is stable at 4.7. He is also receiving Haldol 0.5 mg IV PRN for agitation, with ECG monitoring for QT interval.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 167/48 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 11 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 97%. His cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.4, hemoglobin of 7.8 g/dL, platelet count of 263, and creatinine level of 4.7 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.7 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging studies show a negative computed tomography (CT) head scan and a negative renal ultrasound. His microbiology results show a negative blood culture and a negative sputum culture.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and is planned for extubation. He will continue to receive afterload reduction for fluid overload state in setting of CKD and known diastolic heart failure.
* CHF: The patient is currently off nitro drip and is being treated with clonodine patch and amlodipine. His blood pressure medications will be re-adjusted as his physiology changes after extubation.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 7.8 g/dL, and his platelet count is 263. He is being monitored for bleeding and will receive PRBC transfusions as needed.
* HTN: The patient has a history of resistant hypertension and is being treated with afterload reduction.
* Agitation: The patient is being treated with Haldol 0.5 mg IV PRN for agitation, with ECG monitoring for QT interval.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure can worsen if not properly managed.
* Cardiac failure: The patient's CHF can worsen if not properly managed.
* Renal failure: The patient's CKD can worsen if not properly managed.
* Bleeding: The patient's anemia and platelet count can increase the risk of bleeding.
* Infection: The patient's compromised immune system can increase the risk of infection.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and platelet count can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his various medical conditions to prevent complications and improve his outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted with acute onset dyspnea and was found to be in a fluid overload state. He was intubated for respiratory support due to frequent desaturations with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The patient has been experiencing agitation and was started on haloperidol (Haldol) for sedation. He has been autodiuresing without lasix and has a stable creatinine level of 4.7 mg/dL. The patient's blood pressure is labile and requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is marginal, and he is at risk of developing further respiratory failure.
2. Fluid overload: The patient is in a fluid overload state, which can lead to further complications such as cardiac failure, respiratory failure, and increased risk of infection.
3. Chronic kidney disease: The patient's CKD is worsening, and he is at risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is labile and requires close monitoring to prevent further complications such as cardiac failure, stroke, or hypertensive crisis.
5. Agitation: The patient's agitation is a concern, and he is at risk of developing further complications such as delirium, aggression, or self-harm.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his fluid overload state, and close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect any potential infections early.
7. Cardiac failure: The patient's fluid overload state and worsening CKD increase his risk of developing cardiac failure, which can lead to further complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or death.
8. Renal failure: The patient's CKD is worsening, and he is at risk of developing AKI or ESRD, which can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and death.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor his vital signs, laboratory results, and fluid status to prevent further complications. The patient's treatment plan should be adjusted accordingly to address his fluid overload state, CKD, hypertension, agitation, and risk of infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 negative.
   Patient stable on PSV with most recent RSBI of  21.
   - plan for extubation
   - continue afterload reduction for fluid overload state in setting of
   CKD and known diastolic HF
 titrate up BB if HTN
   - consider long term HD for CKD and Cr of 4.7
   ##. CHF: patient currently off nitro drip, treated with clonodine
   patch, amlodipine
   - re-adjust BP medications as physiology will likely change s/p
   extubation
 potentially add lobetalol, and hydralazine
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
   ## Anemia: HCT continues to [**2126**]6.5

   falling all cell lines (WBC
s and platelets), however NG aspirate
   appeared darker.
   - guiac stool and NG aspirate
   - continue to trend with q hr HCT
   - consider PRBC transfusion for falling HCT
   - consider adding IV PPI for possible GIB
   - consult GI if guiac +
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above
   ##. Agitation:
   - geriatric and psychiatric consultation
   - continue Haldol 0.5 mg IV PRN agitation with ECG monitoring
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated and stable
   at 4.8 s/p initial Lasix diuresis now autodiuresis. MRA performed
   confirming no RAS.
   - patient continues to auto-diurese in setting of stable Cr
   - hold Lasix for now

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted with acute onset dyspnea and fluid overload, which was managed with intubation and respiratory support.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 37.7°C, Heart rate 75 bpm, Blood pressure 167/48 mmHg, Respiratory rate 11 breaths per minute, SpO2 97%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Central venous pressure (CVP) 8 mmHg, Mean arterial pressure (MAP) 123 mmHg.
* Fluid balance: Total input 190 mL, Total output 1,396 mL, Balance -1,206 mL.
* Respiratory support: Endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 40%.
* Lab results: Hemoglobin 7.8 g/dL, Platelet count 263 K/uL, Creatinine 4.7 mg/dL, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 26 mEq/L, Sodium 139 mEq/L, Potassium 3.6 mEq/L, Calcium 9.1 mg/dL, Magnesium 2.3 mg/dL, Phosphorus 6.7 mg/dL.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and receiving respiratory support, and the plan is to extubate him once his condition improves.
* Chronic kidney disease: The patient's creatinine level is 4.7 mg/dL, and he is experiencing fluid overload. Long-term hemodialysis may be necessary to manage his CKD.
* Heart failure: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure, and his blood pressure is being managed with afterload reduction.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 7.8 g/dL, and his hematocrit is 25.2%. He is at risk for bleeding due to his anemia and platelet dysfunction.
* Hypertension: The patient has a history of resistant hypertension, and his blood pressure is being managed with afterload reduction.
* Agitation: The patient is receiving haloperidol for agitation, and ECG monitoring is being performed to monitor for QT interval prolongation.
* Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is experiencing fluid overload. He is at risk for further kidney damage due to his acute kidney injury.

The patient's potential complications include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to his chronic kidney disease and fluid overload.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient is at risk for cardiac arrest due to his heart failure and electrolyte imbalance.
* Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to his anemia and platelet dysfunction.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his indwelling catheters and respiratory support.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: patient currently intubated for
   marginal respiratory status on CPAP and for MRA to r/o RAS
 negative.
   - continue to optimize rate control/afterload reduction for diastolic
   heart failure
   -try psv today, plan for extubation tomorrow
   - could also consider therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis for
   resistant effusions
   - consider dialysis for fluid overload state with falling renal
   function
   ##. CHF: patient off nitro drip now that sedated, now managed with
   clonidine patch, amlodipine , metoprolol; off isosorbide, hydralazine
   - rate control/afterload reduction
   - continue supportive care
   - maintain strict I&Os
   - attempt to keep SBPs in 150
s to 160
s, brady yesterday. metoprolol
   dc'ed. if need to restart bblocker for bp control, could try labetolol
   or carvedilol rather than lopressor so get more bp control for the drop
   in HR.
   - daily weights
   - low Na diet
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; better now that sedated
   -rate control and afterload reduction-- clonidine patch, amlodipine ,
   off isosorbide, hydralazine; nitro drip
   ##. Agitation: off meds now, as sedated
   - will defer psychiatric and geriatric consultation until extubated
   -off fentanyl drip and midaz drip. Very agitated though. will continue
   fent and midaz boluses but change to q2h.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure: Now anuric. Pt's prior baseline
   Creatinine noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated
   at 4.8.
   -per wet read of MRA, no RAS
   -may be slowly heading towards HD
   -gave lasix yesterday c good effect per renal, however, Cr did continue
   to rise
   -greatly appreciate renal recs
   -pt seems to be autodiuresing this am, will hold off on more lasix but
   plan for TBB of -1Liter, use lasix boluses prn (120IV)
   .
   ## Bradycardia: DDx excessive beta blockade with meds vs. sedation vs.
   increased ICP (note patient has HTN and old strokes)
   -CT head without contrast to evaluate for ICH reassuring
   -off fentanyl drip and midaz drip. Very agitated though. will restart
   fent drip and use midaz in boluses
   -will restart bblocker as no bradycardia since yesterday morning

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   dc'ed. if need to restart bblocker for bp control, could try labetolol
   or carvedilol rather than lopressor so get more bp control for the drop
   in HR.
   - daily weights
   - low Na diet
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile

   - will defer psychiatric and geriatric consultation until extubated
   -off fentanyl drip and midaz drip. Very agitated though. will continue
   fent and midaz boluses but change to q2h.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure: Now anuric. Pt's prior baseline
   Creatinine noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated
   at 4.8.
   -per wet read of MRA, no RAS
   -may be slowly heading towards HD
   -gave lasix yesterday c good effect per renal, however, Cr did continue
   to rise

Based on the patient's progress note, the following are the key findings and potential medical complications:

1. Patient's condition:
	* The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, DM-II, right subclavian stenosis, and CKD, admitted with acute onset dyspnea and fluid overload.
	* He is currently intubated for respiratory support and has been treated with various medications, including lasix, fentanyl, and midazolam.
2. Respiratory status:
	* The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with a respiratory rate of 11 inspirations per minute and a SpO2 of 97%.
	* He has been treated with CPAP and PSV, and his respiratory support is being weaned.
3. Cardiac status:
	* The patient has a history of resistant hypertension and is currently being treated with medications to control his blood pressure.
	* He has a history of old strokes and is at risk for bradycardia due to excessive beta blockade or sedation.
4. Renal status:
	* The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level of 4.8 mg/dL.
	* He is anuric and has been treated with lasix, but his creatinine level continues to rise.
5. Fluid status:
	* The patient is in a fluid overload state, with a total fluid intake of 190 mL and a total fluid output of 1,396 mL.
6. Neurological status:
	* The patient is sedated and has been treated with fentanyl and midazolam.
	* He is at risk for increased intracranial pressure due to his fluid overload and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is at risk for further respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of old strokes and resistant hypertension puts him at risk for cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is worsening, and he is at risk for further renal failure.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid overload state is a risk factor for further complications, such as cardiac failure, respiratory failure, and increased intracranial pressure.
5. Increased intracranial pressure: The patient's fluid overload and respiratory failure put him at risk for increased intracranial pressure, which could lead to cerebral edema and herniation.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his indwelling lines and tubes, and his immunocompromised state.

Based on the patient's condition and potential medical complications, the following interventions should be considered:

1. Continue to optimize the patient's respiratory support and fluid management to prevent further complications.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust his medication regimen as necessary to prevent cardiac arrest.
3. Continue to treat the patient's acute on chronic renal failure with lasix and other medications as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and adjust his sedation regimen as necessary to prevent increased intracranial pressure.
5. Consider therapeutic thoracentesis with pleurodesis to manage the patient's fluid overload.
6. Consider dialysis for the patient's fluid overload state and worsening renal function."

   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic heart failure, exacerbated by high afterload and
   worsening renal function.    Respiratory status improved with increased
   afterload reduction which improved diuresis.  She was extubated
   yesterday.   Respiratory status stable on face mask and nasal cannula.
   CXR shows pulm edema.
   Holding diuresis given renal failure.
   - repeat CXR
   - optimize cardiac output and renal perfusion
   - cardiology consulted
   .
   ##. CHF:  on Labetolol, Amlodippine, clonidine, hydralazine.  NG drip
   off.   Improving end organ perfusion shows some improvement as
   evidenced by improvement in renal function.    She has history of MR,
   which is evident on exam and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does
   not support this), and may be a contributing factor to her worsening
   pulmonary edema.
   - Pt has isolated systolic hypertension, which is improving, but
   medically optimizing hypertension and cardiac output could benefit her
   renal function and prolong hemodialysis
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
   ## Anemia: HCT continues to [**2125**]6.5
 25.2
 23.8 in the setting of
   falling all cell lines (WBC
s and platelets). Today Hct is 24.3,
   stable.
   - NG aspirate guaic negative
   - no BM
 guaic stool, bowel regimen to facilitate this test.
   - continue to trend with q hr HCT
   - consider PRBC transfusion for falling HCT this evening
   - IV PPI for possible GIB
   - consult GI if guiac +
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above
   ##. Agitation:
   - geriatric and psychiatric consultation
   - continue Haldol 0.5 po standing,  with ECG monitoring for QT
   prolongation
   - d/c fentanyl, should be used for agitation.
   - may  need to uptitrate haldol with discontinuation of fentanyl
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.
   Creatinine fell from 4.7 to 4.2 today.  She is autodiuresing with UOP
   of 1200cc.   Anticipate renal function should continue to improve with
   improved renal perfusion.   MRA performed confirming no RAS.
   - patient continues to auto-diurese in setting of  improving
   - hold Lasix for now
   - consider long term HD for ultimate fluid control

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic heart failure, exacerbated by high afterload and
   worsening renal function.    Respiratory status improved with increased
   afterload reduction which improved diuresis.  She was extubated
   yesterday.   Respiratory status stable on face mask and nasal cannula.
   CXR shows pulm edema.
   Holding diuresis given renal failure.
   - repeat CXR
   - optimize cardiac output and renal perfusion
   - cardiology consulted
   .
   ##. CHF:  on Labetolol, Amlodippine, clonidine, hydralazine.  NG drip
   off.   Improving end organ perfusion shows some improvement as
   evidenced by improvement in renal function.    She has history of MR,
   which is evident on exam and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does
   not support this), and may be a contributing factor to her worsening
   pulmonary edema.
   - Pt has isolated systolic hypertension, which is improving, but
   medically optimizing hypertension and cardiac output could benefit her
   renal function and prolong hemodialysis
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
   ## Anemia: HCT continues to [**2125**]6.5
 25.2
 23.8 in the setting of
   falling all cell lines (WBC
s and platelets). Today Hct is 24.3,
   stable.
   - NG aspirate guaic negative
   - no BM
 guaic stool, bowel regimen to facilitate this test.
   - continue to trend with q hr HCT
   - consider PRBC transfusion for falling HCT this evening
   - IV PPI for possible GIB
   - consult GI if guiac +
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above
   ##. Agitation:
   - geriatric and psychiatric consultation
   - continue Haldol 0.5 po standing,  with ECG monitoring for QT
   prolongation
   - d/c fentanyl, should be used for agitation.
   - may  need to uptitrate haldol with discontinuation of fentanyl
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.
   Creatinine fell from 4.7 to 4.2 today.  She is autodiuresing with UOP
   of 1200cc.   Anticipate renal function should continue to improve with
   improved renal perfusion.   MRA performed confirming no RAS.
   - patient continues to auto-diurese in setting of  improving
   - hold Lasix for now
   - consider long term HD for ultimate fluid control

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was admitted with acute onset dyspnea and fluid overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure. The patient was intubated for respiratory support due to frequent desaturations with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

The patient's current condition is stable, with improved respiratory status after extubation and optimization of cardiac output and renal perfusion. However, she still requires close monitoring and management of her condition.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she may still experience respiratory failure due to underlying chronic heart failure and pulmonary edema.
2. Cardiac failure: The patient has a history of heart failure, and her condition may worsen due to underlying cardiac disease.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving, but she may still experience renal failure due to underlying CKD and acute on chronic renal failure.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is stable, but she may still experience anemia due to underlying CKD and falling all cell lines (WBC, platelets, and red blood cells).
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is improving, but she may still experience hypertension due to underlying resistant hypertension and labile pressures.
6. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, which may worsen due to underlying delirium and psychiatric conditions.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal (GI) status is stable, but she may still experience GI bleeding due to underlying GI conditions and medications.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to her underlying medical conditions and immobility.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to her underlying respiratory condition and prolonged intubation.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, I recommend the following:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory, cardiac, and renal status.
2. Optimize cardiac output and renal perfusion to improve the patient's overall condition.
3. Manage the patient's hypertension and anemia with appropriate medications and therapies.
4. Monitor the patient's GI status and consider prophylactic antibiotics to prevent GI bleeding.
5. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent DVT and VAP.
6. Consult with cardiology and GI services to optimize the patient's care and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted with acute onset dyspnea, fluid overload, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient was intubated for respiratory support due to frequent desaturations with CPAP. He was extubated and is currently receiving oxygen therapy. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, unknown, and furosemide, with a rash. He is receiving multiple medications, including phosphate binder, aldactone, hydralazine, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, with frequent desaturations and the need for intubation and oxygen therapy. Prolonged respiratory failure can lead to further complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and cardiac arrest.
2. Oliguria/Anuria: The patient's renal function is compromised, with oliguria/anuria noted. This can lead to further fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and potential acute kidney injury.
3. Pain Control: The patient has acute and chronic pain, which may require ongoing management to prevent further complications, such as pain-induced respiratory depression or increased risk of falls.
4. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of heart failure, which may be exacerbated by fluid overload and acute kidney injury. This can lead to further cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be related to medication, electrolyte imbalances, or other underlying medical conditions. This can lead to further complications, such as falls, delirium, and increased risk of hospital-acquired infections.
6. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has pulmonary edema, which can lead to further respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure and cardiac arrest.
7. DVT/PE: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to immobility and underlying medical conditions.
8. VAP: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia due to prolonged intubation and respiratory therapy.
9. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and neurologic dysfunction.
10. Infection: The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired infections due to immobility, underlying medical conditions, and prolonged hospital stay.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his underlying medical conditions to prevent further complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic heart failure, exacerbated by high afterload and
   worsening renal function.   Respiratory status improved with increased
   afterload reduction which improved diuresis.  She was extubated
   yesterday.  Respiratory status stable on
   ##. CHF:  on Labetolol, Amlodippine, clonidine, hydralazine.  NG drip
   off.   Improving end organ perfusion as evidenced by improvement in
   renal function.
   - re-adjust BP medications, titrate to improve afterload reduction
   potentially add lobetalol, and hydralazine
   - maintain strict I/O

   appeared darker.  Today Hct is 24.3, stable.
   - guiac stool and NG aspirate
   - continue to trend with q hr HCT
   - consider PRBC transfusion for falling HCT
   - consider adding IV PPI for possible GIB

   - continue Haldol 0.5 po standing,  with ECG monitoring for QT
   prolongation
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.
   Creatinine fell from 4.7 to 4.2 today.  She is autodiuresing with UOP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was admitted with acute onset dyspnea and was found to be in fluid overload. She was intubated for respiratory support due to frequent desaturations with CPAP. The patient was extubated yesterday and is currently on oxygen therapy. Her respiratory status is stable.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: believed to be secondary to pulmonary edema and chronic heart failure.
2. CHF: on multiple medications, including labetalol, amlodipine, clonidine, and hydralazine. Her BP is being re-adjusted to improve afterload reduction.
3. Anemia: her HCT is stable at 24.3, but she may require PRBC transfusion for falling HCT.
4. HTN: the patient has a history of resistant hypertension, with labile pressures ranging from 120 to 180 systolic.
5. Agitation: the patient is receiving Haldol for sedation and is being monitored for QT prolongation.
6. Acute on chronic renal failure: the patient's creatinine is elevated, but it fell from 4.7 to 4.2 today. She is autodiuresing with a urine output of 1200cc.
7. Fluid overload: the patient is at risk for fluid overload, and her fluid status is being closely monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pneumonia: the patient is at risk for developing pneumonia due to her respiratory failure and fluid overload.
2. Sepsis: the patient is at risk for developing sepsis due to her acute on chronic renal failure and fluid overload.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: the patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to her anemia and anticoagulation therapy.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: the patient is at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias due to her CHF and anticoagulation therapy.
5. Renal failure: the patient is at risk for developing renal failure due to her acute on chronic renal failure and fluid overload.
6. Infection: the patient is at risk for developing infection due to her immunosuppressed state and fluid overload.
7. Respiratory failure: the patient is at risk for developing respiratory failure due to her chronic heart failure and fluid overload.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, fluid status, and laboratory results to prevent or manage potential medical complications."

   24 Hour Events:
   -renal stopped by:  said HD not the best idea for now; instead better
   to manage her BP and volume status; okay with increasing labetalol and

   -Around 1800, got 10 mg IV hydral for BP > 180; went into afib
   following this, with HRs in 130s-150s; pt reported palpitations but
   otherwise asymptomatic.  K+ low at 3.4.  Blood gas okay. Got one-time
   dose of lopressor; labetolol was uptitrated to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] --> TID.
   Returned to sinus rhythm within ~1 hr of flipping into afib with HRs
   back in the 80s. Throughout night had multiple reversions to afib with
   HRs in 130s-140s: esmolol drip started with bolus of 250 mcg/kg then
   running at 150 mcg/kg/min given persistence of tachycardia; HRs
   improved to 60s-70s, BP in the 150s, satting in mid 80s.  ABG at 5 AM
   showed pO2: 55  pCO2: 41 pH:7.38 HCO3 25.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##.  Atrial fibrillation - New onset, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
   Unclear etiology.  Electrolytes have been within normal limits; could
   be triggered by worsening afterload/hypertension, worsening of CHF,
   hypoxia, worsening of valvular dysfunction (has history of MR, although
   most recent echo does not support this).  Currently on labetalol 100
   TID and on esmolol drip running at 150 mcg/hr with HRs back in sinus
   and BPs in the 150s systolic.
   -Obtain 2D echo to evaluate for worsening of systolic function; per
   echo in early [**2126-7-23**], had mild LVH, normal systolic function, no
   valvular disease
   -Optimize BP control with labetalol + can add Imdur 60 mg [**Hospital1 **] per cards
   recs
   -Rate control with labetalol and esmolol
   -Per CHADS2: she scores 4:  should be started on coumadin.  INR is
   currently 1.3.    Currently in sinus but if reverts back to atrial
   fibrillation, consider starting anticoagulation.
   .
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic heart failure, exacerbated by high afterload and
   worsening renal function.  CXR shows florid pulm edema. Received lasix
   120 mg IV X 1 yesterday with diuresis of ~.8 L.   Creatinine improved
   from 4.1 to 3.9.   Got another 120 mg IV X 1 this morning, repeat
   creatinine stable at 4.0.
   - not diuresing much with lasix boluses; consider adding metolazone to
   lasix;  slight improvement in renal function suggests that there might
   be room for further diuresis
   - repeat CXR this AM
   .
   ##. CHF:  on Labetolol, Amlodipine, clonidine. Improving end organ
   perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement in renal
   function.    She has history of MR, which is evident on exam and prior
   ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and may be a
   contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   - Given that could be secondary to MR, need to continue afterload
   reduction.  On amlodipine, hydral only being given if SBP > 180, also
   on labetalol and esmolol drip.   Further diuresis with lasix +
   metolazone may prove useful.  Can put on standing hydralazine.  Should
   repeat echo to evaluate mitral valve function.
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
   .
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   .
   ## Anemia: HCTs are stable.
   .
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has
   wrist restraints.  EKG being repeated this AM to look for QT
   prolongation.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -renal stopped by:  said HD not the best idea for now; instead better
   to manage her BP and volume status; okay with increasing labetalol and
   w/ continued clonidine patch
   -cardiology recs:  treat BP with imdur 60 [**Hospital1 **], hydral 10 mg q6 hrs, can
   continue amlodipine, and can uptitrate labetolol to get HR 50s-60s.
   Will also probably benefit from lasix long term.  Suggest trying to
   wean off clonidine
   -Around 1800, got 10 mg IV hydral for BP > 180; went into afib
   following this, with HRs in 130s-150s; pt reported palpitations but
   otherwise asymptomatic.  K+ low at 3.4.  Blood gas okay. Got one-time
   dose of lopressor; labetolol was uptitrated to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] --> TID.
   Returned to sinus rhythm within ~1 hr of flipping into afib with HRs
   back in the 80s. Throughout night had multiple reversions to afib with
   HRs in 130s-140s: esmolol drip started with bolus of 250 mcg/kg then
   running at 150 mcg/kg/min given persistence of tachycardia; HRs
   improved to 60s-70s, BP in the 150s, satting in mid 80s.  ABG at 5 AM
   showed pO2: 55  pCO2: 41 pH:7.38 HCO3 25.
   -Cards notified about new onset afib; consider anticoagulation. They
   suggest searching for other sources of hypertension (pheo, thyroid).
   -renal stopped by:  said HD not the best idea for now; instead better
   to manage her BP and volume status; okay with increasing labetalol and
   w/ continued clonidine patch
   -cardiology recs:  treat BP with imdur 60 [**Hospital1 **], hydral 10 mg q6 hrs, can
   continue amlodipine, and can uptitrate labetolol to get HR 50s-60s.
   Will also probably benefit from lasix long term.  Suggest trying to
   wean off clonidine
   -Put on high flow aerosol mask at 50% FiO2
   -120 mg IV lasix given X 2: net balance -800 mL prior to second dose

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, hypoxic respiratory failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient's 24-hour events are significant for the development of atrial fibrillation, which was treated with labetalol and esmolol. Her blood pressure (BP) remains labile, ranging from 120 to 180 systolic, and she has required multiple doses of hydralazine to control her BP. Her renal function has improved slightly with diuresis, but her creatinine remains elevated at 4.0.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 8.7 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 26.5%
* Platelet count: 296,000/mL
* Creatinine: 4.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 69 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, chloride 96 mmol/L
* Arterial blood gas (ABG) results: pH 7.38, pO2 55 mmHg, pCO2 41 mmHg

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Tachycardic with an irregular rhythm
* Bilateral crackles on anterior lung fields
* Nontender abdomen
* Warm, 1+ pulses distally with no lower extremity edema

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Optimization of BP control with labetalol and hydralazine
* Rate control with labetalol and esmolol
* Diuresis with lasix and metolazone
* Afterload reduction with amlodipine and hydralazine
* Sedation with haloperidol for agitation
* Repeat echocardiogram to evaluate mitral valve function
* Repeat CXR to evaluate pulmonary edema
* Continue anticoagulation with coumadin

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening of atrial fibrillation with increased risk of stroke
* Progression of CHF with increased risk of pulmonary edema
* Further decline in renal function with increased risk of acute kidney injury
* Development of electrolyte imbalances with potential for arrhythmias
* Agitation and delirium with potential for worsening of hypertension

   Assessment and Plan

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
 OLIGURIA/ANURIA

 .H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 PULMONARY EDEMA
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR shows improving pulmonary edema. Received
   500mg diuril IV followed by lasix 120 mg IV.  Diuresis of 1400cc over
   36 hrs.     Creatinine improving from ed from 4.0  to 3.9.   Got
   another 120 mg IV X 1 this morning, repeat creatinine stable at 4.0.
   - ECHO - shows mild LVH, normal systolic function, 2+ mitral regurg
   - slight improvement in renal function suggests that there might be
   room for further diuresis
   - optimize volume status with slower diuresis, goal
 500cc /day
   - repeat CXR in AM
   .
   ##.  Atrial fibrillation - New onset, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
   Unclear etiology.  Likely [**12-24**] to hypoxia/volume overload/hypertension/
   worsening valvular dysfunction (dynamic mitral regurgitation).
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replaceme.  Electrolytes have been within normal limits; could
   be triggered by worsening afterload/hypertension, worsening of CHF,
   hypoxia, worsening of valvular dysfunction (has history of MR, although
   most recent echo does not support this).
   - Rate control with labetalol 100 TID, addition of metoprolol 25mg tid,
   titrating esmolol down as HR has normalized.
   - start heparin w/o bolus for anticoagulation, will discuss with family
   regarding long term anticoagulation
   ##. CHF/mitral regurg:  on Labetolol, Amlodipine, clonidine. Improving
   end organ perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement
   in renal function.   She has history of MR, which is evident on exam
   and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and
   may be a contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   -  Discontinue amlodipine,
   - Continue labetolol, lasix, started on Imdur 30 [**Hospital1 **] and metoprolol
   25tid,
   - Clonidine reduced to 0.1mg/24h.
   - increase hydral as standing dose to maintain BP
   - when renal function improves, optimally start ACEI and d/c hydral.
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow
   ## Anemia: HCTs are stable.
   - f/u retic count
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has
   wrist restraints.  Total of 1.5mg over 24 hrs.
   ##. Goals of care - Son does not want to pursue long term ventilation
   without foreseeable improvement.  Will reassess and speak with son on
   Thursday or [**Name (NI) 1583**].
   ##. FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, start PO diet as intubation less
   lilkey at this time. .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided daily progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, DM-II, right subclavian stenosis, and CKD, who was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by CVA. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and oliguria/anuria.

The patient's respiratory status is worsening, with a 24-hour chest x-ray showing a large pleural effusion on the right and cephalization consistent with pulmonary edema. She has been placed on non-invasive ventilation and has required CPAP to improve her oxygen saturation.

The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, with new-onset atrial fibrillation and moderate mitral regurgitation. Her creatinine levels have improved slightly, but she still has acute on chronic renal failure. She has been started on diuretics and has undergone echocardiography, which showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a systolic blood pressure of 178/53 mmHg, a heart rate of 79 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 99%, and her ABG shows a pH of 7.38, pCO2 of 39 mmHg, and pO2 of 113 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination shows rales to the mid lung fields bilaterally, reduced breath sounds on the right, and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex. Her abdomen is soft, and her extremities show 2+ deep tendon reflexes.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.3 K/uL, a hemoglobin level of 8.4 g/dL, and a platelet count of 382 K/uL. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 23 mEq/L, and her creatinine level is 3.9 mg/dL. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's imaging studies show a large pleural effusion on the right and cephalization consistent with pulmonary edema on chest x-ray. Her echocardiogram shows mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic function.

The patient's medical and family history are significant for resistant hypertension, DM-II, right subclavian stenosis, and CKD. She has a history of MR, which is evident on exam and prior ECHO, although the most recent ECHO does not support this.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions include:

1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is already compromised, and further deterioration could lead to respiratory arrest or failure.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation could worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or stroke.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure could worsen, leading to end-stage renal disease or death.
4. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema could worsen, leading to respiratory failure or death.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization make her susceptible to infection, which could lead to sepsis or death.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's bleeding risk is increased due to her anticoagulation therapy and potential gastrointestinal ulcers.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of CVA and atrial fibrillation increase her risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.
8. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
9. Malnutrition: The patient's poor nutritional status could worsen, leading to malnutrition, weakness, and decreased immune function.

In conclusion, this patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications due to her complex medical conditions. Close monitoring and management of her respiratory, cardiac, renal, and gastrointestinal status are essential to prevent further deterioration and improve her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   - No imput from cardiology today.
   -Renal consult: Recommend IV Diuril 500 followed by IV Lasix --> 1400cc
   negative since yesterday MN.
   - called son and notified him of worsening respiratory status, had
   meeting with him discussing prognosis. He is HCP, form in chart. OK to
   intubate, reassess in a few days.
   - ECHO showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%, with
   elevated wedge pressure (>18mmHg). Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation,
   and moderate PA systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic pulmonic
   regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting pulmonary artery
   diastolic hypertension.
   - Imdur was started to reduce preload, at 30mg [**Hospital1 **], clonidine reduced
   but is qTuesday med.
   - CPAP was started at 3pm, stopped at 7pm, and restarted at 1am due to
   worsening O2 sats.  With improving ABG she was restarted on face mask
   at 6am.

   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR shows improving pulmonary edema. Received
   500mg diuril IV followed by lasix 120 mg IV.  Diuresis of 1400cc over
   36 hrs.     Creatinine improving from ed from 4.0  to 3.9.   Got
   another 120 mg IV X 1 this morning, repeat creatinine stable at 4.0.
   - optimize volume status with aggressive diuresis - continue  lasix
   boluses in addition to metolazone
   - ECHO - [**Last Name (un) 1830**] mild LVH, normal systolic function, 2+ mitral regurg
   - slight improvement in renal function suggests that there might be
   room for further diuresis
   - repeat CXR in AM
   .
   ##.  Atrial fibrillation - New onset, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
   Unclear etiology.  Likely [**12-24**] to hypoxia/volume overload/hypertension/
   worsening valvular dysfunction (dynamic mitral regurgitation).
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replaceme.  Electrolytes have been within normal limits; could
   be triggered by worsening afterload/hypertension, worsening of CHF,
   hypoxia, worsening of valvular dysfunction (has history of MR, although
   most recent echo does not support this).
   - Rate control with labetalol 100 TID, titrating esmolol down as HR has
   normalized.
   - should start anticoagulation today (CHADS2 = 4)
   ##. CHF/mitral regurg:  on Labetolol, Amlodipine, clonidine. Improving
   end organ perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement
   in renal function.   She has history of MR, which is evident on exam
   and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and
   may be a contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   - Given that could be secondary to MROn amlodipine, hydral only being
   given if SBP > 180, also on labetalol.  Further diuresis with lasix +
   diuril.  Started Imdur 20mg [**Hospital1 **], reduced clonidine to 0.1mg/24h from
   0.2mg/24hr.
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
   - ask cards re: management
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, DM-II, right subclavian stenosis, and CKD, who was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by CVA. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening respiratory failure, oliguria/anuria, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has a large pleural effusion on the right side, consistent with pulmonary edema, which has improved from yesterday's CXR.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 9.3
* Hct: 26.0
* Plt: 382
* Cr: 4.0
* TCO2: 22
* Glucose: 139
* Lactic Acid: 0.8 mmol/L
* LDH: 180 IU/L
* Ca++: 10.0 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL

The patient's plan includes:

* Optimizing volume status with aggressive diuresis
* Continuing Lasix boluses in addition to metolazone
* ECHO to assess LVH and mitral regurgitation
* Repeat CXR in the morning
* Rate control with labetalol and esmolol
* Anticoagulation with warfarin
* Afterload reduction with amlodipine and hydralazine
* Strict I/O management to ensure patient remains negative
* Daily weights and low Na diet
* Renal dose medications
* Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward flow

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and worsening renal function
* Atrial fibrillation with uncertain etiology
* Chronic kidney disease with potential for further decline
* Hypertension with labile pressures
* Acute kidney injury due to prolonged renal ischemia
* Anemia with stable HCTs
* Agitation with potential for worsening
* Potential for further deterioration in respiratory and cardiac function
* Risk of bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Risk of electrolyte imbalances due to diuretic therapy and renal dysfunction
* Risk of infection due to prolonged hospitalization and invasive lines."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -1.5 L over last 24 hrs without lasix bolus;
   overall -6.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -To reduce afterload, continue hydralazine and labetalol.  Also on
   metoprolol and isosorbide.   Titrating down esmolol drip.
   -Goal is 500 ccs/daily
   -F/u CXR today
   -Need to optimize diuresis regimen; apparently has had multiple
   admissions with pulmonary edema, so unlikely fluid will stay off.  Need
   to determine optimum diuresis regimen prior to discharge.
   -F/u cards recs
   .
   ##.  Atrial fibrillation - New onset, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
   Unclear etiology.  Likely [**12-24**] to hypoxia/volume overload/hypertension/
   worsening valvular dysfunction (dynamic mitral regurgitation).
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.  Electrolytes have been within normal limits; could
   be triggered by worsening afterload/hypertension, worsening of CHF,
   hypoxia, worsening of valvular dysfunction.
   -Not tolerating coming off esmolol drip: goes back into afib.
   Currently on rate control with labetalol 50 TID,  metoprolol increased
   to 75mg tid, continue to titrate esmolol down as HR normalizes.
   -Given difficult to control, consider cardioversion, talk w/ cards,
   although getting outside of window of opportunity to cardiovert w/o
   anticoagulation
   -Holding off on anticoagulation for now, CHADS2 of 4.
   .
   ##. CHF/mitral regurg:  on Labetolol, Amlodipine, clonidine. Improving
   end organ perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement
   in renal function.   She has history of MR, which is evident on exam
   and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and
   may be a contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   - Continue labetolol,  started on Imdur 30 [**Hospital1 **] and metoprolol 75tid,
   - Clonidine reduced to 0.1mg/24h.
   - increased hydral as standing dose to maintain BP
   - when renal function improves, optimally start ACEI and d/c hydral.
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
    .
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   .
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow
    .
   ## Anemia: HCTs are stable.
   .
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has
   wrist restraints.  Total of 1.5mg over 24 hrs.
   .
   ##. Goals of care - Son does not want to pursue long term ventilation
   without foreseeable improvement.  Will reassess and speak with son on
   Thursday or [**Name (NI) 1583**].
   .
   ##. FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, start PO diet as intubation less
   lilkey at this time. .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypoxic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and acute on chronic renal failure. Her vital signs are stable, but she continues to experience atrial fibrillation, which is not well-controlled with medication. Her creatinine level is stable at 3.9 mg/dL, and her fluid balance is negative, indicating diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not well-controlled, and there is a risk of it worsening, which could lead to further complications such as heart failure, stroke, or death.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is stable, but there is still a risk of AKI due to her underlying CKD and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative, but there is still a risk of fluid overload, which could lead to further complications such as pulmonary edema, heart failure, or death.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing an infection due to her prolonged hospitalization and the use of invasive devices such as central lines and urinary catheters.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is still a risk of respiratory failure, particularly if her atrial fibrillation worsens or if she develops an infection.
6. Cardiac arrest: The patient's code status is full code, which means that she is willing to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if her heart stops. However, there is still a risk of cardiac arrest due to her underlying medical conditions and the use of medications such as beta blockers and diuretics.
7. Stroke: The patient's history of CVA and her current atrial fibrillation increase her risk of having a stroke."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -1.5 L over last 24 hrs without lasix bolus;
   overall -6.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -To reduce afterload, continue hydralazine and labetalol.  Also on
   metoprolol and isosorbide.   Titrating down esmolol drip.
   -Goal is 500 ccs/daily
   -F/u CXR today
   -Need to optimize diuresis regimen; apparently has had multiple
   admissions with pulmonary edema, so unlikely fluid will stay off.  Need
   to determine optimum diuresis regimen prior to discharge.
   -F/u cards recs
   .
   ##.  Atrial fibrillation - New onset, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
   Unclear etiology.  Likely [**12-24**] to hypoxia/volume overload/hypertension/
   worsening valvular dysfunction (dynamic mitral regurgitation).
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.  Electrolytes have been within normal limits; could
   be triggered by worsening afterload/hypertension, worsening of CHF,
   hypoxia, worsening of valvular dysfunction.
   -Not tolerating coming off esmolol drip: goes back into afib.
   Currently on rate control with labetalol 50 TID,  metoprolol increased
   to 75mg tid, continue to titrate esmolol down as HR normalizes.
   -f/u cards recs, look back to see if hx of afib, ablation candidate?
   -Holding off on anticoagulation for now, CHADS2 of 4.
   .
   ##. CHF/mitral regurg:  on Labetolol, Amlodipine, clonidine. Improving
   end organ perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement
   in renal function.   She has history of MR, which is evident on exam
   and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and
   may be a contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   - Continue labetolol,  started on Imdur 30 [**Hospital1 **] and metoprolol 75tid,
   - Clonidine reduced to 0.1mg/24h.
   - increased hydral as standing dose to maintain BP
   - when renal function improves, optimally start ACEI and d/c hydral.
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
    .
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   .
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow
    .
   ## Anemia: HCTs are stable.
   .
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has
   wrist restraints.  Total of 1.5mg over 24 hrs.

   without foreseeable improvement.  Will reassess and speak with son on

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary edema and worsening renal function.

The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR), which is believed to be secondary to hypoxia, volume overload, hypertension, and worsening valvular dysfunction. She has been treated with hydralazine, labetalol, metoprolol, and esmolol, but has not tolerated coming off the esmolol drip due to recurrent AFib.

The patient has also been experiencing agitation and delirium, which has been managed with sedation and haloperidol. She has been on a low sodium diet and has had strict input/output monitoring to ensure a negative balance.

The patient's creatinine has improved from 4.7 to 3.9, but her estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is still low, suggesting ongoing kidney damage. She has also been experiencing anemia, which has been managed with blood transfusions.

1. Worsening renal function: The patient's creatinine has improved, but her eGFR is still low, suggesting ongoing kidney damage. Further diuresis and optimization of renal perfusion may be necessary to prevent further decline in renal function.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema has improved, but she is still at risk for further fluid accumulation and worsening respiratory failure.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's AFib has been managed with rate control medications, but she has not tolerated coming off the esmolol drip due to recurrent AFib. Further management of AFib may be necessary to prevent further complications.
4. Agitation and delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium have been managed with sedation and haloperidol, but further management may be necessary to prevent further complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia has been managed with blood transfusions, but further management may be necessary to prevent further complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction and renally dosed medications.
2. Consider further diuresis to improve forward flow and prevent further decline in renal function.
3. Monitor the patient's creatinine and eGFR closely to ensure that her kidney function is improving.
4. Continue to manage the patient's atrial fibrillation with rate control medications and consider further management options if necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's agitation and delirium with sedation and haloperidol, and consider further management options if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's anemia and consider further management options if necessary.
7. Consider scheduling a cardiology consultation to discuss further management options for the patient's atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -1.5 L over last 24 hrs without lasix bolus;
   overall -6.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -To reduce afterload, continue hydralazine and labetalol.  Also on
   metoprolol and isosorbide.   Titrating down esmolol drip.
   -Goal is 500 ccs/daily
   -F/u CXR today
   -Need to optimize diuresis regimen; apparently has had multiple
   admissions with pulmonary edema, so unlikely fluid will stay off.  Need
   to determine optimum diuresis regimen prior to discharge.
   -F/u cards recs
   .
   ##.  Atrial fibrillation - New onset, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
   Unclear etiology.  Likely [**12-24**] to hypoxia/volume overload/hypertension/
   worsening valvular dysfunction (dynamic mitral regurgitation).
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.  Electrolytes have been within normal limits; could
   be triggered by worsening afterload/hypertension, worsening of CHF,
   hypoxia, worsening of valvular dysfunction.
   -Not tolerating coming off esmolol drip: goes back into afib.
   Currently on rate control with labetalol 50 TID,  metoprolol increased
   to 75mg tid, continue to titrate esmolol down as HR normalizes.
   -f/u cards recs, look back to see if hx of afib, ablation candidate?
   -Holding off on anticoagulation for now, CHADS2 of 4.
   .
   ##. CHF/mitral regurg:  on Labetolol, Amlodipine, clonidine. Improving
   end organ perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement
   in renal function.   She has history of MR, which is evident on exam
   and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and
   may be a contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   - Continue labetolol,  started on Imdur 30 [**Hospital1 **] and metoprolol 75tid,
   - Clonidine reduced to 0.1mg/24h.
   - increased hydral as standing dose to maintain BP
   - when renal function improves, optimally start ACEI and d/c hydral.
   - maintain strict I/O
s to ensure patient remains negative, daily
   weights and low Na diet
    .
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   .
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow
    .
   ## Anemia: HCTs are stable.
   .
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has
   wrist restraints.  Total of 1.5mg over 24 hrs.
   .
   ##. Goals of care - Son does not want to pursue long term ventilation
   without foreseeable improvement.  Will reassess and speak with son on
   Thursday or [**Name (NI) 1583**].
   .
   ##. FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, start PO diet as intubation less
   lilkey at this time. .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   end organ perfusion shows some improvement as evidenced by improvement
   in renal function.   She has history of MR, which is evident on exam
   and prior ECHO (although most recent ECHO does not support this), and
   may be a contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema.
   - Continue labetolol,  started on Imdur 30 [**Hospital1 **] and metoprolol 75tid,
   - Clonidine reduced to 0.1mg/24h.
   - increased hydral as standing dose to maintain BP

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypoxic respiratory failure and worsening renal function.

The patient has been experiencing atrial fibrillation (AFib) with unclear etiology, which may be related to hypoxia, volume overload, hypertension, and worsening valvular dysfunction. She is currently on rate control medications and is being monitored for potential ablation candidacy.

The patient's chronic mitral regurgitation (MR) is a contributing factor to her worsening pulmonary edema, and she has a history of fluid overload and worsening renal function. Her creatinine levels have improved from 4.7 to 3.9, but her renal function is still compromised.

The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, which may be secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from prolonged renal ischemia. Her urine output is low, and her fractional excretion of urea (FEurea) is elevated, suggesting ATN. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, but she has been experiencing agitation and delirium.

The patient's anemia is being managed with transfusions, and her hemoglobin levels are stable. She has been experiencing agitation, which is being treated with Haldol, and she has wrist restraints.

The patient's goals of care are to avoid long-term ventilation without foreseeable improvement, and her son has been involved in decision-making. The patient is currently on prophylactic medications, including subcutaneous heparin and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and has a PICC line placed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening renal function: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and her renal function is compromised. Further deterioration in renal function could lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or the need for dialysis.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's AFib is not well-controlled, and further episodes could lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even sudden cardiac death.
3. Chronic mitral regurgitation: The patient's MR is a contributing factor to her pulmonary edema and worsening renal function. Further deterioration in MR could lead to heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. Acute tubular necrosis: The patient's ATN is a complication of prolonged renal ischemia. Further deterioration in renal function could lead to ESRD or the need for dialysis.
5. Agitation and delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium are being treated with Haldol, but further episodes could lead to increased risk of falls, pressure ulcers, or other complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is being managed with transfusions, but further episodes of bleeding or blood loss could lead to worsening anemia or the need for more frequent transfusions.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple comorbidities and complications. Further management and monitoring are necessary to prevent and manage potential complications and to improve her overall clinical outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -0.5 L up until midnight without any lasix bolus;
   overall -7.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -Currently strategy for managing pulmonary edema:
   (1) afterload reduction:  standing hydralazine, isosorbide and
   metoprolol.  Yesterday D/C
d labetalol, esmolol drip. Pressures this AM
   are 170/70; needs much improved systolic control.  Can push up
   hydralazine (currently on 25 q8) -> can go to 50 mg q8.  Reducing
   afterload is of critical importance to reducing her MR and improving
   her respiratory status, so we can be aggressive with this.  Could
   consider switching from metoprolol to labetalol, since labetalol will
   provide better BP control.   Further diuresis only important for
   afterload reduction rather than taking off fluid; is -0.5 L daily
   without any lasix, so would not aggressively diurese at this point.
   -Change to hydral 50 mg q8
   -Consider metoprolol -> labetalol for better BP control; increase to
   200 mg TID
   -wouldn
t aggressively diurese: goal set at -.5 L /day, follow Is and
   Os
   (2) controlling heart rates:  developed new onset afib three days ago.
   Currently HRs are in 110s
 120s but EKG obtained during tachycardia
   more suggestive of sinus tachycardia than atrial fibrillation.  Unclear
   what is causing her tachycardia:  unlikely to be intravascularly
   depleted because renal function is stable even with diuresis;  TSH is
   low but free T4 is normal, is not febrile; has history of anxiety,
   could consider better anxiety control.
   - Currently on metoprolol 100 mg, can consider switch to labetalol at
   higher dose (max dose of labetalol is 1600 mg/day!); continue
   amiodarone to maintain sinus.
   - IV heparin for anticoagulation given CHADS2 score of 5 (high risk for
   stroke)
   -F/u secondary causes of tachycardia:  free T4 normal, urine
   metanephrines pending, tx of anxiety
   .
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   .
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow
    .
   ## Anemia: HCT fell slightly; check afternoon HCT, especially since
   started on heparin IV yesterday.
   .
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -0.5 L up until midnight without any lasix bolus;
   overall -7.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -Currently strategy for managing pulmonary edema:
   (1) afterload reduction:  standing hydralazine, isosorbide and
   metoprolol.  Yesterday D/C
d labetalol, esmolol drip. Pressures this AM
   are 170/70; needs much improved systolic control.  Can push up
   hydralazine (currently on 25 q8) -> can go to 50 mg q8.  Reducing
   afterload is of critical importance to reducing her MR and improving
   her respiratory status, so we can be aggressive with this.  Could
   consider switching from metoprolol to labetalol, since labetalol will
   provide better BP control.   Further diuresis only important for
   afterload reduction rather than taking off fluid; is -0.5 L daily
   without any lasix, so would not aggressively diurese at this point.
   -Change to hydral 50 mg q8
   -Consider metoprolol -> labetalol for better BP control; increase to
   200 mg TID
   -wouldn
t aggressively diurese: goal set at -.5 L /day, follow Is and
   Os
   (2) controlling heart rates:  developed new onset afib three days ago.
   Currently HRs are in 110s
 120s but EKG obtained during tachycardia
   more suggestive of sinus tachycardia than atrial fibrillation.  Unclear
   what is causing her tachycardia:  unlikely to be intravascularly
   depleted because renal function is stable even with diuresis;  TSH is
   low but free T4 is normal, is not febrile; has history of anxiety,
   could consider better anxiety control.
   - Currently on metoprolol 100 mg, can consider switch to labetalol at
   higher dose (max dose of labetalol is 1600 mg/day!); continue
   amiodarone to maintain sinus.
   - IV heparin for anticoagulation given CHADS2 score of 5 (high risk for
   stroke)
   -F/u secondary causes of tachycardia:  free T4 normal, urine
   metanephrines pending, tx of anxiety
   .
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   .
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 4.0 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds. Consider further diuresis for improvement of forward
   flow
    .
   ## Anemia: HCT fell slightly; check afternoon HCT, especially since
   started on heparin IV yesterday.
   .
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation and avoiding benzos. Has
   wrist restraints.  Total of 1.5mg over 24 hrs.
   .
   ##. Goals of care - Son does not want to pursue long term ventilation
   without foreseeable improvement.  Will reassess and speak with son on
   Thursday or [**Name (NI) 1583**].
   .
   ##. FEN: Nutrition recommends adding Benepak supplements to food and
   increasing PO intake; replete electrolytes as PRN, not currently giving

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with hypoxic respiratory failure and worsening renal function. The patient has a high risk of stroke and is being treated with IV heparin for anticoagulation.

The patient's condition is complicated by:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient has fluid overload and worsening renal function, which is exacerbating her pulmonary edema.
2. Tachycardia: The patient has developed new-onset atrial fibrillation, which is being treated with amiodarone. However, the underlying cause of her tachycardia is unclear.
3. Hypertension: The patient has labile blood pressures ranging from 120/80 to 180/120, which is exacerbating her hypertension.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have improved from 4.7 to 4.0 with continued diuresis, but there is still room for further improvement.
5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) has fallen slightly, and further assessment is needed.
6. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, which is being managed with Haldol and wrist restraints.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's fluid overload and worsening renal function could lead to further worsening of her pulmonary edema, which could be life-threatening.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia could lead to further cardiac complications, such as atrial fibrillation or flutter, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Hypertension: The patient's labile blood pressures could lead to further cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's acute kidney injury could worsen her chronic kidney disease, leading to further complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia could lead to further complications, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, or decreased cognitive function.
6. Agitation: The patient's agitation could lead to further complications, such as physical harm or injury, or even cardiac arrest.

Plan:

1. Continue to manage the patient's pulmonary edema with diuresis and afterload reduction.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's tachycardia and adjust her medication as needed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with afterload reduction and medication adjustment.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust her medication as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and adjust her medication as needed.
6. Continue to manage the patient's agitation with Haldol and wrist restraints, and consider further interventions as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):  Now looks like sinus tachycardia on the
   monitor.  Repeat 12 lead ECG.  On lopressor and amiodarone.  On IV
   heparin, PTT 150, held and decreased dose.  Repeat PTT at noon.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Pulmonary edema in
   setting of significant MR, diastolic dysfunction and suboptimal
   afterload reduction.  Appears comforable sitting up at ~45 degrees in
   bed.  Continues on hydralazine and isordil.  Try to increase
   hydralazine.  Hold on diruesis as we adjust her meds.  Continues to
   have tenuous respiratory status.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Continue patch.  No
   complaint of pain except at IV site when potassium given.
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE:
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Now on standing haldol dose
   per psychiatry service.
 PULMONARY EDEMA:  As above.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Cr staying around 4.0. Repeat urine
   lytes.  Continue to monitor as we increase her afterload reduction as
   above.
 ANEMA:  Hct slightly decreased, will check pm hct given she has been
   started on heparin. Guaiac all stools.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):  Now looks like sinus tachycardia on the
   monitor.  Repeat 12 lead ECG.  On lopressor and amiodarone.  On IV
   heparin, PTT 150, held and decreased dose.  Repeat PTT at noon.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Pulmonary edema in
   setting of significant MR, diastolic dysfunction and suboptimal
   afterload reduction.  Appears comforable sitting up at ~45 degrees in
   bed.  Continues on hydralazine and isordil.  Try to increase
   hydralazine.  Hold on diruesis as we adjust her meds.  Continues to
   have tenuous respiratory status.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Continue patch.  No
   complaint of pain except at IV site when potassium given.
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE:
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Now on standing haldol dose
   per psychiatry service.
 PULMONARY EDEMA:  As above.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Cr staying around 4.0. Repeat urine
   lytes.  Continue to monitor as we increase her afterload reduction as
   above.
 ANEMA:  Hct slightly decreased, will check pm hct given she has been
   started on heparin. Guaiac all stools.

 PULMONARY EDEMA
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -0.5 L up until midnight without any lasix bolus;
   overall -7.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -Currently strategy for managing pulmonary edema:
   (1) afterload reduction:  standing hydralazine, isosorbide and
   metoprolol.  Metoprolol currently being held due to bradycardia
   (55-63).   Pressures this AM are 170/70; needs much improved systolic
   control.  On hydral 75mg qid, can increase isosorbide dinitrate.
   Reducing afterload is of critical importance to reducing her MR and
   improving her respiratory status, so we can be aggressive with this.
   Further diuresis only important for afterload reduction rather than
   taking off fluid; is -0.5 L daily without any lasix, so would not
   aggressively diurese at this point.
   -Change to hydral 75 qid
   -Consider metoprolol -> labetalol for better BP control; increase to
   200 mg TID
   -wouldn
t aggressively diurese: goal set at -.5 L /day, follow Is and
   Os
   - anxiety is a large component of hypertension, ativan prn has improved
   htn
   (2) controlling heart rates:  developed new onset afib three days ago.
   Currently HRs are in 110s
 120s but EKG obtained during tachycardia
   more suggestive of sinus tachycardia than atrial fibrillation.  Unclear
   what is causing her tachycardia:  unlikely to be intravascularly
   depleted because renal function is stable even with diuresis;  TSH is
   low but free T4 is normal, is not febrile; has history of anxiety,
   could consider better anxiety control.
   -  continue amiodarone to maintain sinus.   600mg daily X 1 week,
   followed by 400mg daily, titrate to lowest effective maintenance dose
   - BB/CCB options to improve rate control, but already doing well.
   - IV heparin for anticoagulation given CHADS2 score of 5 (high risk for
   stroke)
   -F/u secondary causes of tachycardia:  free T4 normal, urine
   metanephrines pending, tx of anxiety
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 3.8 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds.
   ## Anemia: HCT fell slightly; s/p one unit yesterday.  Likey cause is
   phelobotomization.  Guaic negative
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation .
   - using ativan when agitated and actuely hypertensive as it has shown
   better effect.
   ##. Goals of care - Pt and son do not want to pursue long term
   ventilation without foreseeable improvement.  .
   ##. FEN: Nutrition recommends adding Benepak supplements to food and
   increasing PO intake; replete electrolytes as PRN, not currently giving
   any fluids.

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -0.5 L up until midnight without any lasix bolus;
   overall -7.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -Currently strategy for managing pulmonary edema:
   (1) afterload reduction:  standing hydralazine, isosorbide and
   metoprolol.  Metoprolol currently being held due to bradycardia
   (55-63).   Pressures this AM are 170/70; needs much improved systolic
   control.  On hydral 75mg qid, can increase isosorbide dinitrate.
   Reducing afterload is of critical importance to reducing her MR and
   improving her respiratory status, so we can be aggressive with this.
   Further diuresis only important for afterload reduction rather than
   taking off fluid; is -0.5 L daily without any lasix, so would not
   aggressively diurese at this point.
   -Change to hydral 75 qid
   -Consider metoprolol -> labetalol for better BP control; increase to
   200 mg TID
   -wouldn
t aggressively diurese: goal set at -.5 L /day, follow Is and
   Os
   - anxiety is a large component of hypertension, ativan prn has improved
   htn
   (2) controlling heart rates:  developed new onset afib three days ago.
   Currently HRs are in 110s
 120s but EKG obtained during tachycardia
   more suggestive of sinus tachycardia than atrial fibrillation.  Unclear
   what is causing her tachycardia:  unlikely to be intravascularly
   depleted because renal function is stable even with diuresis;  TSH is
   low but free T4 is normal, is not febrile; has history of anxiety,
   could consider better anxiety control.
   -  continue amiodarone to maintain sinus.   600mg daily X 1 week,
   followed by 400mg daily, titrate to lowest effective maintenance dose
   - BB/CCB options to improve rate control, but already doing well.
   - IV heparin for anticoagulation given CHADS2 score of 5 (high risk for
   stroke)
   -F/u secondary causes of tachycardia:  free T4 normal, urine
   metanephrines pending, tx of anxiety
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 3.8 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds.
   ## Anemia: HCT fell slightly; s/p one unit yesterday.  Likey cause is
   phelobotomization.  Guaic negative
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation .
   - using ativan when agitated and actuely hypertensive as it has shown
   better effect.
   ##. Goals of care - Pt and son do not want to pursue long term
   ventilation without foreseeable improvement.  .
   ##. FEN: Nutrition recommends adding Benepak supplements to food and
   increasing PO intake; replete electrolytes as PRN, not currently giving
   any fluids.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to worsening respiratory failure, acute oliguria/anuria, and altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 61 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 177/67 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 91%
* SpO2: 91%

The patient has a number of comorbidities, including atrial fibrillation (AFIB), pulmonary edema, and chronic mitral regurgitation (MR). Her renal function is worsening, with a creatinine level of 3.8 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 30.9 mg/dL. She has a history of anemia, and her hemoglobin level is 10.1 g/dL.

The patient's medications include hydralazine, isosorbide, metoprolol, and amiodarone, among others. She has a central venous catheter (CVC) and an arterial line (AL) in place.

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete blood count (CBC): 6.5 x 10^9/L (normal range: 4.5-11.5 x 10^9/L)
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 30.9 mg/dL (normal range: 7-20 mg/dL)
* Creatinine: 3.8 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Electrolytes: sodium 147 mg/dL (normal range: 135-145 mg/dL), potassium 4.1 mEq/L (normal range: 3.5-5.5 mEq/L), and chloride 96 mEq/L (normal range: 95-105 mEq/L)
* Glucose: 151 mg/dL (normal range: 70-100 mg/dL)

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pulmonary edema and chronic mitral regurgitation. Her oxygen saturation is 91%, which is below normal.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and her BUN level is also elevated. She has a history of CKD, which may be contributing to her AKI.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.1 g/dL, which is below normal. She has a history of anemia, and her BUN level is elevated, which may be contributing to her anemia.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of AFIB, which may be contributing to her tachycardia and altered mental status.
5. Pulmonary edema: The patient has a history of pulmonary edema, which may be contributing to her respiratory failure.
6. Chronic mitral regurgitation: The patient has a history of chronic mitral regurgitation, which may be contributing to her pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
7. Anxious/agitated behavior: The patient has a history of anxious/agitated behavior, which may be contributing to her tachycardia and altered mental status.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Afterload reduction: The patient is being treated with hydralazine, isosorbide, and metoprolol to reduce her afterload and improve her renal function.
2. Diuresis: The patient is being treated with diuretics to reduce her fluid overload and improve her renal function.
3. Sedation: The patient is being treated with sedatives, such as ativan, to reduce her anxiety and agitation.
4. Anticoagulation: The patient is being treated with heparin to prevent thrombosis.
5. Pain control: The patient is being treated with pain medication to control her pain.
6. Nutrition: The patient is being treated with nutrition supplements to improve her nutritional status.
7. Prophylaxis: The patient is being treated with prophylactic medications, such as PPI, to prevent complications."

 PULMONARY EDEMA
   This is a 77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II, right subclavian
   stenosis and CKD s/p recent hospitalization for HTN complicated by CVA
   p/w SOB in setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Believed to be secondary to pulmonary
   edema [**12-24**] to chronic mitral regurg (perhaps with dynamic component)
   exacerbated by high afterload and worsening renal function.
   Unfortunately, mitral regurg has limited treatment outside of
   repair/replacement.   CXR from yesterday shows improving pulmonary
   edema. Net balance of -0.5 L up until midnight without any lasix bolus;
   overall -7.5 L.    Creatinine stable at 3.9.
   -Currently strategy for managing pulmonary edema:
   (1) afterload reduction:  standing hydralazine, isosorbide and
   metoprolol.  Metoprolol currently being held due to bradycardia
   (55-63).   Pressures this AM are 170/70; needs much improved systolic
   control.  On hydral 75mg qid, can increase isosorbide dinitrate.
   Reducing afterload is of critical importance to reducing her MR and
   improving her respiratory status, so we can be aggressive with this.
   Further diuresis only important for afterload reduction rather than
   taking off fluid; is -0.5 L daily without any lasix, so would not
   aggressively diurese at this point.
   -Change to hydral 75 qid
   -Consider metoprolol -> labetalol for better BP control; increase to
   200 mg TID
   -wouldn
t aggressively diurese: goal set at -.5 L /day, follow Is and
   Os
   - anxiety is a large component of hypertension, ativan prn has improved
   htn
   (2) controlling heart rates:  developed new onset afib three days ago.
   Currently HRs are in 110s
 120s but EKG obtained during tachycardia
   more suggestive of sinus tachycardia than atrial fibrillation.  Unclear
   what is causing her tachycardia:  unlikely to be intravascularly
   depleted because renal function is stable even with diuresis;  TSH is
   low but free T4 is normal, is not febrile; has history of anxiety,
   could consider better anxiety control.
   -  continue amiodarone to maintain sinus.   600mg daily X 1 week,
   followed by 400mg daily, titrate to lowest effective maintenance dose
   - BB/CCB options to improve rate control, but already doing well.
   - IV heparin for anticoagulation given CHADS2 score of 5 (high risk for
   stroke)
   -F/u secondary causes of tachycardia:  free T4 normal, urine
   metanephrines pending, tx of anxiety
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 180
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure:. Pt's prior baseline Creatinine
   noted to be 2.2-2.9 during last admission currently elevated.  Etiology
   could be secondary to ATN from prolonged renal ischemia.  Creatinine
   has improved overall from 4.7 to about 3.8 with continued diuresis.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be room for further improvement with continued diuresis.   MRA
   performed confirming no RAS.
   - FEurea ~ 30% (equivocal) and UNa 69 more suggestive of ATN picture.
   Need to optimize renal perfusion with afterload reduction as above and
   renally dose meds.
   ## Anemia: HCT fell slightly; s/p one unit yesterday.  Likey cause is
   phelobotomization.  Guaic negative
   ##. Agitation:
   - Psych suggested using Haldol for agitation .
   - using ativan when agitated and actuely hypertensive as it has shown
   better effect.
   ##. Goals of care - Pt and son do not want to pursue long term
   ventilation without foreseeable improvement.  .
   ##. FEN: Nutrition recommends adding Benepak supplements to food and
   increasing PO intake; replete electrolytes as PRN, not currently giving

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, right subclavian stenosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She was recently hospitalized for hypertension complicated by a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and presents with shortness of breath (SOB) in the setting of fluid overload and worsening renal function.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 61 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 177/67 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 91%
* Hemoglobin: 30.6 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 10.3 K/uL
* Platelet count: 477 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 24 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.1 mEq/L

The patient has been treated with various medications, including hydralazine, metoprolol, and isosorbide, to manage her hypertension and pulmonary edema. She has also received IV heparin for anticoagulation and amiodarone to maintain sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 30.6 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 10.3 K/uL
* Platelet count: 477 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.8 mg/dL
* BUN: 24 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.1 mEq/L
* Sodium: 133 mEq/L
* Chloride: 96 mEq/L
* Carbon dioxide: 30.9%
* Glucose: 147 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Tachycardia with a heart rate of 61 bpm
* Hypertension with a blood pressure of 177/67 mmHg
* Respiratory failure with an oxygen saturation of 91%
* Oliguria/anuria with a urine output of 735 mL
* No peripheral edema or jugular venous distension

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Hypertensive crisis
* Pulmonary edema
* Acute respiratory failure
* Oliguria/anuria
* Chronic kidney disease
* Right subclavian stenosis
* Cerebrovascular accident

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening hypertension
* Pulmonary edema
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Chronic kidney disease progression
* Right subclavian stenosis worsening
* Cerebrovascular accident recurrence

The patient's goals of care are to avoid long-term ventilation and to pursue a plan that does not involve long-term ventilation without foreseeable improvement."

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 .H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 PULMONARY EDEMA
   Assessment/Plan:
   This is a 69yo man with history of CABG, atrial fibrillation with
   pacer/defibrillator on coumadin, systolic CHF (most recent echo in [**2123**]
   improved), and DMII who p/w acute onset of R-sided flank pain on
   [**2126-8-24**].   Abdominal CT showed evidence of right perirenal bleed
   possibly from a renal cyst.  Patient transferred to ICU for multiple
   reasons including possible UGIB, hypoxia and possible AMI.
   .
   (#) Hypoxia: improving; patient already down to 6LNC in the ICU.
   Evidence of volume overload on CXR.  Patient also had emesis and,
   though he is not at especially high risk, may have had an aspiration
   event.  He has not gotten an extra large amount of volume aside from
   the 4 units total of FFP.  He has now received lasix 20, then 40 mg IV
   though is urine output is only 20 cc over the last three to four
   hours.  (Of note, he did have 300 cc urine recorded in flow sheet at 11
   pm last night.)  Despite to putting out urine, the patient does report
   feeling better.  Low suspicion for PE or other pathology.
   -- cont to wean oxygen and diurese as tolerated
   -- aspiration precautions if he continues to vomit
   -- antiemetics PRN
   .
   (#) POSSIBLE UGIB: Pt had episode of guaiaic positive emesis in context
   of severe cough and post-tussive emesis.  Has been nauseaus since
   admission likely from RP bleed.  Pt has no h/o ETOH abuse, liver
   disease which would be concerning for ascities.  no known ulcer
   disease; denies upper bleed such as epistaxis and dental bleeding.
   - NPO; IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - maintain active T&S
   - Maintain Hct > 25 given large degree of drop from baseline (though
   possibly hemoconcentrated on admission)
   - possible GI c/s re: UGI
   .
   (#) Retroperitoneal bleed: Differential diagnosis broad at this point.
   No recent trauma. Causes of RP bleed could include: renal maignancy,
   pyelonephritis +/- abscess, vascular disease, rupture of renal cyst.
   Subcapsular and intraparenchymal bleed makes intrinsic kidney etiology
   most likely. Exophytic lesion on upper pole noted on CT (12->22mm since
   [**2123**]) but unrelated to current bleed. Bleed most likely exacerbated by
   warfarin (although not supratherapeutic INR ~2.5) and daily baby
   aspirin (functional platelet abnormalities).  Urology is following.
   Decreased urine output is concerning for progression of bleed affecting
   renal perfusion, and Cr has bumped from 2.3 --> 4.5 overnight.
   -- will call urology this am to touch base about the decreased urine
   output
   -- will give another 2 units FFP given possible progression of bleed
   -- cont holding warfarin, aspirin
   -- would lke to give RBC transfusion, but will hold given volume
   .
   (#) ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: unclear what his baseline is (seems
   to be in mid 2's); acute change with minimal UOP in last few hours is
   concerning for progression of the hematoma compromising blood flow to
   the kidney or IVC; also has a mildly elevated lactate.
   -- will repeat pelvis CT scan
   -Continue calcitriol 0.25 mcg PO DAILY
   -- renal diet when restarted
   .
   (#) POSSIBLE AMI: ST changes on EKG ordered for eval of nausea (not CP,
   albeit pt is diabetic) were considered ""artifact"" by cards fellow and
   normalized on repeat EKG.
   -- CE ordered with am labs though low suspicion will be positive
   -- cont statin; hold ASA given bleed
   .
   (#) Fever/Leukocytosis -  WBC currently 13.6 with left shift. Infection
   is highest on differential, although stress reaction to acute bleed,
   inflammatory, and neoplastic disease are also possible. No evidence fo
   PNA currently (though may have had an aspirtaion event last night).
   -- continue to monitor
   -- Check urine culture, blood culture
   .
   # CHF (h/o systolic dysfunction, though normalized on [**2123**] echo): Pt
   reports history of mild edema and recent weight gain. Known systolic
   dysfunction although LVEF in [**2123**] >55%.
   -Strict I's and O's
   -monitor respiratory status, vital signs
   -- might consider repeat echo
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation: Hx of inducible VT, s/p upgrade to a BiV ICD [**2121**]
   (defibrillated 1x).
   -holding coumadin
   -continue telemetry
   .
   # DMII: Diagnosed seven years ago, most recent HgA1C: 8.5% as of [**Month (only) 319**]
   [**2125**].
   -HISS
   - [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 851**] [**Location (un) 684**] of [**Last Name (un) 294**] folows his DM, as pt is on a study drug for
   kidney disease
   .
   #HTN: Currently stable though on low side with possible IVC compression
   from hematoma.  Will be cautious with antihypertensives in setting of
   bleed.
   - furosemide according to BP parameters
   -hold metoprolol and valsartan, reasses if needed
   .
   #Hypothyroidism: Stable, continue levothyroxine sodium 125 mcg
   .
   #Gout: continue allopurinol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   possibly hemoconcentrated on admission)
   - possible GI c/s re: UGI
   .
   (#) Retroperitoneal bleed: Differential diagnosis broad at this point.
   No recent trauma. Causes of RP bleed could include: renal maignancy,
   pyelonephritis +/- abscess, vascular disease, rupture of renal cyst.
   Subcapsular and intraparenchymal bleed makes intrinsic kidney etiology
   most likely. Exophytic lesion on upper pole noted on CT (12->22mm since
   [**2123**]) but unrelated to current bleed. Bleed most likely exacerbated by
   warfarin (although not supratherapeutic INR ~2.5) and daily baby
   aspirin (functional platelet abnormalities).  Urology is following.
   Decreased urine output is concerning for progression of bleed affecting
   renal perfusion, and Cr has bumped from 2.3 --> 4.5 overnight.
   -- will call urology this am to touch base about the decreased urine
   output
   -- will give another 2 units FFP given possible progression of bleed
   -- cont holding warfarin, aspirin
   -- would lke to give RBC transfusion, but will hold given volume
   .
   (#) ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: unclear what his baseline is (seems
   to be in mid 2's); acute change with minimal UOP in last few hours is
   concerning for progression of the hematoma compromising blood flow to
   the kidney or IVC; also has a mildly elevated lactate.
   -- will repeat pelvis CT scan
   -Continue calcitriol 0.25 mcg PO DAILY
   -- renal diet when restarted
   .
   (#) POSSIBLE AMI: ST changes on EKG ordered for eval of nausea (not CP,
   albeit pt is diabetic) were considered ""artifact"" by cards fellow and
   normalized on repeat EKG.
   -- CE ordered with am labs though low suspicion will be positive
   -- cont statin; hold ASA given bleed
   .
   (#) Fever/Leukocytosis -  WBC currently 13.6 with left shift. Infection
   is highest on differential, although stress reaction to acute bleed,
   inflammatory, and neoplastic disease are also possible. No evidence fo
   PNA currently (though may have had an aspirtaion event last night).
   -- continue to monitor
   -- Check urine culture, blood culture
   .
   # CHF (h/o systolic dysfunction, though normalized on [**2123**] echo): Pt
   reports history of mild edema and recent weight gain. Known systolic
   dysfunction although LVEF in [**2123**] >55%.
   -Strict I's and O's
   -monitor respiratory status, vital signs
   -- might consider repeat echo
   .
   #Atrial fibrillation: Hx of inducible VT, s/p upgrade to a BiV ICD [**2121**]
   (defibrillated 1x).
   -holding coumadin
   -continue telemetry

   #HTN: Currently stable though on low side with possible IVC compression
   from hematoma.  Will be cautious with antihypertensives in setting of
   bleed.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old man with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, atrial fibrillation, and systolic heart failure who was admitted to the ICU with acute onset of right-sided flank pain, hypoxia, and possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He has a perirenal bleed possibly related to a renal cyst, and his condition is complicated by acute kidney injury, oliguria/anuria, and chronic kidney disease. He also has atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and gout.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progressive Renal Failure: The patient's acute kidney injury is worsening, with a creatinine level of 4.5 mg/dL. He has a high risk of developing chronic kidney disease and may require dialysis.
2. UGIB: The patient has a history of nausea and vomiting, and his gastric contents are positive for guaiac. He may be at risk for further bleeding, and prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent aspiration.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and systolic heart failure, and his condition may be exacerbated by the acute kidney injury. He may require further cardiac monitoring and treatment.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he has a left shift on his differential. He may be at risk for infection, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of his symptoms.
5. Bleeding Complications: The patient has a perirenal bleed, and his international normalized ratio (INR) is elevated. He may be at risk for further bleeding, and prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent complications.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient has bilateral pulmonary edema on his chest X-ray, and his oxygen saturation is 91%. He may require further respiratory support, and his condition should be closely monitored.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's mental status is altered, and he may be at risk for further neurological complications. He should be closely monitored for any changes in his mental status.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has a history of nausea and vomiting, and his gastric contents are positive for guaiac. He may be at risk for further gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration or gastrointestinal bleeding.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. He should be continued on oxygen therapy, and his fluid status should be closely monitored. He should also be continued on diuretics to manage his volume overload. His cardiac status should be closely monitored, and he should be continued on anticoagulation therapy to prevent further bleeding. His gastrointestinal symptoms should be managed with antiemetics and prophylactic measures to prevent aspiration. His neurological status should be closely monitored, and he should be continued on antiplatelet therapy to prevent further bleeding. His respiratory status should be closely monitored, and he should be continued on respiratory support as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
 ANXIETY:  Still think this is a sigificant component of anxiety,
   possible sundowning contributing to decompensations at night.  Consider
   Geriatrics consult to help guide us on this.
 OLIGURIA/ANURIA:  Gently IVF hydration overnight.  Given urine
   electrolytes with Na < 10, this is likely prerenal.  Gentle hydration
   as she still has poor po intake.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):  Now looks like sinus bradycardia.
   Discontinue amiodarone as per cardiology.   Hold on starting diltiazem
   for now. On IV heparin, PTT 104, held and decreased dose.  Repeat PTT
   this afternoon.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Pulmonary edema in
   setting of significant MR, diastolic dysfunction and suboptimal
   afterload reduction.  Appears comforable sitting up at ~45 degrees in
   bed.  Continues on hydralazine and isordil.  Try to increase
   hydralazine.  Hold on diruesis as we adjust her meds.  Continues to
   have tenuous respiratory status.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Continue patch.  No
   complaint of pain.
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE:
 PULMONARY EDEMA: Increased Fi02 requirements in setting of anxiety,
   hypertension.  Likely related to exacerbation of her underlying
   diastolic dysfunction.  CXR not significantly changed.  Had increased
   hydralazine dosing yesterday, continue 75 QID.  Will continue to
   monitor in ICU given labile blood pressures and escalating Fi02
   requirements.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Now on standing haldol dose
   per psychiatry service.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Cr stable 3.8. Repeat urine lytes.
   Continue to monitor as we increase her afterload reduction as above.

 ANEMA:  More than adequate bump to transfusion 1 u pRBCs yesterday.
   Spuriously low.  Guaiac all stools on heparin.  Check daily hct.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 ANXIETY:  Still think this is a sigificant component of anxiety,
   possible sundowning contributing to decompensations at night.  Consider
   Geriatrics consult to help guide us on this.
 OLIGURIA/ANURIA:  Gently IVF hydration overnight.  Given urine
   electrolytes with Na < 10, this is likely prerenal.  Gentle hydration
   as she still has poor po intake.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):  Now looks like sinus bradycardia.
   Discontinue amiodarone as per cardiology.   Hold on starting diltiazem
   for now. On IV heparin, PTT 104, held and decreased dose.  Repeat PTT
   this afternoon.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]):  Pulmonary edema in
   setting of significant MR, diastolic dysfunction and suboptimal
   afterload reduction.  Appears comforable sitting up at ~45 degrees in
   bed.  Continues on hydralazine and isordil.  Try to increase
   hydralazine.  Hold on diruesis as we adjust her meds.  Continues to
   have tenuous respiratory status.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN): Continue patch.  No
   complaint of pain.
 H/O HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, ACUTE:
 PULMONARY EDEMA: Increased Fi02 requirements in setting of anxiety,
   hypertension.  Likely related to exacerbation of her underlying
   diastolic dysfunction.  CXR not significantly changed.  Had increased
   hydralazine dosing yesterday, continue 75 QID.  Will continue to
   monitor in ICU given labile blood pressures and escalating Fi02
   requirements.

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Now on standing haldol dose
   per psychiatry service.
 ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE:  Cr stable 3.8. Repeat urine lytes.
   Continue to monitor as we increase her afterload reduction as above.

 ANEMA:  More than adequate bump to transfusion 1 u pRBCs yesterday.
   Spuriously low.  Guaiac all stools on heparin.  Check daily hct.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The patient's condition has been unstable, with significant anxiety, hypertension, and increasing Fi02 requirements. Overnight, the patient's anxiety increased, leading to worsening hypertension, which was managed with Ativan. The patient's respiratory status remains tenuous, with pulmonary edema and diastolic dysfunction contributing to the exacerbation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, may recur due to discontinuation of amiodarone and hold on starting diltiazem.
	* Hypertension may worsen, leading to cardiac failure or ischemia.
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Pulmonary edema may progress, leading to respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
	* Increased Fi02 requirements may indicate worsening respiratory status.
3. Renal Complications:
	* Prerenal oliguria/anuria may persist, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
	* Hydration management is crucial to prevent further kidney damage.
4. Neurological Complications:
	* Anxiety and altered mental status may worsen, leading to delirium or agitation.
	* Increased risk of seizures or status epilepticus due to hydralazine and other medications.
5. Hematological Complications:
	* Anemia may worsen due to ongoing bleeding or transfusion requirements.
	* Increased risk of bleeding complications due to heparin and other anticoagulant medications.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Stress ulceration may occur due to increased stress and corticosteroid use.
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding may occur due to increased risk of bleeding complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition, adjust medications as needed, and consider consults from various specialties to optimize care and prevent potential complications."

   77 yof with continued resistant HTN in setting of pulmonary edema,
   fluid overload poor renal function and delirium.
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  due to pulmonary edema [**12-24**] to MR
   exacerbated by elevated [**Doctor Last Name **] and worsening renal function.  Patient
   continues to experience dyspnea in the setting of agitation AND labile
   hypertension.  Cr stable to 4.0 and patient appears clinically dry.
   - continue metoprolol 100 TID, ISMN 30 [**Hospital1 **], Clonodine patch,
   Hydralazine 25 QID
   - consider adding low dose a-1 blocker
   - consider bronchoscopy for evaluation of worsening RL fields with
   possible collapse
   - hold on lasix as patient is negative for LOS and clinically dry
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  likely resulted from MR and element
   of decompensated HF. Amiodarone was initially started but then
   discontinued for concern of QTc prolongation in a/w anti-psychotics.
   Note that NSR may revert back to AF with RVR once Amiodarone washes
   out.
   - continue metoprolol 100 TID for rate control, if this is not
   sufficient consider adding additional nodal [**Doctor Last Name 23**] like CCB or Digoxin
   - clarify goals of care with son concerning anticoagulation - consider
   DC heparin drip as patient is now in sinus
 patient was in
   intermittent AF with RVR x 4 days which is minimal RF for clot

   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - afterload reduction as documented above.
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure: patient continues have stable Cr
   with now decr. UOP.  Patient  appears clinically dry.
   - avoid continued diuresis
   ##. Agitation:  continue Seroquel 25 [**Doctor Last Name **] with 12.5 q 6 PRN for

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Acute on chronic renal failure
* Agitation
* Delirium

The patient's medications include:

* Metoprolol 100 mg three times a day
* ISMN 30 mg once a day
* Clonidine patch
* Hydralazine 25 mg four times a day
* Furosemide (Lasix) 40 mg every 12 hours
* Amlodipine 10 mg once a day
* Seroquel 25 mg every 6 hours as needed
* Remeron 15 mg once a day
* Ativan 1 mg every 8 hours as needed

* Pneumonia
* Sepsis
* Cardiac arrest
* Respiratory failure
* Renal failure
* Electrolyte imbalance
* Hypotension
* Hypertension
* Arrhythmias
* Delirium
* Agitation

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continue metoprolol 100 mg three times a day for rate control
* Consider adding a low-dose alpha-blocker
* Hold furosemide (Lasix) due to the patient's negative fluid balance
* Consider bronchoscopy for evaluation of worsening right lung fields with possible collapse
* Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and replete as needed
* Continue to manage the patient's agitation and delirium with Seroquel and Remeron
* Consider switching to Remeron in the setting of poor oral intake and continued agitation
* Continue to follow geriatrics recommendations concerning management of delirium

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  likely resulted from MR and element
   of decompensated HF. Amiodarone was initially started but then
   discontinued for concern of QTc prolongation in a/w anti-psychotics.
   Note that NSR may revert back to AF with RVR once Amiodarone washes

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male admitted with resistant hypertension, dyspnea, and fluid overload. He has a history of right subclavian stenosis and is currently on BiPAP due to persistent hypoxia. His condition has worsened, with increasing white-out of the right lung, concerning for partial collapse. He has labile hypertension, agitation, and delirium, and is at risk for respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and acute on chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory distress and hypoxia increase the risk of respiratory failure, which could lead to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function and decreasing urine output increase the risk of acute kidney injury, which could lead to further decline in renal function and require dialysis.
4. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's labile hypertension increases the risk of hypertensive crisis, which could lead to cerebral edema, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Delirium: The patient's delirium increases the risk of falls, medication errors, and other complications, and may worsen his overall condition.
6. Partial lung collapse: The patient's worsening white-out of the right lung increases the risk of partial lung collapse, which could lead to respiratory failure and decreased lung function.
7. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema increases the risk of respiratory failure, which could lead to intubation and mechanical ventilation.
8. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, which could lead to cardiac arrest and death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue BiPAP and optimize oxygen therapy to improve oxygenation.
2. Manage hypertension with medications and close monitoring of blood pressure.
3. Monitor and manage atrial fibrillation with rate control and anticoagulation.
4. Continue renal replacement therapy and monitor urine output.
5. Manage delirium with sedation, reorientation, and close monitoring.
6. Monitor and manage partial lung collapse with chest radiographs and bronchoscopy.
7. Continue pulmonary edema management with diuretics and oxygen therapy.
8. Monitor and manage cardiac arrhythmias with close monitoring and anti-arrhythmic medications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis, admitted with dyspnea, fluid overload, and poorly controlled hypertension. He continues to experience substantial respiratory distress associated with anxiety and elevated blood pressure. The patient was placed back on BiPAP overnight for persistent hypoxia and now has worsening CXR and decreasing urine output.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.1°C (97°F)
* Heart rate: 50 bpm (48-63)
* Blood pressure: 168/46 mmHg (85-235/29-135)
* Respiratory rate: 24 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus bradycardia

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 6.6-10.3 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 8.8-10.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 375-477 K/μL
* Creatinine: 3.8-4.0 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: potassium 3.6-4.0 mmol/L, sodium 134-136 mmol/L, magnesium 1.9-2.1 mmol/L, phosphate 4.0-4.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 104-184 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* LDH: 180 IU/L

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CXR: worsening opacity in the right lower and middle lobes, concerning for partial collapse of the right lung
* ABG: pH 7.38, pCO2 42 mmHg, pO2 67 mmHg, HCO3 24 mmol/L

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: due to pulmonary edema exacerbated by elevated blood pressure and worsening renal function.
2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: likely resulting from mitral regurgitation and decompensated heart failure.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: patient has stable creatinine levels but decreasing urine output, and appears clinically dry.
4. Agitation: patient is experiencing agitation and delirium, which may be exacerbated by hypertension, hypoxia, and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Pulmonary edema: patient has worsening CXR and decreasing urine output, which may indicate continued fluid overload.

Recommendations:

1. Continue current anti-hypertensive regimen, as systolic hypertension is maximally afterload-reduced and unlikely to improve further.
2. Continue BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort.
3. Defer diuresis as pulmonary edema is likely due to abnormal physiology and fluid overload.
4. Continue metoprolol for rate control, and consider adding additional nodal agents like CCB or digoxin if necessary.
5. Clarify goals of care with the patient's son, including anticoagulation needs and consideration of phaeochromocytoma.
6. Continue anti-delirium medications, including Seroquel and Remeron, and monitor for side effects.
7. Monitor for signs of worsening respiratory failure, including increased respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, and increased lung opacities.
8. Consider switching to Remeron in the setting of poor PO intake and continued agitation.
9. Continue to follow geriatric recommendations for management of delirium, including attempts to normalize sleep-wake cycles."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis, admitted with dyspnea, fluid overload, and poorly controlled systolic hypertension. She is currently in the ICU with continued issues with pulmonary edema and respiratory support. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 215/64 mmHg, heart rate of 62 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is currently in sinus rhythm. Her renal function is impaired, and she has a creatinine level of 3.8 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and resistant systolic hypertension may exacerbate her hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring continued respiratory support.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias and hemodynamic instability.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's impaired renal function may worsen her electrolyte imbalance and increase her risk of acidosis, hyperkalemia, and other complications.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium may exacerbate her agitation, hypertension, and respiratory distress, requiring continued sedation and close monitoring.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload may worsen her pulmonary edema and increase her risk of cardiac failure, requiring continued diuresis and fluid management.
6. Hypertension: The patient's resistant hypertension may increase her risk of cardiac complications, including cardiac failure, arrhythmias, and stroke.
7. Metabolic Complications: The patient's impaired renal function and diabetes mellitus type II may increase her risk of metabolic complications, including hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, and acidosis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue respiratory support with BiPAP and consider additional diuresis to manage pulmonary edema.
2. Monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response closely and consider adding anti-arrhythmic medications.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with hydralazine and consider adding additional anti-hypertensive medications.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider adding diuretics to manage fluid overload.
5. Continue to manage the patient's delirium with sedation and close monitoring.
6. Consider transferring the patient to a medical care unit once stable.
7. Review the patient's goals of care with her family and consider discussing DNR/DNI status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:  77 yof with h/o resistant HTN, DM-II right subclavian
   stenosis admited with dyspnea, fluid overload and poorly controlled
   systolic HTN.  She is maximally afterload reduced, fluid negative but
   continues to have issues with pulmonary edema and respiratory support.

The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. She was admitted with dyspnea, fluid overload, and poorly controlled systolic hypertension. Despite being maximally afterload-reduced and fluid-negative, she continues to experience issues with pulmonary edema and requires respiratory support. Her current medications include hydralazine, nitroglycerin, heparin, and morphine. She has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and her current heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 436 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 25 mEq/L
* Sodium: 132 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.0 mEq/L
* Calcium: 8.4 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.9 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* LDH: 180 IU/L
* Troponin-T: 0.07 ng/mL

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema is likely to worsen due to her resistant systolic hypertension, poor renal function, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory failure if her pulmonary edema worsens.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increases her risk of cardiac arrest.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen if her blood pressure is not controlled, and her kidney function is not improved.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of central lines increase her risk of infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).
6. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen if her sleep-wake cycle is not regulated, and her agitation is not managed.
7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and her history of atrial fibrillation increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is likely to worsen if her pulmonary edema is not managed, and her blood pressure is not controlled. Therefore, it is essential to continue her current medications, including hydralazine, nitroglycerin, and heparin. Additionally, the patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response should be managed with rate control medications, and her delirium should be managed with sedation and regulation of her sleep-wake cycle. The patient's goals of care should be discussed with her son, and a family meeting should be held to clarify her code status and advance directives."

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yof with continued resistant HTN in setting of pulmonary edema, poor
   renal function and delirium.
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  due to pulmonary edema [**12-24**] to MR
   exacerbated by resistant systolic HTN and worsening renal function.
   Patient continues to experience dyspnea in the setting of agitation AND
   labile hypertension.  Cr stable, now to 3.8.  Patient has resistant
   systolic HTN and patient is maximally [**Doctor Last Name **] reduced as evidenced by low
   diastolic BP and we are unlikely to improve on this.
   - continue current HTN regimine with PRN hydralazine for BP > 200
   - continue BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort
   - defer additional diuresis as pulmonary edema  likely results from her
   physiology and not fluid status, she remains
 7 L for LOS and
   clinically dry with continued pulmonary edema and non-invassive
   requirements
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  likely resulted from MR and element
   of decompensated HF. Amiodarone was initially started but then
   discontinued for concern of QTc prolongation in a/w anti-psychotics.
   Note that NSR may revert back to AF with RVR once Amiodarone washes
   out.  Patient is currently in NSR.
   - continue metoprolol 100 TID for rate control, if this is not
   sufficient consider adding additional nodal [**Doctor Last Name 23**] like CCB or Digoxin
   - clarify goals of care with son
 issue of anticoagulation needs to be
   address
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 240
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - continue anti-HTN regimine as discussed above
   - - f/u metanephrines for consideration of pheo
 this seems unlikely
   given normal HR and lack of additional stigmata a/w catecholamine
   excess
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure: patient continues have improving Cr
   with sufficient UOP.  Patient  appears clinically  dry and patient is
   7L for [**Location 4982**] goal I & O
s are even today
   ##. Agitation:  patient continues to suffer from delirium with abnormal
   sleep wake cycles which exacerbates the underlying hypertension.
   - continue Seroquel 25 mg PO at 7 PM with additional 12.5 mg if not
   asleep by 12 AM in attempt to regulate sleep wake cycle
   - continue to follow Geriatrics recs
   ##. Goals of care
 hopeful family meeting today to discuss GOC with
   son, patient may not fully understand the implications of DNR/DNI.
   Renal is aware and is available to attend.
   ##. FEN: PRN repletion

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yof with continued resistant HTN in setting of pulmonary edema, poor
   renal function and delirium.
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  due to pulmonary edema [**12-24**] to MR
   exacerbated by resistant systolic HTN and worsening renal function.
   Patient continues to experience dyspnea in the setting of agitation AND
   labile hypertension.  Cr stable, now to 3.8.  Patient has resistant
   systolic HTN and patient is maximally [**Doctor Last Name **] reduced as evidenced by low
   diastolic BP and we are unlikely to improve on this.
   - continue current HTN regimine with PRN hydralazine for BP > 200
   - continue BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort
   - defer additional diuresis as pulmonary edema  likely results from her
   physiology and not fluid status, she remains
 7 L for LOS and
   clinically dry with continued pulmonary edema and non-invassive
   requirements
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  likely resulted from MR and element
   of decompensated HF. Amiodarone was initially started but then
   discontinued for concern of QTc prolongation in a/w anti-psychotics.
   Note that NSR may revert back to AF with RVR once Amiodarone washes
   out.  Patient is currently in NSR.
   - continue metoprolol 100 TID for rate control, if this is not
   sufficient consider adding additional nodal [**Doctor Last Name 23**] like CCB or Digoxin
   - clarify goals of care with son

   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120

   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - continue anti-HTN regimine as discussed above
   - - f/u metanephrines for consideration of pheo

   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure: patient continues have improving Cr
   with sufficient UOP.  Patient  appears clinically  dry and patient is
   7L for [**Location 4982**] goal I & O
s are even today
   ##. Agitation:  patient continues to suffer from delirium with abnormal
   sleep wake cycles which exacerbates the underlying hypertension.
   - continue Seroquel 25 mg PO at 7 PM with additional 12.5 mg if not
   asleep by 12 AM in attempt to regulate sleep wake cycle
   - continue to follow Geriatrics recs

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes, and right subclavian stenosis, admitted with dyspnea, fluid overload, and poorly controlled systolic hypertension. Despite maximal afterload reduction and fluid negativity, she continues to experience pulmonary edema and respiratory support. The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypertension, acute on chronic renal failure, and agitation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response increase the risk of hypoxic respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and hypertension increase the risk of cardiac arrest.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased risk of falls, respiratory complications, and cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Infection: The patient's respiratory support and central venous lines increase the risk of infection.
6. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and hypertension increase the risk of bleeding.
7. Metabolic Complications: The patient's diabetes and hypertension may lead to metabolic complications such as hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's hypertension and fluid overload may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to optimize the patient's respiratory support and fluid management to reduce the risk of hypoxic respiratory failure and cardiac arrest.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and electrolyte levels to prevent arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
3. Manage the patient's hypertension and renal function to prevent further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Continue to manage the patient's delirium and agitation with sedation and behavioral interventions.
5. Monitor the patient's infection risk and take measures to prevent infection, such as maintaining proper hand hygiene and using sterile equipment.
6. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and take measures to prevent bleeding, such as monitoring platelet counts and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's metabolic and gastrointestinal status and take measures to prevent complications, such as adjusting insulin therapy and providing anti-emetic medications.
8. Discuss the patient's goals of care with her son and ensure that they are aligned with her wishes."

   exacerbated by elevated [**Doctor Last Name **] and worsening renal function.  Patient
   continues to experience dyspnea in the setting of agitation AND labile
   hypertension.  Cr stable to 4.0 and patient appears clinically dry.
   - continue current anti-HTn regimine
 this is systolic HTN and patient
   is maximally afterload reduced as evidenced by low diastolic BP and it
   is unlikely we can improve on this
   - continue BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort
   - defer diuresis as pulmonary edema is do to abnormal physiology and

   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  likely resulted from MR and element
   of decompensated HF. Amiodarone was initially started but then
   discontinued for concern of QTc prolongation in a/w anti-psychotics.
   Note that NSR may revert back to AF with RVR once Amiodarone washes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   77 yof with continued resistant HTN in setting of pulmonary edema,
   fluid overload poor renal function and delirium.
   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  due to pulmonary edema [**12-24**] to MR
   exacerbated by elevated [**Doctor Last Name **] and worsening renal function.  Patient
   continues to experience dyspnea in the setting of agitation AND labile
   hypertension.  Cr stable to 4.0 and patient appears clinically dry.
   - continue current anti-HTn regimine
 this is systolic HTN and patient
   is maximally afterload reduced as evidenced by low diastolic BP and it
   is unlikely we can improve on this
   - continue BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort
   - defer diuresis as pulmonary edema is do to abnormal physiology and
   likely note fluid overload
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  likely resulted from MR and element
   of decompensated HF. Amiodarone was initially started but then
   discontinued for concern of QTc prolongation in a/w anti-psychotics.
   Note that NSR may revert back to AF with RVR once Amiodarone washes
   out.
   - continue metoprolol 100 TID for rate control, if this is not
   sufficient consider adding additional nodal [**Doctor Last Name 23**] like CCB or Digoxin
   - clarify goals of care with son
 issue of anticoagulation needs to be
   addressed
   - f.u metanephrines for consideration of pheo
   ##. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 240
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delerium; improved with sedation
   - continue anti-HTN regimine as discussed above
   ##. Acute on chronic renal failure: patient continues have stable Cr
   with now decr. UOP.  Patient  appears clinically  dry and patient is
   nearly 6L negative for [**Location 4982**] keep patient even today
   ##. Agitation:  continue Seroquel 25 qHS with 12.5 q 6 PRN for
   agitation.  Consider switching to Remeron in setting of poor PO intake
   and continued agitation.  DC HALDOL.  And NO PRN ATIVAN.
   - continue to follow geriatrics recommendations concerning management
   of delirium
 attempting to normalize sleep wake cycle
   - recommendations are very much valued and appreciated
   ##. Goals of care
 contact family today for clarification, we are not
   sure what more we have to offer and do not feel we will be able to fix
   the pulmonary edema.  This needs to be made clear to the son.

   ##. Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  due to pulmonary edema [**12-24**] to MR
   exacerbated by resistant systolic HTN and worsening renal function.
   Patient continues to experience dyspnea in the setting of agitation AND
   labile hypertension.  Cr stable, now to 3.8.  Patient has resistant
   systolic HTN and patient is maximally [**Doctor Last Name **] reduced as evidenced by low
   diastolic BP and we are unlikely to improve on this.
   - continue current HTN regimine with PRN hydralazine for BP > 200
   - continue BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort
   - defer additional diuresis as pulmonary edema  likely results from her
   physiology and not fluid status, she remains
 7 L for LOS and
   clinically dry with continued pulmonary edema and non-invassive
   requirements
   ## Atrial Fibrillation with RVR:  likely resulted from MR and element
   of decompensated HF. Amiodarone was initially started but then
   discontinued for concern of QTc prolongation in a/w anti-psychotics.
   Note that NSR may revert back to AF with RVR once Amiodarone washes
   out.  Patient is currently in NSR.
   - continue metoprolol 100 TID for rate control, if this is not

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old woman admitted with dyspnea, fluid overload, and poorly controlled systolic hypertension. She has a history of resistant hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and right subclavian stenosis. Despite being maximally afterload reduced and fluid negative, the patient continues to experience pulmonary edema and requires respiratory support. The patient's condition is complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute on chronic renal failure, and agitation with delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's continued pulmonary edema is a significant concern, and further diuresis may not be effective in resolving this issue.
2. Hypertensive Crisis: The patient's labile hypertension is a risk factor for hypertensive crisis, which could worsen her condition.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure may worsen if not managed properly, leading to further complications.
4. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
5. Delirium: The patient's agitation and delirium may worsen her condition and increase the risk of complications.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's continued respiratory support may be necessary to manage her pulmonary edema, but this may also increase the risk of respiratory failure.
7. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of invasive lines and tubes may increase the risk of infection.
8. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's underlying cardiovascular disease and hypertension may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's pulmonary edema and adjust treatment as necessary.
2. Manage the patient's hypertension with a combination of medications and lifestyle changes.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment as necessary.
4. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of her atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.
5. Continue to manage the patient's delirium with a combination of medications and non-pharmacological interventions.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory function and adjust treatment as necessary.
7. Consider referring the patient to an infectious disease specialist for further evaluation and management of any potential infections.
8. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of any potential cardiovascular complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old individual with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the ICU due to resistant hypertension, pulmonary edema, poor renal function, and delirium.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate of 56 beats per minute, and blood pressure ranging from 182/46 mmHg to 230/76 mmHg. Respiratory support is provided through nasal cannula and high-flow neb, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 95%. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 98%.

Laboratory results show worsening renal function, with a creatinine level of 3.8 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 27.4 mg/dL. The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 10.3 K/uL, and the platelet count is 436 K/uL.

The patient has a history of resistant hypertension, and their blood pressure is not well-controlled despite maximal medical therapy. They have also developed acute on chronic renal failure, with a creatinine level that is increasing despite adequate urine output.

The patient's agitation and delirium are ongoing, and they are being treated with sedation and antipsychotics. They have a history of resistant systolic hypertension, and their blood pressure is often labile, ranging from 120/240 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening renal function: The patient's creatinine level is increasing, and their BUN level is high, indicating worsening renal function. This can lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and end-stage renal disease.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema and hypoxic respiratory failure can worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's resistant hypertension and poor renal function can lead to cardiovascular complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.
4. Infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospitalization can increase their risk of developing infections, including pneumonia, sepsis, and urinary tract infections.
5. Delirium and agitation: The patient's ongoing delirium and agitation can lead to further complications such as falls, pressure ulcers, and worsening hypertension.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and risk of stress ulceration can lead to further complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, and sepsis.

In summary, the patient is at high risk for further complications due to their complex medical history and ongoing medical issues. Close monitoring and management of their condition are necessary to prevent or mitigate these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of resistant hypertension, pulmonary edema, poor renal function, and delirium. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and is currently in normal sinus rhythm.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 98.6°F (37°C)
* Heart rate: 56 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 197/52 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Spontaneous ventilation: 312 mL

The patient is receiving several medications, including:

* Heparin sodium
* Morphine sulfate
* Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)
* Metoprolol
* Seroquel
* Lasix (Furosemide)
* Amiodarone (discontinued due to concern of QTc prolongation)

The patient has several medical complications, including:

* Hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema
* Resistant systolic hypertension
* Worsening renal function
* Delirium
* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 10.3-10.9 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 30.6-30.9%
* Platelet count: 477-436 K/uL
* Creatinine: 3.8-4.0 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 70-104 mg/dL
* Glucose: 151-218 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.2 mmol/L
* LDH: 180 IU/L
* Calcium: 8.4-8.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.8-2.1 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.9-4.1 mg/dL

The patient's disposition is as follows:

* The patient is now DNR/DNI and palliative care is making arrangements for home BIPAP with dilaudid PCA to help with air hunger with home hospice arrangements.
* The patient is to continue current hypertension regimen with PRN hydralazine for BP > 200.
* The patient is to continue BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort.
* The patient is to defer additional diuresis as pulmonary edema is likely due to her physiology and not fluid status.
* The patient is to continue metoprolol 100 TID for rate control.
* The patient is to defer anticoagulation as not contraindicated with long-term warfarin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening respiratory failure
* Increased risk of bleeding due to prolonged anticoagulation
* Development of acute kidney injury due to continued hypertension and poor renal function
* Increased risk of arrhythmias due to underlying atrial fibrillation and potential QTc prolongation
* Continued delirium and agitation, potentially exacerbating hypertension and respiratory failure
* Potential for further decline in cardiac function due to continued hypertension and poor renal function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yof with continued resistant HTN in setting of pulmonary edema, poor
   renal function and delirium.
   # Disposition: now DNR/DNI with palliative care making arrangements for
   home BIPAP and dilaudid PCA with home hospice
   #. Hypoxic Respiratory failure: due to pulmonary edema [**12-24**] to MR
   exacerbated by resistant systolic HTN and poor renal function. Patient
   continues to experience dyspnea in the setting of agitation AND labile
   hypertension.  Patient has resistant systolic HTN and is maximally [**Doctor Last Name **]
   reduced as evidenced by low diastolic BP and we are unable to improve
   BP control.
   - continue current HTN regimine
   - continue BiPAP for adequate oxygenation and comfort
   - defer additional diuresis as pulmonary edema results from physiology
   and not fluid status
   # AF with RVR:  likely resulted from MR with element of decompensated
   HF. Amiodarone initially started but then discontinued for concern of
   QTc prolongation w/ anti-psychotics. Patient is currently in NSR.
   - continue metoprolol 100 TID for rate and BP control
   - defer anticoagulation as not c/w long term GOC
   #. HTN: patient with h/o resistant hypertension with very labile
   pressures ranging from 120
 240
s systolic often exacerbated by
   agitation and delirium and improved with sedation
   - continue anti-HTN regimine as discussed above
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: patient continues have improving Cr
   with sufficient UOP.  Patient  appears clinically  dry and patient is
   -8.5L for [**Location 4982**] defer additional diuresis
   #. Agitation:  patient continues to suffer from delirium with abnormal
   sleep wake cycles which exacerbates the underlying hypertension.
   - continue Seroquel 25 mg PO at 7 PM with additional 12.5 mg if not
   asleep by 12 AM in attempt to regulate sleep wake cycle
   - update Geriatrics re: goals of care

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resistant hypertension, pulmonary edema, poor renal function, and delirium. He is currently in the ICU with hypoxic respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema exacerbated by resistant systolic hypertension and poor renal function. The patient is maximally reduced as evidenced by low diastolic blood pressure, and BP control is not achievable. He is experiencing dyspnea and agitation, and has labile hypertension. The patient has been started on palliative care, and arrangements are being made for home BIPAP and dilaudid PCA with home hospice.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure is likely to worsen if not managed properly, leading to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's resistant hypertension and poor renal function increase the risk of cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is likely to worsen if not managed properly, leading to further renal dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely to exacerbate his underlying hypertension and respiratory failure, and may lead to further complications such as falls, pressure ulcers, and infections.
5. Infections: The patient's immunosuppressed state increases the risk of infections, which could be life-threatening if not managed properly.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's poor nutritional status and lack of bowel regularity increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, and hemorrhage.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's labile hypertension and hypotension increase the risk of hemodynamic instability, which could lead to further complications such as cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and renal failure."
