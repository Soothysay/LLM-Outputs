   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old female with PMH of DM2, CHF, s/p PPM in [**2148**], chronic LE
   edema who presented to the ED after a visiting nurse found her to be
   febrile.
   .
   # Sepsis/Pneumonia: Patient has RUL infiltrate on CXR with [**Year (4 digits) **] and
   elevated white count. As she has no recent hospital admissions, this is
   likely a community acquired pneumonia. No history of aspiration. Pt is
   edentulous. Patient was transiently hypotensive in the ED, which
   resolved after 1.5L of IVF. Lactate=1.6 and the patient is currently
   normotensive, indicating that this is not severe sepsis. Overnight, BP
   continued to remain low. Temperature increased to 100.8 overnight and
   WBC has increased this morning to 14.1.
   - Blood cultures x2 pending
   - Continue on Levofloxacin as coverage for presumed CAP
   - Add Vancomycin for MRSA coverage
   - IVF Bolus for hypotension/low UOP
   - Send sputum for culture
   - If patient's fluid and O2 requirements increase, consider
   arterial/central line for hemodynamic monitoring as needed.
   - hold antihypertensives, including b-blocker, ace, Lasix
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has history of systolic CHF with EF=30%
   on [**2152-9-22**]. BNP=[**Numeric Identifier 1756**] in ED. Her baseline is not known. CXR on
   admission is inconsistent with a CHF exacerbation. Patient received
   1.5L IVF in the ED. AM CXR is also inconsistent with CHF exacerbation.
   Patient not complaining of shortness of breath.
   - Will monitor daily CXR and physical exam to assess acute exacerbation
   - Goal is for even fluid balance given comorbid chronic kidney disease
   - Patient on home lasix
 will hold for now as BP remains low with low
   UOP
   - Will restart beta blocker, ACE inhibitor tomorrow depending on BP
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Cr=1.3, BUN=27. Patient has baseline of approx
   1.3 over the past year. With BUN/Cr ratio >20, this may also be
   pre-renal. Patient has already received NS. There may possibly be
   underlying chronic kidney disease - either secondary to diabetes or
   poor cardiac output/chronic Lasix therapy. Will monitor daily labs to
   follow Cr, BUN, which remain stable this morning.
   - If drop in uop or rise in creat, w/u for ARF including urine lytes
   and bolus as needed.
   .
   # Left Leg Ulcer: Appears superficial without substantial erythema.
   Wound care with antibiotic ointment, moist barrier w/ sterile gauze.
   Consider wound c/s if worsening.
   .
   # Bacturia: Patient's UA in the ED showed many bacteria with few WBC
   and negative Leuk esterase. This likely represents asymptomatic
   bacturia.
   - Await urine culture
   - No intervention indicated at this time
   .
   # DM2: Hyperglycemic on admission. Hold glipizide. HgbA1c=7.5% on
   [**2153-9-6**]. Start regular insulin sliding scale.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Patient taking synthroid. Will continue.
   .
   # PPx: SC heparin, PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes, chronic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted to the ICU due to a multi-lumen infiltrate on chest X-ray, hypotension, and a white blood cell count of 14.1.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.8°F, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 95/52 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is receiving Levofloxacin and Vancomycin for presumed community-acquired pneumonia, and IV fluids for hypotension.

The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, with an ejection fraction of 30%. Her baseline BNP is not known, but her current BNP is elevated. She is not complaining of shortness of breath, and her CXR is inconsistent with a heart failure exacerbation.

The patient also has chronic kidney disease, with a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL and a BUN level of 27 mg/dL. Her BUN/Cr ratio is >20, which may indicate pre-renal azotemia.

The patient has a left leg ulcer that appears superficial and is being treated with antibiotic ointment and moist barrier dressing. She has asymptomatic bacteriuria, and a urine culture is pending.

The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, and she is being treated with regular insulin sliding scale. She has hypothyroidism and is taking Synthroid.

The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin for deep vein thrombosis and PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a high white blood cell count and a multi-lumen infiltrate on CXR, which may indicate sepsis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a suspected community-acquired pneumonia, which can progress to respiratory failure if not treated promptly.
3. Heart failure exacerbation: The patient has a history of chronic systolic heart failure, and her current BNP level is elevated. If her heart failure exacerbates, it can lead to respiratory failure and other complications.
4. Kidney injury: The patient has chronic kidney disease, and her current creatinine level is elevated. If her kidney function deteriorates further, it can lead to acute kidney injury and other complications.
5. Wound infection: The patient has a left leg ulcer that is being treated with antibiotic ointment and moist barrier dressing. If the wound becomes infected, it can lead to sepsis and other complications.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, and if it is not controlled, it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis and other complications.
7. Thyroid storm: The patient has hypothyroidism, and if her thyroid hormone levels are not controlled, it can lead to thyroid storm.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and prompt treatment are necessary to prevent these complications and ensure her recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with pneumonia (PNA), initially lobar, now appearing multifocal, and hypotensive. They have a history of chronic conditions, including CHF, CRF, and a left LE ulcer. They were recently diagnosed with hypothyroidism. The patient is receiving antibiotics, levofloxacin and flagyl, and will be switched to cover CAP and MRSA. They are also receiving vasopressors to manage hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's PNA is multifocal, which increases the risk of complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, and mortality.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be a sign of inadequate perfusion, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of CHF and CRF increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
4. Renal Complications: The patient's CRF increases the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease progression.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of chronic LE ulcer and recent diagnosis of hypothyroidism may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding and perforation.
6. Sepsis: The patient's multifocal PNA increases the risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
7. Vascular Complications: The patient's history of chronic LE ulcer and hypothyroidism may increase the risk of vascular complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
8. Respiratory Complications: The patient's PNA may lead to respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure, and the need for mechanical ventilation.
9. Neurological Complications: The patient's hypotension and PNA may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, coma, and brain death.

Given the patient's complex medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, lab results, and clinical status to identify potential complications early and initiate appropriate interventions to prevent or manage them."

   continued to remain low. Temperature increased to 100.8 overnight and
   WBC has increased this morning to 14.1. Blood pressure dropped this
   morning during AM rounds. Patient given 250cc fluid bolus as well as
   Levophed drip.
   - Blood cultures x2 pending
   - Continue on Levofloxacin as coverage for presumed CAP
   - Add Vancomycin for MRSA coverage
   - IVF Bolus for hypotension/low UOP. Continue Levophed. Wean when able.
   - Send sputum for culture
   - Attempted arterial line.

   # Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has history of systolic CHF with EF=30%
   on [**2152-9-22**]. BNP=[**Numeric Identifier 1756**] in ED. Her baseline is not known. CXR on
   admission is inconsistent with a CHF exacerbation. Patient received
   1.5L IVF in the ED. AM CXR is also inconsistent with CHF exacerbation.
   Patient not complaining of shortness of breath.
   - Will monitor daily CXR and physical exam to assess acute exacerbation
   - Goal is for even fluid balance given comorbid chronic kidney disease
   - Patient on home lasix
 will hold for now as BP remains low with low
   UOP

   # Chronic Renal Failure: Cr=1.3, BUN=27. Patient has baseline of approx
   1.3 over the past year. With BUN/Cr ratio >20, this may also be
   pre-renal. Patient has already received NS. There may possibly be
   underlying chronic kidney disease - either secondary to diabetes or
   poor cardiac output/chronic Lasix therapy. Will monitor daily labs to
   follow Cr, BUN, which remain stable this morning.
   - If drop in uop or rise in creat, w/u for ARF including urine lytes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic heart failure, and a pacemaker. She was admitted to the ICU with a fever, infiltrate on CXR, and hypotension. She received 1.5L of IVF in the ED and was started on Levofloxacin for presumed community-acquired pneumonia. Her blood pressure remained low, and she was given a 250cc fluid bolus and a Levophed drip. She has a history of chronic kidney disease, and her creatinine is elevated. She also has a left leg ulcer that appears superficial.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis/Pneumonia: The patient's fever, infiltrate on CXR, and elevated white count suggest a possible community-acquired pneumonia. However, the patient's low blood pressure and tachycardia may indicate sepsis.
2. Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient's history of systolic CHF and elevated BNP level suggest that she may be at risk for CHF exacerbation.
3. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels suggest chronic kidney disease, which may be exacerbated by her diabetes and CHF.
4. Left Leg Ulcer: The patient's left leg ulcer may become infected, leading to cellulitis or osteomyelitis.
5. Bacturia: The patient's urine culture showed many bacteria with few WBC, which may indicate asymptomatic bacturia.
6. DM2: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen, leading to diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's recent prescription of synthroid may not be adequate, leading to hypothyroidism.
8. DVT: The patient's chronic kidney disease and CHF may increase her risk for DVT.
9. Stress ulcer: The patient's pneumonia and CHF may increase her risk for stress ulcer.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics for pneumonia and consider adding vancomycin for MRSA coverage.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust fluid management accordingly.
3. Monitor the patient's creatinine and BUN levels and adjust diuretic therapy as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's wound care and consider wound c/s if worsening.
5. Monitor the patient's urine culture and consider antibiotic therapy if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's thyroid function and adjust synthroid dose as needed.
8. Monitor the patient for signs of DVT and stress ulcer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old female with PMH of DM2, CHF, s/p PPM in [**2148**], chronic LE
   edema who presented to the ED after a visiting nurse found her to be
   febrile.
   .
   # Sepsis/Pneumonia: Patient has RUL infiltrate on CXR with fever on
   admission and elevated white count. Due to low blood pressure with SBP
   in the 80s at times, patient received an arterial line yesterday and
   levophed, which has subsequently been weaned due to higher BP. Patient
   given 250cc fluid bolus at 10pm for a MAP ~60. Culture data is positive
   for Legionella, which is covered by the levofloxacin which she has been
   receiving.
   - Blood cultures x2 pending
   - Continue on Levofloxacin as coverage for legionella
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA coverage
   - IVF Bolus for hypotension/low UOP.
   - Send sputum for culture
   - hold antihypertensives, including b-blocker, ace, Lasix
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has history of systolic CHF with EF=30%
   on [**2152-9-22**]. BNP=[**Numeric Identifier 1756**] in ED with unknown baseline. Multiple CXR are
   inconsistent with a CHF exacerbation. Patient not complaining of
   shortness of breath.
   - Will monitor daily CXR and physical exam to assess acute exacerbation
   - Goal is for even fluid balance given comorbid chronic kidney disease
   and hypotension
   - Patient on home lasix
 will hold for now as BP remains low with low
   UOP
   - Continue to hold beta blocker, ace inhibitor, lasix
   # Bacturia: Patient's UA in the ED showed many bacteria with few WBC
   and negative Leuk esterase. Urine culture grew >100k enterococcus. This
   is covered by vancomycin.
   - Continue vancomycin
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Patient has baseline of approx 1.3 over the
   past year. With BUN/Cr ratio >20, this may also be pre-renal. Patient
   has already received NS. There may possibly be underlying chronic
   kidney disease - either secondary to diabetes or poor cardiac
   output/chronic Lasix therapy. Will monitor daily labs to follow Cr,
   BUN, which remain stable this morning.
   - If drop in uop or rise in creat, w/u for ARF including urine lytes
   and bolus as needed.
   .
   # Left Leg Ulcer: Chronic issue. Appears superficial without
   substantial erythema. Wound care with antibiotic ointment, moist
   barrier w/ sterile gauze. Consider wound c/s if worsening.
   .
   # DM2: Hyperglycemic on admission. Hold glipizide. HgbA1c=7.5% on
   [**2153-9-6**]. Start regular insulin sliding scale.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Patient recently prescribed synthroid by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1792**].
   Will continue dose of 25 mcg daily.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old female with PMH of DM2, CHF, s/p PPM in [**2148**], chronic LE
   edema who presented to the ED after a visiting nurse found her to be
   febrile.
   .
   # Sepsis/Pneumonia: Patient has RUL infiltrate on CXR with fever on
   admission and elevated white count. Due to low blood pressure with SBP
   in the 80s at times, patient received an arterial line yesterday and
   levophed, which has subsequently been weaned due to higher BP. Patient
   given 250cc fluid bolus at 10pm for a MAP ~60. Culture data is positive
   for Legionella, which is covered by the levofloxacin which she has been
   receiving.
   - Blood cultures x2 pending
   - Continue on Levofloxacin as coverage for legionella
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA coverage
   - IVF Bolus for hypotension/low UOP.
   - Send sputum for culture
   - hold antihypertensives, including b-blocker, ace, Lasix
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has history of systolic CHF with EF=30%
   on [**2152-9-22**]. BNP=[**Numeric Identifier 1756**] in ED with unknown baseline. Multiple CXR are
   inconsistent with a CHF exacerbation. Patient not complaining of
   shortness of breath.
   - Will monitor daily CXR and physical exam to assess acute exacerbation
   - Goal is for even fluid balance given comorbid chronic kidney disease
   and hypotension
   - Patient on home lasix
 will hold for now as BP remains low with low
   UOP
   - Continue to hold beta blocker, ace inhibitor, lasix
   # Bacturia: Patient's UA in the ED showed many bacteria with few WBC
   and negative Leuk esterase. Urine culture grew >100k enterococcus. This
   is covered by vancomycin.
   - Continue vancomycin
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Patient has baseline of approx 1.3 over the
   past year. With BUN/Cr ratio >20, this may also be pre-renal. Patient
   has already received NS. There may possibly be underlying chronic
   kidney disease - either secondary to diabetes or poor cardiac
   output/chronic Lasix therapy. Will monitor daily labs to follow Cr,
   BUN, which remain stable this morning.
   - If drop in uop or rise in creat, w/u for ARF including urine lytes
   and bolus as needed.
   .
   # Left Leg Ulcer: Chronic issue. Appears superficial without
   substantial erythema. Wound care with antibiotic ointment, moist
   barrier w/ sterile gauze. Consider wound c/s if worsening.
   .
   # DM2: Hyperglycemic on admission. Hold glipizide. HgbA1c=7.5% on
   [**2153-9-6**]. Start regular insulin sliding scale.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Patient recently prescribed synthroid by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1792**].
   Will continue dose of 25 mcg daily.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes, chronic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease, who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of low back pain. She has been diagnosed with sepsis/pneumonia, chronic systolic CHF, bacturia, chronic renal failure, and a left leg ulcer. She has been receiving treatment for these conditions, including antibiotics, antifungals, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis/Pneumonia: The patient's condition is complicated by the presence of a RUL infiltrate on CXR, fever, and elevated white count. She has been receiving antibiotics, but the infection may not be fully controlled.
2. Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient's chronic heart failure may exacerbate her condition, particularly if she experiences a decline in cardiac function or an increase in fluid accumulation.
3. Bacturia: The patient's urine culture grew >100k enterococcus, which may indicate a persistent infection. She has been receiving antibiotics, but the infection may not be fully controlled.
4. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's chronic kidney disease may worsen if she experiences a decline in renal function or an increase in fluid accumulation.
5. Left Leg Ulcer: The patient's left leg ulcer may become infected or worsen if not properly managed with wound care and antibiotic ointment.
6. DM2: The patient's diabetes may worsen if her blood glucose levels are not properly controlled.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if her thyroid medication is not properly adjusted.
8. Code Status: The patient's code status is full code, which may complicate her care if she experiences a decline in her condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's condition closely for signs of sepsis, pneumonia, or other complications.
2. Adjust her antibiotic regimen as necessary to ensure that the infection is fully controlled.
3. Continue to manage her chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes as necessary.
4. Monitor her left leg ulcer closely for signs of infection or worsening.
5. Adjust her thyroid medication as necessary to ensure that her hypothyroidism is properly managed.
6. Consider referring the patient to a specialist for further management of her chronic conditions.
7. Ensure that the patient's code status is clearly communicated to all healthcare providers involved in her care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   admission and elevated white count. Due to low blood pressure with SBP
   in the 80s at times, patient received an arterial line yesterday and
   levophed, which has subsequently been weaned due to higher BP. Patient
   given 250cc fluid bolus at 10pm for a MAP ~60. Culture data is positive
   for Legionella, which is covered by the levofloxacin which she has been
   receiving. Hyponatremia is also seen with Legionella as well.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a complex medical history, including diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. She was admitted to the ICU with a fever, low blood pressure, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis/Pneumonia: The patient has a positive Legionella urinary antigen and a RUL infiltrate on CXR, which suggests a possible pneumonia. She is receiving coverage for Legionella with levofloxacin, but further testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient has a history of systolic CHF with an ejection fraction of 30%. Her BNP level was elevated in the ED, but multiple CXRs are inconsistent with a CHF exacerbation. She is being monitored for signs of acute exacerbation.
3. Bacturia: The patient's urine culture grew >100k enterococcus, which is covered by vancomycin.
4. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 1.3, and her BUN/Cr ratio is >20, which may indicate pre-renal azotemia. She is being monitored for signs of acute kidney injury.
5. Left Leg Ulcer: The patient has a chronic left leg ulcer that is being managed with wound care and antibiotic ointment.
6. DM2: The patient is hyperglycemic and is being managed with regular insulin sliding scale.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient is being treated with synthroid.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, a heart rate of 76 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 105/62 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.8-14.1 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 10.4-12.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 179-195 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.2-1.3 mg/dL
* Glucose: 119-241 mg/dL

The patient is receiving various medications, including levofloxacin, vancomycin, heparin, and ppi. She is being monitored for signs of infection, and further testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia and to rule out other potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old individual who was admitted to the ICU with SIRS/sepsis. The patient's condition is complex, and multiple medical issues are present.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/72 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 96% on 3L oxygen.

The patient has a central line, arterial line, and multi-lumen line inserted. The patient is receiving antibiotics for Legionella pneumonia, and vancomycin is being continued to provide coverage for possible MRSA. The patient's fluid status is being monitored, and gentle fluid resuscitation is being performed as needed for sepsis and hypotension.

The patient has a history of chronic issues, including left leg ulcer, DM2, and hypothyroidism. The patient's medications include levofloxacin, vancomycin, and heparin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's SIRS/sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiac, and renal failure.
2. Legionella pneumonia: The patient's Legionella pneumonia can worsen, leading to respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. MRSA infection: The patient's possible MRSA infection can lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid resuscitation can lead to fluid overload, which can worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of complications.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's use of heparin can increase the risk of bleeding complications, including hemorrhage and hematoma.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count can increase the risk of bleeding complications and potentially life-threatening bleeding events.
7. Renal failure: The patient's sepsis and fluid overload can lead to acute kidney injury and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's sepsis and fluid overload can lead to cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and potentially life-threatening cardiac events.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust therapy accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."

         PRESUMPTIVE POSITIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
              (Reference Range-Negative).
         Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
         Clinical correlation and additional testing suggested including
   culture and detection of serum antibody.
   Blood culture x2 pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old female with PMH of DM2, CHF, s/p PPM in [**2148**], chronic LE
   edema who presented to the ED after a visiting nurse found her to be
   febrile.
   .
   # Sepsis/Pneumonia: Patient has RUL infiltrate on CXR with fever on
   admission and elevated white count. Due to low blood pressure with SBP
   in the 80s at times, patient received an arterial line yesterday and
   levophed, which has subsequently been weaned due to higher BP. Patient
   given 250cc fluid bolus at 10pm for a MAP ~60. Culture data is positive
   for Legionella, which is covered by the levofloxacin which she has been
   receiving. Hyponatremia is also seen with Legionella as well.
   - Blood cultures x2 pending
   - Continue on Levofloxacin as coverage for legionella
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA coverage
   - IVF Bolus for hypotension/low UOP.
   - Send sputum for culture
   - hold antihypertensives, including b-blocker, ace, Lasix
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has history of systolic CHF with EF=30%
   on [**2152-9-22**]. BNP=[**Numeric Identifier 1756**] in ED with unknown baseline. Multiple CXR are
   inconsistent with a CHF exacerbation. Patient not complaining of
   shortness of breath.
   - Will monitor daily CXR and physical exam to assess acute exacerbation
   - Goal is for even fluid balance given comorbid chronic kidney disease
   and hypotension
   - Patient on home lasix
 will hold for now as BP remains low with low
   UOP
   - Continue to hold beta blocker, ace inhibitor, lasix
   # Bacturia: Patient's UA in the ED showed many bacteria with few WBC
   and negative Leuk esterase. Urine culture grew >100k enterococcus. This
   is covered by vancomycin.
   - Continue vancomycin
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Patient has baseline of approx 1.3 over the
   past year. With BUN/Cr ratio >20, this may also be pre-renal. Patient
   has already received NS. There may possibly be underlying chronic
   kidney disease - either secondary to diabetes or poor cardiac
   output/chronic Lasix therapy. Will monitor daily labs to follow Cr,
   BUN, which remain stable this morning.
   - If drop in uop or rise in creat, w/u for ARF including urine lytes
   and bolus as needed.
   .
   # Left Leg Ulcer: Chronic issue. Appears superficial without
   substantial erythema. Wound care with antibiotic ointment, moist
   barrier w/ sterile gauze. Consider wound c/s if worsening.
   .
   # DM2: Hyperglycemic on admission. Hold glipizide. HgbA1c=7.5% on
   [**2153-9-6**]. Start regular insulin sliding scale.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Patient recently prescribed synthroid by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1792**].
   Will continue dose of 25 mcg daily.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

      Legionella Urinary Antigen  (Final [**2153-10-10**]):
         REPORTED BY PHONE TO [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1811**] AT 14:25PM ON [**2153-10-10**] - 4I.
         PRESUMPTIVE POSITIVE FOR LEGIONELLA SEROGROUP 1 ANTIGEN.
              (Reference Range-Negative).
         Performed by Immunochromogenic assay.
         Clinical correlation and additional testing suggested including
   culture and detection of serum antibody.
   Blood culture x2 pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   84 year old female with PMH of DM2, CHF, s/p PPM in [**2148**], chronic LE
   edema who presented to the ED after a visiting nurse found her to be
   febrile.
   .
   # Sepsis/Pneumonia: Patient has RUL infiltrate on CXR with fever on
   admission and elevated white count. Due to low blood pressure with SBP
   in the 80s at times, patient received an arterial line yesterday and
   levophed, which has subsequently been weaned due to higher BP. Patient
   given 250cc fluid bolus at 10pm for a MAP ~60. Culture data is positive
   for Legionella, which is covered by the levofloxacin which she has been
   receiving. Hyponatremia is also seen with Legionella as well.
   - Blood cultures x2 pending
   - Continue on Levofloxacin as coverage for legionella
   - Continue Vancomycin for MRSA coverage
   - IVF Bolus for hypotension/low UOP.
   - Send sputum for culture
   - hold antihypertensives, including b-blocker, ace, Lasix
   .
   # Chronic Systolic CHF: Patient has history of systolic CHF with EF=30%
   on [**2152-9-22**]. BNP=[**Numeric Identifier 1756**] in ED with unknown baseline. Multiple CXR are
   inconsistent with a CHF exacerbation. Patient not complaining of
   shortness of breath.
   - Will monitor daily CXR and physical exam to assess acute exacerbation
   - Goal is for even fluid balance given comorbid chronic kidney disease
   and hypotension
   - Patient on home lasix
 will hold for now as BP remains low with low
   UOP
   - Continue to hold beta blocker, ace inhibitor, lasix
   # Bacturia: Patient's UA in the ED showed many bacteria with few WBC
   and negative Leuk esterase. Urine culture grew >100k enterococcus. This
   is covered by vancomycin.
   - Continue vancomycin
   .
   # Chronic Renal Failure: Patient has baseline of approx 1.3 over the
   past year. With BUN/Cr ratio >20, this may also be pre-renal. Patient
   has already received NS. There may possibly be underlying chronic
   kidney disease - either secondary to diabetes or poor cardiac
   output/chronic Lasix therapy. Will monitor daily labs to follow Cr,
   BUN, which remain stable this morning.
   - If drop in uop or rise in creat, w/u for ARF including urine lytes
   and bolus as needed.
   .
   # Left Leg Ulcer: Chronic issue. Appears superficial without
   substantial erythema. Wound care with antibiotic ointment, moist
   barrier w/ sterile gauze. Consider wound c/s if worsening.
   .
   # DM2: Hyperglycemic on admission. Hold glipizide. HgbA1c=7.5% on
   [**2153-9-6**]. Start regular insulin sliding scale.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Patient recently prescribed synthroid by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1792**].
   Will continue dose of 25 mcg daily.
   .
   # PPx: SC heparin, PPI

Based on the progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, chronic heart failure, and chronic left-sided edema. She was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of low back pain and presented with fever, tachycardia, and hypotension.

The patient has several medical conditions that are relevant to her current presentation:

1. Sepsis/Pneumonia: The patient has a RUL infiltrate on CXR, fever on admission, and elevated white count. She has a positive urine culture for Enterococcus and Legionella urinary antigen, which is presumptively positive for Legionella serogroup 1 antigen. She is receiving levofloxacin and vancomycin, which are adequate coverages for Legionella and MRSA, respectively.
2. Chronic Systolic CHF: The patient has a history of systolic CHF with an EF of 30%. She has multiple CXRs that are inconsistent with a CHF exacerbation, and she is not complaining of shortness of breath. She is on home Lasix, which will be held for now due to her low blood pressure and low urine output.
3. Bacturia: The patient's urine culture grew >100k Enterococcus, which is covered by vancomycin.
4. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a baseline creatinine of approximately 1.3 over the past year, and her BUN/Cr ratio is >20, which may indicate pre-renal azotemia. She has already received NS, and her creatinine and BUN levels will be monitored daily to follow for signs of acute kidney injury (AKI).
5. Left Leg Ulcer: The patient has a chronic superficial ulcer on her left leg that is being treated with antibiotic ointment and moist barrier dressing. The wound will be monitored for signs of worsening.
6. DM2: The patient is hyperglycemic on admission and will be started on regular insulin sliding scale.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient is prescribed synthroid and will continue to receive a dose of 25 mcg daily.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has a positive urine culture for Enterococcus and Legionella, which increases her risk of developing sepsis.
2. AKI: The patient's chronic renal failure and pre-renal azotemia make her susceptible to developing AKI.
3. CHF exacerbation: The patient's history of systolic CHF and chronic left-sided edema make her at risk for developing CHF exacerbation.
4. Wound infection: The patient's left leg ulcer is at risk for developing infection, which could lead to sepsis and other complications.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia and initiation of insulin therapy make her susceptible to developing hypoglycemia.
6. Thyroid storm: The patient's hypothyroidism and initiation of thyroid replacement therapy make her susceptible to developing thyroid storm.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue levofloxacin and vancomycin for coverage of Legionella and MRSA, respectively.
2. Monitor daily CXR and physical exam to assess for signs of CHF exacerbation.
3. Hold antihypertensives, including beta blocker, ace inhibitor, and Lasix, due to the patient's low blood pressure and low urine output.
4. Monitor daily labs to follow creatinine, BUN, and glucose levels.
5. Continue wound care with antibiotic ointment and moist barrier dressing for the left leg ulcer.
6. Start regular insulin sliding scale for hyperglycemia.
7. Continue thyroid replacement therapy with synthroid."
