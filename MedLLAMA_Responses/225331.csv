   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in [**2112**], s/p 5-FU
   and radiation, chronic biliary obstruction with infected
   bilomas/hepatic abscess on augmentin/levo/fluconazole suppression
   presented [**4-5**] from PCPs office with abdominal distention, LE edema,
   dyspnea found to have duodenal obstructing mass on ERCP [**4-9**]
   complicated by hypoxia and aspiration event.
   .
   #. Cholangitis/Superinfected bilomas: CT performed on admission
   demonstrating increase in size of infected bilomas, rising WBC despite
   PO Augmentin, Levo, Fluc with organisms concerning for infection/abx
   failure/poor abx absorption in setting of gastric outlet obstruciton.
   Patient is s/p IR guided drainage of bilioma, cultures preliminarily
   growing coag positive cocci.  The patient was originally planned to
   have PTC placed to allow drainage of the duct, but this was deferred in
   light of her multiple medical issues. Patient's Abx have been
   vanc/zosyn/fluc since admission. In light of duodenal obstruction found
   on ERCP today, poor absorption of po abx likely contributing to change.
   - continue IV fluc/zosyn/vancomycin
   - ID consulted on admission, will f/u recs
   - f/u blood cultures, biloma cultures
   .
   # Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to aspiration.
   Patient was intubated after ERCP for hypoxia.  After intubation,
   patient's airway was suctioned and revealed aspiration contents that
   are likely reason for patient's hypoxia.  Patient is currently on
   Vanc/Zosyn, which has broad coverage.  Patient is currently intubated
   on AC, saturating in upper 90s on 100% FiO2 with pO2 of 106.  Last ABG
   was 7.40/35/106/22 .  As there is concern for aspiration, will increase
   patient's PEEP to 10.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Zosyn
   - Place A-Line
   - Send for Sputum for culture
   - Continue AC ventilation and and monitor ABGs.  Wean FiO2 as
   tolerated.
   .
   #. Duodenal Stricture: Gastric distention secondary to duodenal
   stricture.    Patient's CT with massive gastric distention.  Patient
   had a stent placed in duodenum.  It is unclear at this point what the
   etiology of the stricture is, whether related to malignancy or benign
   process.  Patient's CT torso is negative for mass or mass effect.
   Prior EGDs have noted duodenal stricture, so this does not appear to be
   a new process, but perhaps a pre-existing lesion that is becoming
   clinically significant.  Patient may benefit from GI vs surgical
   evaluation
   - NGT placed
   - IV fluids, monitor electrolytes carefully
   - continue Reglan
   - Consult GI vs Sugery
   .
   #. Cholangiocarcinoma: Patient with unresectable disease at time of
   diagnosis, s/p 5-FU and radiation. Patient without known recurrence of
   disease to date although constellation of symptoms above concerning for
   potential disease recurrence (vs. all attributable to infectious
   sequelae).  Patient's cancer was dx at [**Hospital1 12**] and has had extensive follow
   up at [**Hospital1 5**].  Will need to touch base w/ [**Hospital 508**] health care
   providers to sort the extent of patient's cancer/treatment.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

1. Cholangitis/Superinfected Bilomas: The patient's infection is likely to progress if not adequately treated, leading to sepsis, organ failure, and potentially fatal outcomes.
2. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen if not managed appropriately, leading to further hypoxia, respiratory acidosis, and potentially fatal outcomes.
3. Duodenal Stricture: The patient's duodenal stricture may lead to further complications such as gastric perforation, peritonitis, and potentially fatal outcomes if not managed promptly.
4. Cancer Recurrence: The patient's cholangiocarcinoma may recur, leading to further complications and potentially fatal outcomes if not managed promptly.
5. Sepsis: The patient's infection may lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
6. Organ Failure: The patient's infection and respiratory failure may lead to organ failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's duodenal stricture may lead to further gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
8. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's fluid and electrolyte imbalance may lead to further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and potentially fatal outcomes if not managed promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV antibiotics and antifungals to manage the patient's infection.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust ventilation settings as needed to prevent further hypoxia.
3. Manage the patient's duodenal stricture with NGT and IV fluids, and consider GI or surgical evaluation.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely and adjust fluid and electrolyte management as needed to prevent further complications.
5. Consider consulting with GI or surgical specialists to further evaluate and manage the patient's duodenal stricture.
6. Monitor the patient's cancer status closely and consider further evaluation and treatment if necessary.
7. Consider consulting with infectious disease specialists to further evaluate and manage the patient's infection.
8. Monitor the patient's overall condition closely and adjust management as needed to prevent further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in [**2112**], s/p 5-FU
   and radiation, chronic biliary obstruction with infected
   bilomas/hepatic abscess on augmentin/levo/fluconazole suppression
   presented [**4-5**] from PCPs office with abdominal distention, LE edema,
   dyspnea found to have duodenal obstructing mass on ERCP [**4-9**]
   complicated by hypoxia and aspiration event.
   .
   # Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient s/p reintubation.
   Patient was intubated after ERCP for hypoxia.  After intubation,
   patient's airway was suctioned and revealed aspiration contents that
   are likely reason for patient's hypoxia.  Patient is currently on
   Vanc/Zosyn, which has broad coverage.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Zosyn
   - Send for Sputum for culture
   - Continue AC ventilation and and monitor ABGs.  Wean FiO2 as
   tolerated.
   - Consider bronchoscopy
   #. Cholangitis/Superinfected bilomas: CT performed on admission
   demonstrating increase in size of infected bilomas, rising WBC despite
   PO Augmentin, Levo, Fluc with organisms concerning for infection/abx
   failure/poor abx absorption in setting of gastric outlet obstruciton.
   Patient is s/p IR guided drainage of bilioma, cultures preliminarily
   growing coag positive cocci.  The patient was originally planned to
   have PTC placed to allow drainage of the duct, but this was deferred in
   light of her multiple medical issues. Patient's Abx have been
   vanc/zosyn/fluc since admission. In light of duodenal obstruction found
   on ERCP today, poor absorption of po abx likely contributing to change.
   - continue IV fluc/zosyn/vancomycin
   - ID consulted on admission, will f/u recs
   - f/u blood cultures, biloma cultures
   .
   .
   #. Duodenal Stricture: Gastric distention secondary to duodenal
   stricture.    Patient's CT with massive gastric distention.  Patient
   had a stent placed in duodenum.  It is unclear at this point what the
   etiology of the stricture is, whether related to malignancy or benign
   process.  Patient's CT torso is negative for mass or mass effect.
   Prior EGDs have noted duodenal stricture, so this does not appear to be
   a new process, but perhaps a pre-existing lesion that is becoming
   clinically significant.  Patient may benefit from GI vs surgical
   evaluation
   - NGT placed
   - IV fluids, monitor electrolytes carefully
   - continue Reglan
   - Consult GI oncology
   .
   #. Cholangiocarcinoma: Patient with unresectable disease at time of
   diagnosis, s/p 5-FU and radiation. Patient without known recurrence of
   disease to date although constellation of symptoms above concerning for
   potential disease recurrence (vs. all attributable to infectious
   sequelae).  Patient's cancer was dx at [**Hospital1 12**] and has had extensive follow
   up at [**Hospital1 5**].  Will need to touch base w/ [**Hospital 508**] health care
   providers to sort the extent of patient's cancer/treatment.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of cholangiocarcinoma, who presented with abdominal distention, left lower extremity edema, and dyspnea. She was found to have a duodenal obstructing mass and was intubated for hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, cholangitis/superinfected bilomas, and a duodenal stricture. She is currently receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin and Zosyn, and is being ventilated with a CPAP/PSV mode. The patient has a history of gastric outlet obstruction, which is likely contributing to poor absorption of oral antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a risk of further deterioration due to her underlying conditions, including the duodenal stricture and gastric outlet obstruction.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her cholangitis/superinfected bilomas and the presence of multiple lines and drains.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's duodenal stricture and gastric outlet obstruction may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which could exacerbate her respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may be indicative of cardiac stress, and there is a risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
5. Renal Failure: The patient's high urine output and fluid balance issues may indicate a risk of renal failure, particularly in the setting of sepsis and hypovolemia.
6. Metabolic Complications: The patient's hyperglycemia and electrolyte imbalances may indicate a risk of metabolic complications, including diabetic ketoacidosis and electrolyte disturbances.
7. Infection: The patient's cholangitis/superinfected bilomas and the presence of multiple lines and drains increase her risk of developing further infections.
8. Gastrointestinal Obstruction: The patient's duodenal stricture and gastric outlet obstruction may lead to further gastrointestinal obstruction, which could exacerbate her respiratory failure.
9. Nutritional Complications: The patient's inability to tolerate oral intake and her need for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may lead to nutritional complications, including malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances.
10. Psychological Complications: The patient's critical illness and need for prolonged mechanical ventilation may lead to psychological complications, including anxiety, depression, and delirium."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in [**2112**], s/p 5-FU
   and radiation, chronic biliary obstruction with infected
   bilomas/hepatic abscess on augmentin/levo/fluconazole suppression
   presented [**4-5**] from PCPs office with abdominal distention, LE edema,
   dyspnea found to have duodenal obstructing mass on ERCP [**4-9**]
   complicated by hypoxia and aspiration event.
   .
   #. Cholangitis/Superinfected bilomas: CT performed on admission
   demonstrating increase in size of infected bilomas, rising WBC despite
   PO Augmentin, Levo, Fluc with organisms concerning for infection/abx
   failure/poor abx absorption in setting of gastric outlet obstruciton.
   Patient is s/p IR guided drainage of bilioma, cultures preliminarily
   growing coag positive cocci.  The patient was originally planned to
   have PTC placed to allow drainage of the duct, but this was deferred in
   light of her multiple medical issues. Patient's Abx have been
   vanc/zosyn/fluc since admission. In light of duodenal obstruction found
   on ERCP today, poor absorption of po abx likely contributing to change.
   - continue IV fluc/zosyn/vancomycin
   - ID consulted on admission, will f/u recs
   - f/u blood cultures, biloma cultures
   .
   # Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to aspiration.
   Patient was intubated after ERCP for hypoxia.  After intubation,
   patient's airway was suctioned and revealed aspiration contents that
   are likely reason for patient's hypoxia.  Patient is currently on
   Vanc/Zosyn, which has broad coverage.  Patient is currently intubated
   on AC, saturating in upper 90s on 100% FiO2 with pO2 of 106.  Last ABG
   was 7.40/35/106/22 . Self-extubated this AM and reintubated. Appears to
   have LUL collapse. Will consider bronch today to focally suction.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Zosyn
   - Place A-Line
   - Send for Sputum for culture
   - PS ventilation this AM may be able to extubate soon after bronch
   later this AM.  Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   .
   #. Duodenal Stricture: Gastric distention secondary to duodenal
   stricture.    Patient's CT with massive gastric distention.  Patient
   had a stent placed in duodenum.  It is unclear at this point what the
   etiology of the stricture is, whether related to malignancy or benign
   process.  Patient's CT torso is negative for mass or mass effect.
   Prior EGDs have noted duodenal stricture, so this does not appear to be
   a new process, but perhaps a pre-existing lesion that is becoming
   clinically significant.  Patient may benefit from GI vs surgical
   evaluation
   - NGT placed
   - IV fluids, monitor electrolytes carefully
   - continue Reglan
   - Consult GI vs Sugery
   .
   #. Cholangiocarcinoma: Patient with unresectable disease at time of
   diagnosis, s/p 5-FU and radiation. Patient without known recurrence of
   disease to date although constellation of symptoms above concerning for
   potential disease recurrence (vs. all attributable to infectious
   sequelae).  Patient's cancer was dx at [**Hospital1 12**] and has had extensive follow
   up at [**Hospital1 5**].  Will need to touch base w/ [**Hospital 508**] health care
   providers to sort the extent of patient's cancer/treatment.  Will ask
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2998**] to see her.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   - ID consulted on admission, will f/u recs
   - f/u blood cultures, biloma cultures
   .
   # Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Likely secondary to aspiration.
   Patient was intubated after ERCP for hypoxia.  After intubation,
   patient's airway was suctioned and revealed aspiration contents that
   are likely reason for patient's hypoxia.  Patient is currently on
   Vanc/Zosyn, which has broad coverage.  Patient is currently intubated
   on AC, saturating in upper 90s on 100% FiO2 with pO2 of 106.  Last ABG
   was 7.40/35/106/22 . Self-extubated this AM and reintubated. Appears to
   have LUL collapse. Will consider bronch today to focally suction.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Zosyn
   - Place A-Line
   - Send for Sputum for culture
   - PS ventilation this AM may be able to extubate soon after bronch
   later this AM.  Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
   .
   #. Duodenal Stricture: Gastric distention secondary to duodenal
   stricture.    Patient's CT with massive gastric distention.  Patient
   had a stent placed in duodenum.  It is unclear at this point what the
   etiology of the stricture is, whether related to malignancy or benign
   process.  Patient's CT torso is negative for mass or mass effect.
   Prior EGDs have noted duodenal stricture, so this does not appear to be
   a new process, but perhaps a pre-existing lesion that is becoming
   clinically significant.  Patient may benefit from GI vs surgical
   evaluation
   - NGT placed
   - IV fluids, monitor electrolytes carefully
   - continue Reglan
   - Consult GI vs Sugery
   .
   #. Cholangiocarcinoma: Patient with unresectable disease at time of
   diagnosis, s/p 5-FU and radiation. Patient without known recurrence of
   disease to date although constellation of symptoms above concerning for
   potential disease recurrence (vs. all attributable to infectious
   sequelae).  Patient's cancer was dx at [**Hospital1 12**] and has had extensive follow
   up at [**Hospital1 5**].  Will need to touch base w/ [**Hospital 508**] health care
   providers to sort the extent of patient's cancer/treatment.  Will ask

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of cholangiocarcinoma, chronic biliary obstruction, and infected bilomas/hepatic abscess. She presented with abdominal distention, LE edema, dyspnea, and was found to have a duodenal obstructing mass on ERCP.

The patient has developed several medical complications, including:

1. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure: likely secondary to aspiration, which led to intubation and suctioning of the airway. She is currently on Vanc/Zosyn, which has broad coverage.
2. Duodenal stricture: causing gastric distention, which was treated with a stent placement. The etiology of the stricture is unclear, but it may be related to malignancy or a benign process.
3. Cholangitis/Superinfected bilomas: with organisms concerning for infection/abx failure/poor abx absorption in setting of gastric outlet obstruction.
4. FEN (Fever, Electrolyte, and Nutrition) imbalance: with NPO, IV fluids, and TPN.
5. Sedation: with Propofol while intubated.
6. Ppx (Prophylaxis): SQ Heparin, IV PPI, and other medications.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 8.9 K/uL
* Hct: 37.4%
* Plt: 294 K/uL
* Cr: 0.3 mg/dL
* TCO2: 22 mmol/L
* Glucose: 189 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.8/28.7/1.2, ALT/AST: 27/42, Alk Phos/T Bili: 224/1.0, Lactic Acid: 2.0 mmol/L, Albumin: 1.9 g/dL, LDH: 256 IU/L, Ca++: 8.7 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.5 mg/dL, PO4: 2.7 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CXR: demonstrating left upper lobe volume loss
* CT: showing massive gastric distention, infected bilomas, and duodenal stricture

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Continue IV fluc/zosyn/vancomycin for cholangitis/superinfected bilomas.
2. ID consultation for further recommendations.
3. F/u blood cultures and biloma cultures.
4. Continue Vancomycin/Zosyn for acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
5. Place A-Line for arterial line placement.
6. Send for sputum culture.
7. PS ventilation to consider extubation soon after bronch later this AM.
8. Wean FiO2 as tolerated.
9. NGT placement for duodenal stricture.
10. IV fluids and monitor electrolytes carefully.
11. Continue Reglan.
12. Consult GI vs surgery for duodenal stricture.
13. Touch base with [**Hospital 508**] healthcare providers for further evaluation of the patient's cancer/treatment.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure due to continued hypoxia and aspiration.
2. Infection and sepsis due to ongoing cholangitis and superinfected bilomas.
3. Gastric perforation or bleeding due to duodenal stricture.
4. Electrolyte imbalance and acid-base disorders due to continued IV fluids and TPN.
5. Bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy.
6. Worsening of the patient's underlying cholangiocarcinoma.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to ensure timely interventions and management of these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in [**2112**], s/p 5-FU
   and radiation, chronic biliary obstruction with infected
   bilomas/hepatic abscess on augmentin/levo/fluconazole suppression
   presented [**4-5**] from PCPs office with abdominal distention, LE edema,
   dyspnea found to have duodenal obstructing mass on ERCP [**4-9**]
   complicated by hypoxia and aspiration event.
   .
   # Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient s/p reintubation.
   Patient was intubated after ERCP for hypoxia.  After intubation,
   patient's airway was suctioned and revealed aspiration contents that
   are likely reason for patient's hypoxia.  She self extubated on [**4-10**]
   and then was reintubated.  She is s/p bronchoscopy and a small piece of
   food (likely meat) was suctioned from her LUL which corresponded to her
   LUL collapse on CXR.  Patient is currently on Vanc/Zosyn, which has
   broad coverage.  Her sputum was sent for cx and is growing yeast with
   pseudohyphae and gram + cocci in pairs.  She is being continued on PS
   for now.
   -family is discussing possible extubation and CMO
   .
   # hypotension: On the morning of [**4-11**] she dropped her BPs requiring
   requiring starting levo and boluses of several liters of fluids. She
   remained afebrile ut had an increasing white count.
   -continued on vancomycin/zosyn/fluconazole until decision for CMO
   confirmed
   -f/u ID recs, blood cx, biloma cx, bronch cx,, sputum cx
   - continue levo to maintain SBP until CMO status confirmed.
   .
   #. Cholangitis/Superinfected bilomas: CT performed on admission
   demonstrating increase in size of infected bilomas, rising WBC despite
   PO Augmentin, Levofloxacin, Fluconazole at home.  There was concern for
   infection/abx failure/poor abx absorption in setting of gastric outlet
   obstruciton.   Her antibiotics were changed to
   vancomycin/zosyn/fluconazole on admission.  In light of the duodenal
   obstruction found on ERCP her failure of her home antibiotics were
   likely due to poor absorption
   -continued on vancomycin/zosyn/fluconazole until decision for CMO
   confirmed
   -f/u ID recs, blood cx, biloma cx, bronch cx,, sputum cx
   - continue levo to maintain SBP until CMO status confirmed.
   .
   #. Duodenal Stricture: Pt had gastric distention secondary to duodenal
   stricture.    Patient's CT had massive gastric distention.  Patient had
   a stent placed in duodenum.  It was unclear what the etiology of the
   stricture is, whether related to malignancy or benign process.
   Patient's CT torso is negative for mass or mass effect.  Prior EGDs
   have noted duodenal stricture, so this was not a new process, but
   perhaps a pre-existing lesion that became clinically significant.  NGT
   placed to suction and a lot of bilius fluid came back.  She was started
   on reglan and was started on TPN.
   .
   #. Cholangiocarcinoma: Patient with unresectable disease at time of
   diagnosis, s/p 5-FU and radiation. Patient without known recurrence of
   disease to date although constellation of symptoms above concerning for
   potential disease recurrence (vs. all attributable to infectious
   sequelae).

   Disposition: ICU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of cholangiocarcinoma, chronic biliary obstruction, and infected bilomas/hepatic abscess. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute hypoxic respiratory failure, hypotension, and cholangitis/superinfected bilomas.

The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential complications:

1. Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's airway was suctioned and revealed aspiration contents, which likely caused her hypoxia. She was reintubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure dropped, requiring the administration of vasopressors and fluid boluses.
3. Cholangitis/Superinfected Bilomas: The patient's antibiotics were changed to vancomycin, zosyn, and fluconazole due to the presence of infected bilomas.
4. Duodenal Stricture: The patient had a duodenal stricture, which caused gastric distention and was treated with a stent placement.
5. Cholangiocarcinoma: The patient has unresectable disease and is at risk for disease recurrence.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute hypoxic respiratory failure can progress to chronic respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis: The patient's infected bilomas and cholangitis can lead to sepsis, which can cause multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Bleeding: The patient's vasopressor therapy can cause bleeding complications, especially if the patient has coagulopathy.
4. Renal failure: The patient's hypotension and sepsis can cause acute kidney injury, which can progress to chronic kidney disease.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's duodenal stricture and cholangiocarcinoma can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, obstruction, and perforation.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and sepsis can cause cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's sepsis and hypotension can cause neurological dysfunction, including altered mental status, seizures, and stroke.

Given the patient's complex condition, it is essential to monitor her closely for any signs of deterioration and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in [**2112**], s/p 5-FU
   and radiation, chronic biliary obstruction with infected
   bilomas/hepatic abscess on augmentin/levo/fluconazole suppression
   presented [**4-5**] from PCPs office with abdominal distention, LE edema,
   dyspnea found to have duodenal obstructing mass on ERCP [**4-9**]
   complicated by hypoxia and aspiration event.
   .
   # Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient s/p reintubation.
   Patient was intubated after ERCP for hypoxia.  After intubation,
   patient's airway was suctioned and revealed aspiration contents that
   are likely reason for patient's hypoxia.  Patient is currently on
   Vanc/Zosyn, which has broad coverage.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Zosyn
   - Send for Sputum for culture
   - Continue AC ventilation and and monitor ABGs.  Wean FiO2 as
   tolerated.
   - Consider bronchoscopy
   #. Cholangitis/Superinfected bilomas: CT performed on admission
   demonstrating increase in size of infected bilomas, rising WBC despite
   PO Augmentin, Levo, Fluc with organisms concerning for infection/abx
   failure/poor abx absorption in setting of gastric outlet obstruciton.
   Patient is s/p IR guided drainage of bilioma, cultures preliminarily
   growing coag positive cocci.  The patient was originally planned to
   have PTC placed to allow drainage of the duct, but this was deferred in
   light of her multiple medical issues. Patient's Abx have been
   vanc/zosyn/fluc since admission. In light of duodenal obstruction found
   on ERCP today, poor absorption of po abx likely contributing to change.
   - continue IV fluc/zosyn/vancomycin
   - ID consulted on admission, will f/u recs
   - f/u blood cultures, biloma cultures
   .
   .
   #. Duodenal Stricture: Gastric distention secondary to duodenal
   stricture.    Patient's CT with massive gastric distention.  Patient
   had a stent placed in duodenum.  It is unclear at this point what the
   etiology of the stricture is, whether related to malignancy or benign
   process.  Patient's CT torso is negative for mass or mass effect.
   Prior EGDs have noted duodenal stricture, so this does not appear to be
   a new process, but perhaps a pre-existing lesion that is becoming
   clinically significant.  Patient may benefit from GI vs surgical
   evaluation
   - NGT placed
   - IV fluids, monitor electrolytes carefully
   - continue Reglan
   - Consult GI oncology
   .
   #. Cholangiocarcinoma: Patient with unresectable disease at time of
   diagnosis, s/p 5-FU and radiation. Patient without known recurrence of
   disease to date although constellation of symptoms above concerning for
   potential disease recurrence (vs. all attributable to infectious
   sequelae).  Patient's cancer was dx at [**Hospital1 12**] and has had extensive follow

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year old female with cholangiocarcinoma diagnosed in [**2112**], s/p 5-FU
   and radiation, chronic biliary obstruction with infected
   bilomas/hepatic abscess on augmentin/levo/fluconazole suppression
   presented [**4-5**] from PCPs office with abdominal distention, LE edema,
   dyspnea found to have duodenal obstructing mass on ERCP [**4-9**]
   complicated by hypoxia and aspiration event.
   .
   # Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient s/p reintubation.
   Patient was intubated after ERCP for hypoxia.  After intubation,
   patient's airway was suctioned and revealed aspiration contents that
   are likely reason for patient's hypoxia.  Patient is currently on
   Vanc/Zosyn, which has broad coverage.
   - Continue Vancomycin/Zosyn
   - Send for Sputum for culture
   - Continue AC ventilation and and monitor ABGs.  Wean FiO2 as
   tolerated.
   - Consider bronchoscopy
   #. Cholangitis/Superinfected bilomas: CT performed on admission
   demonstrating increase in size of infected bilomas, rising WBC despite
   PO Augmentin, Levo, Fluc with organisms concerning for infection/abx
   failure/poor abx absorption in setting of gastric outlet obstruciton.
   Patient is s/p IR guided drainage of bilioma, cultures preliminarily
   growing coag positive cocci.  The patient was originally planned to
   have PTC placed to allow drainage of the duct, but this was deferred in
   light of her multiple medical issues. Patient's Abx have been
   vanc/zosyn/fluc since admission. In light of duodenal obstruction found
   on ERCP today, poor absorption of po abx likely contributing to change.
   - continue IV fluc/zosyn/vancomycin
   - ID consulted on admission, will f/u recs
   - f/u blood cultures, biloma cultures
   .
   .
   #. Duodenal Stricture: Gastric distention secondary to duodenal
   stricture.    Patient's CT with massive gastric distention.  Patient
   had a stent placed in duodenum.  It is unclear at this point what the
   etiology of the stricture is, whether related to malignancy or benign
   process.  Patient's CT torso is negative for mass or mass effect.
   Prior EGDs have noted duodenal stricture, so this does not appear to be
   a new process, but perhaps a pre-existing lesion that is becoming
   clinically significant.  Patient may benefit from GI vs surgical
   evaluation
   - NGT placed
   - IV fluids, monitor electrolytes carefully
   - continue Reglan
   - Consult GI oncology
   .
   #. Cholangiocarcinoma: Patient with unresectable disease at time of
   diagnosis, s/p 5-FU and radiation. Patient without known recurrence of
   disease to date although constellation of symptoms above concerning for
   potential disease recurrence (vs. all attributable to infectious
   sequelae).  Patient's cancer was dx at [**Hospital1 12**] and has had extensive follow
   up at [**Hospital1 5**].  Will need to touch base w/ [**Hospital 508**] health care
   providers to sort the extent of patient's cancer/treatment.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the events and potential medical complications:

**Events:**

* The patient was intubated after ERCP due to hypoxia and aspiration event.
* The patient self-extubated at 08:00 AM on [**2123-4-10**] and was reintubated.
* Bronchoscopy was performed at 01:00 PM on [**2123-4-10**].
* EKGs were performed at 11:10 PM on [**2123-4-10**] and 06:15 AM on [**2123-4-11**].

**Medical Complications:**

* Acute Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia and aspiration event led to acute respiratory failure, which was managed with reintubation and mechanical ventilation.
* Cholangitis/Superinfected bilomas: The patient's infected bilomas and rising WBC count despite antibiotics suggest a high risk of cholangitis and superinfected bilomas.
* Duodenal Stricture: The patient's gastric distention and duodenal stricture may lead to further complications such as obstruction, perforation, or bleeding.
* Cholangiocarcinoma: The patient's unresectable cancer may recur, leading to further complications and poor outcomes.
* FEN (Fever, Elevated White Blood Cell Count, and Nausea and Vomiting): The patient's fever, elevated WBC count, and nausea and vomiting may indicate a sepsis or infection.
* Sedation: The patient's sedation with propofol while intubated may lead to respiratory depression or other complications.
* Nutrition: The patient's NPO status and need for TPN may lead to malnutrition and other complications.
* Lines: The patient's PICC line and arterial line may be associated with bleeding, infection, or other complications.

**Assessment and Plan:**

* The patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring is necessary to manage the potential medical complications.
* The patient's antibiotics should be continued, and further cultures should be sent to monitor for bacterial growth.
* The patient's mechanical ventilation should be weaned as tolerated, and ABGs should be closely monitored.
* A bronchoscopy may be considered to evaluate the patient's airway and potential sources of infection.
* The patient's duodenal stricture should be further evaluated with GI oncology consultation.
* The patient's cholangiocarcinoma should be reassessed with follow-up imaging and consultation with the patient's healthcare providers."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of cholangiocarcinoma, diagnosed in [**2112**], who presented with abdominal distention, LE edema, and dyspnea. She was found to have a duodenal obstructing mass on ERCP and developed hypoxia and aspiration. The patient was intubated and received IV antibiotics, but her WBC count is increasing, and cultures are growing coag-positive cocci. She has a duodenal stricture, and a stent was placed in the duodenum. The patient's condition is complicated by cholangitis, superinfected bilomas, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and gastric distention.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's increasing WBC count and growing coag-positive cocci in cultures suggest a high risk of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Multi-Organ Failure: The patient's critically ill condition, combined with her underlying cancer and multiple medical issues, increases the risk of multi-organ failure.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen, leading to prolonged mechanical ventilation, respiratory failure, and potentially, death.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's duodenal stricture and gastric distention increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bowel obstruction, perforation, and bleeding.
5. Cancer Recurrence: The patient's constellation of symptoms, including abdominal distention, LE edema, and dyspnea, may be related to cancer recurrence, which could worsen her condition and prognosis.
6. Infection-Related Complications: The patient's superinfected bilomas and cholangitis increase the risk of infection-related complications, such as abscesses, bacteremia, and septic shock.
7. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and potential need for TPN increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies, which can worsen her condition and prolong her hospital stay.

Based on the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor her vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status, and to adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent and manage potential complications."
