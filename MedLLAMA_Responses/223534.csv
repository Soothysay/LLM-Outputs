   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - consider cath
   - on lidocaine ggt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  Possible new area of infarct that precipitated the VT
   arrest.  Prior to his arrest he had not been complaining of active
   chest pain. He had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate,
   and lisinopril but his ASA was held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocain, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine) initially but now stable without
   pressors.
   - Goal MAP>60 with phenylephrine
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s
   - continous EEG study
   - currently on fentanyl and versed for sedation
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - f/u with neurosurgery
   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.
   - Transfuse for Hct<30
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole ggt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazoe and clarithromycin (Now Day 5, started [**2174-11-17**])
   - Monitor for bleeding
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily
   - Ask social work to check-in
   .
   FEN: Diabetic diet with soft consistency and thin liquids ([**2-14**]
   dentures, passed video swallow) as well as boost glucose supplements,
   NPO after midnight for colonoscopy tomorrow, lytes PRN, IVF/blood
   products PRN, nutrition following
   - AM K = 3.6 -> 40 meq K over 4h through PICC
   .
   ACCESS: PIV's

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, which was likely caused by an anterior septal infarction.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest was likely caused by an anterior septal infarction, and he is at risk for further cardiac events. He is currently on lidocaine for VT control and will need to be monitored for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities, and bleeding.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to cardiogenic shock or medication adverse events. He is currently on pressors and will need to be monitored for MAP > 60.
3. Neurological signs: The patient is unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli and is undergoing arctic sun protocol. He will need to be monitored for neurological improvement and will require continuous EEG study.
4. Bacteremia/epidural abscess: The patient has a positive BCx for MSSA and a MRI-positive for 1 cm abscess. He will need to be followed by neurosurgery and will require antibiotics and antifungal therapy.
5. GI bleed: The patient had a GI bleed on [**2174-11-15**] and has been stabilized since then. He will need to be monitored for bleeding and will require transfusions for Hct < 30.
6. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient has multiple surgeries and has an ulcer on his medial plantar right foot. He will need to be monitored for wound care and will require antibiotics for infection.
7. Type 2 diabetes: The patient has type 2 diabetes and will need to be monitored for glycemic control. He is currently on a diabetic diet and will require insulin therapy if his blood glucose levels are not controlled.
8. Mesothelioma: The patient has pleural thickening and bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis. He will need to be followed by thoracic surgery as an outpatient.
9. Depression: The patient has multiple medical issues and procedures and may be at risk for depression. He will need to be monitored for depression and will require antidepressant therapy.

The patient's medications include:

* Lidocaine for VT control

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities
   - D/C lidocaine ggt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  Possible new area of infarct that precipitated the VT
   arrest.  Prior to his arrest he had not been complaining of active
   chest pain. He had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate,
   and lisinopril but his ASA was held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
 no increase x 3
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocain, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine) initially but now stable without
   pressors.
   - Goal MAP>60 with phenylephrine
   .
   .
   .
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s
   - continous EEG study
   - currently on fentanyl and versed for sedation
   - Head CT when warm
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - f/u with neurosurgery
   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.
   - Transfuse for Hct<30
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole ggt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazoe and clarithromycin (change to amox) (Now Day 5, started
   [**2174-11-17**])
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaic GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest. The patient has a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and a recent gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient's current condition is critical, with ongoing hypotension, requiring pressor support, and a cardiac rhythm of sinus bradycardia. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, requiring invasive ventilation, and has a severe epidural abscess, which is being treated with antibiotics.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating possible myocardial infarction, and abnormal liver function tests, which may be related to the patient's history of liver disease.

The patient's medications include anticoagulation therapy, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors, which may be contributing to his hypotension. The patient is also receiving sedation and analgesia, including fentanyl and midazolam, which may be affecting his neurological status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent cardiac arrest puts him at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's epidural abscess and bacteremia may lead to sepsis, which can cause organ failure and death.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, requiring more aggressive respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation.
4. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status may deteriorate further, requiring more aggressive management, including the use of sedatives and analgesics.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding may recur, requiring more aggressive management, including the use of anticoagulation therapy and gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state may lead to further infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, or bloodstream infections.
7. Organ failure: The patient's underlying medical conditions, including liver disease and kidney disease, may worsen, leading to organ failure.

To mitigate these potential complications, the patient's care team should:

1. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Continue antibiotic therapy for the patient's epidural abscess and bacteremia.
3. Aggressively manage the patient's respiratory failure, including the use of mechanical ventilation and respiratory therapy.
4. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust therapy as necessary to prevent further neurological deterioration.
5. Manage the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding prophylaxis and anticoagulation therapy to prevent further bleeding.
6. Monitor the patient's infection risk and take steps to prevent further infections, including the use of antimicrobial prophylaxis and infection control measures.
7. Monitor the patient's organ function and take steps to prevent organ failure, including the use of diuretics and other medications as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities
   - D/C lidocaine ggt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  Possible new area of infarct that precipitated the VT
   arrest.  Prior to his arrest he had not been complaining of active
   chest pain. He had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate,
   and lisinopril but his ASA was held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
 no increase x 3
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocain, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine) initially but now stable without
   pressors.
   - Goal MAP>60 with phenylephrine
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s
   - continous EEG study
   - currently on fentanyl and versed for sedation
   - Head CT when warm
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - f/u with neurosurgery
   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.
   - Transfuse for Hct<30
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole ggt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazoe and clarithromycin (change to amox) (Now Day 5, started
   [**2174-11-17**])
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaic GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily
   - Ask social work to check-in

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Cardiogenic shock due to the cardiac arrest and potential ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome).
	* Hypotension, which may require pressor support.
	* Arrhythmias, such as VT (ventricular tachycardia), which may require medication and monitoring.
2. Neurological complications:
	* Severe neurological signs, including unresponsiveness to pain or verbal stimuli, which may indicate a high risk of neurological injury or damage.
	* The presence of an epidural abscess, which may require surgical intervention and antibiotic treatment.
3. Infection and sepsis:
	* Bacteremia, which may have originated from the skin ulcers or other sources.
	* Presumptive h pylori infection, which may require antibiotic treatment.
	* Risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of an epidural abscess and bacteremia.
4. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* Risk of bleeding due to the recent GI bleed and ongoing anticoagulation therapy.
	* Presence of peptic ulcers, which may require further treatment and monitoring.
5. Respiratory complications:
	* Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of invasive ventilation.
	* Risk of respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying lung disease and potential ACS.
6. Peripheral vascular disease:
	* Risk of further complications due to the patient's severe peripheral vascular disease, including potential amputation.
7. Diabetes:
	* Risk of hyperglycemia due to the patient's diabetes and potential insulin resistance.
	* Need for close monitoring and management of blood glucose levels.
8. Mesothelioma:
	* Presence of pleural thickening and calcified pleural plaques, which may indicate a high risk of developing mesothelioma.
	* Need for further evaluation and follow-up with thoracic surgery.
9. Depression:
	* Risk of developing depression due to the patient's multiple medical issues and procedures.
	* Need for close monitoring and management of depression symptoms.

The patient's overall condition is critical, and close monitoring and management of these potential complications are essential to prevent further deterioration and improve the patient's outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities
   - D/C lidocaine ggt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  Possible new area of infarct that precipitated the VT
   arrest.  Prior to his arrest he had not been complaining of active
   chest pain. He had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate,
   and lisinopril but his ASA was held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
 no increase x 3

   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocain, amiodarone). Required pressor

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities
   - D/C lidocaine ggt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  Possible new area of infarct that precipitated the VT
   arrest.  Prior to his arrest he had not been complaining of active
   chest pain. He had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate,
   and lisinopril but his ASA was held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
 no increase x 3
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocain, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine) initially but now stable without
   pressors.
   - Goal MAP>60 with phenylephrine
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s
   - continous EEG study
   - currently on fentanyl and versed for sedation
   - Head CT when warm
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - f/u with neurosurgery
   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.
   - Transfuse for Hct<30
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole ggt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazoe and clarithromycin (change to amox) (Now Day 5, started
   [**2174-11-17**])
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaic GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, likely caused by an anteroseptal infarction.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* He is intubated and nonresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli.
* He has a severe hypoxic episode, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 425.
* He has a cardiac arrest, with a history of VT and a recent episode of VT arrest.
* He has a presumed acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with new hypokinetic areas in the anterior septal wall.
* He has a bacteremia/epidural abscess, with a positive blood culture for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).
* He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, with a recent episode of gastrointestinal bleeding on [**2174-11-15**].
* He has a type 2 diabetes, with a history of diet-controlled diabetes and a last HbA1c level of 5.7%.
* He has a history of peripheral vascular disease, with multiple surgeries and a current ulcer on the medial plantar right foot.
* He has a history of mesothelioma, with a concerning pleural thickening on a recent chest CT scan.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and presumed ACS increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac rupture.
* Neurological complications: The patient's bacteremia/epidural abscess and history of gastrointestinal bleeding increase his risk of neurological complications, such as meningitis, sepsis, and brain abscess.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and current bacteremia/epidural abscess increase his risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal perforation, hemorrhage, and abscess.
* Respiratory complications: The patient's severe hypoxic episode and history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increase his risk of respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
* Infectious complications: The patient's bacteremia/epidural abscess and history of gastrointestinal bleeding increase his risk of infectious complications, such as sepsis, meningitis, and abscess.

To address these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU. This includes:

* Cardiac monitoring: The patient's cardiac rhythm and function should be closely monitored to detect any signs of cardiac complications.
* Neurological monitoring: The patient's neurological status should be closely monitored to detect any signs of neurological complications.
* Gastrointestinal monitoring: The patient's gastrointestinal status should be closely monitored to detect any signs of gastrointestinal complications.
* Respiratory monitoring: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored to detect any signs of respiratory complications.
* Infectious monitoring: The patient's infectious status should be closely monitored to detect any signs of infectious complications.

In addition to these measures, the patient's treatment plan should include:

* Cardiac medications: The patient should be started on cardiac medications, such as beta-blockers and antiplatelet agents, to reduce his risk of cardiac complications.
* Antibiotics: The patient should be started on antibiotics to treat his bacteremia/epidural abscess.
* Gastrointestinal medications: The patient should be started on gastrointestinal medications, such as proton pump inhibitors and histamine-2 blockers, to reduce his risk of gastrointestinal complications.
* Respiratory medications: The patient should be started on respiratory medications, such as bronchodilators and corticosteroids, to reduce his risk of respiratory complications.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management in the ICU to reduce his risk of complications and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was transferred to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, which was likely caused by an anteroseptal infarction. He has multiple comorbidities, including a history of GI bleed, bacteremia, and epidural abscess.

Current Status:

* The patient is currently in the ICU with a cardiac arrest code status.
* He is receiving dopamine and fentanyl infusions for hemodynamic support and sedation.
* His temperature has been normalized, and he is being monitored for neurological improvement.
* He has a central line, arterial line, and PICC line in place.
* His urine output is adequate, and his creatinine level is stable at 1.2.
* He is being treated with cefazolin for bacteremia and epidural abscess.

Potential Medical Complications:

* Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and VT arrest may have caused irreversible damage to his heart. He may be at risk for further cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or arrhythmias.
* Neurological complications: The patient's epidural abscess and bacteremia may have caused neurological damage. He may be at risk for further neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or spinal cord compression.
* GI complications: The patient's history of GI bleed and recent colonoscopy may increase his risk for further GI bleeding or perforation.
* Infection: The patient's bacteremia and epidural abscess may increase his risk for further infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
* Renal complications: The patient's history of kidney disease and recent creatinine level of 1.2 may increase his risk for further renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
* Pulmonary complications: The patient's history of COPD and recent respiratory support may increase his risk for further pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.

Assessment and Plan:

* The patient's cardiac arrest code status will be continued.
* He will be monitored for neurological improvement and treated for any neurological complications that arise.
* He will be treated with antibiotics for bacteremia and epidural abscess.
* He will be monitored for GI bleeding and treated with proton pump inhibitors to prevent further bleeding.
* He will be monitored for infection and treated with antibiotics as necessary.
* He will be monitored for renal complications and treated with dialysis if necessary.
* He will be monitored for pulmonary complications and treated with respiratory support as necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities, however may be
   necessary for ICD in future
   - d/c lidocaine gtt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  However, no EKG changes or significant elevation in
   cardiac enzymes that would be worrisome for ACS.  Prior to his arrest
   he had not been complaining of active chest pain. He had been continued
   on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate, and lisinopril but his ASA was
   held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
  Peaked yesterday
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocaine, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine).
   - Goal MAP > 60 with phenylephrine
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s to be updated re: UM function without LE function
   - continous EEG study
   - currently on fentanyl and versed for sedation
 sedation holiday
   - Head CT when warm
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - f/u with neurosurgery
   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori d6/14 last
   dose 11/19
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.
   - Transfuse for Hct<30
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole gtt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazole and tetracycline (Now Day 6, started [**2174-11-17**])
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaiac GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily
   - Ask social work to check-in

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation who was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest. He has been diagnosed with anteroseptal infarction and is being treated with medications to manage his condition. He is also being monitored for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities, and bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and anteroseptal infarction increase his risk of developing cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and heart failure.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's unresponsiveness to pain or verbal stimuli and the presence of an epidural abscess increase his risk of developing neurological complications, such as sepsis, meningitis, and brain abscess.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's mechanical ventilation and the presence of a tracheostomy increase his risk of developing respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and respiratory failure.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the presence of a nasogastric tube increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding, perforation, and sepsis.
5. Infection: The patient's presence of a epidural abscess and the possibility of a bacteremia increase his risk of developing infections, such as sepsis and meningitis.
6. Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and the presence of anticoagulant medications increase his risk of developing bleeding complications, such as intracranial bleeding and gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Renal complications: The patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and the presence of anticoagulant medications increase his risk of developing renal complications, such as acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is unstable, and he requires close monitoring and management. He should be treated with antibiotics to manage his suspected bacteremia and epidural abscess. He should also be managed with medications to control his cardiac arrhythmias and to prevent bleeding complications. He should be monitored for signs of infection, bleeding, and respiratory failure, and he should be treated promptly if any of these complications develop."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities, however may be
   necessary for ICD in future
   - D/C lidocaine ggt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  Possible new area of infarct that precipitated the VT
   arrest.  Prior to his arrest he had not been complaining of active
   chest pain. He had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate,
   and lisinopril but his ASA was held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
  Peaked yesterday
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocain, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine) initially but now stable without
   pressors.
   - Goal MAP>60 with phenylephrine
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s to be updated re: UM function without LE function
   - continous EEG study
   - currently on fentanyl and versed for sedation
 sedation holiday
   - Head CT when warm
   .
   .
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - f/u with neurosurgery
   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori d6/14 last
   dose 11/19
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.
   - Transfuse for Hct<30
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole ggt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazoe and clarithromycin (change to amox) (Now Day 5, started
   [**2174-11-17**])
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaic GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily
   - Ask social work to check-in

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abdonormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities
   - D/C lidocaine ggt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  Possible new area of infarct that precipitated the VT
   arrest.  Prior to his arrest he had not been complaining of active
   chest pain. He had been continued on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate,
   and lisinopril but his ASA was held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, which is suspected to be related to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) leading to anteroseptal infarction.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiovascular: The patient is on pressor support with phenylephrine, and his blood pressure is stable. He is also receiving anticoagulation therapy with heparin.
* Neurological: The patient is unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli and is undergoing an Arctic Sun protocol. He has a history of bacteremia and epidural abscess, which is being managed with antibiotics and neurosurgical follow-up.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is receiving proton pump inhibitors and antacids to manage acid reflux.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is receiving dialysis.
* Respiratory: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 23 cmH2O and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.
* Hemodynamic: The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 11 mmHg, and his mean arterial pressure (MAP) is 60 mmHg.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac condition is unstable, and he is at risk of developing further cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is unstable, and he is at risk of developing further neurological complications, such as brain edema, cerebral vasospasm, or seizures.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia and epidural abscess, and he is at risk of developing further infections, such as sepsis, pneumonia, or urinary tract infections.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is at risk of developing further gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation, abscess, or obstruction.
5. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is at risk of developing further renal complications, such as acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, or end-stage renal disease.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and he is at risk of developing further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, respiratory failure, or tracheostomy.
7. Hemodynamic complications: The patient's hemodynamic status is unstable, and he is at risk of developing further hemodynamic complications, such as hypotension, hypertension, or cardiac arrest.

To manage these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers, including cardiologists, neurologists, gastroenterologists, nephrologists, pulmonologists, and intensivists."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-inch tall male weighing 110.5 kg, who is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, morphine, and codeine.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 71 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 123/61 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 97% on 60% FiO2.

The patient has a diagnosis of bacteremia, impaired skin integrity, gastrointestinal bleed, cardiac arrest, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is receiving antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefipime, and cefazolin, as well as other medications such as dopamine, fentanyl, midazolam, and heparin.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate level, as well as abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes a code status of full code and a disposition of unknown.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis and septic shock due to the bacteremia and impaired skin integrity.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation due to the upper gastrointestinal bleed.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure due to the atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrest.
4. Respiratory failure due to the mechanical ventilation and the patient's underlying respiratory disease.
5. Infection and sepsis due to the central venous catheter and arterial line.
6. Renal failure due to the patient's underlying kidney disease and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
7. Hepatic failure due to the patient's underlying liver disease and the use of hepatotoxic medications.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and medical treatment. The patient's medical team should also consider the potential medical complications that can arise and take steps to prevent or manage them accordingly."

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 10807**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Extubated off pressors.
   Alert and communicative.
   Moves upper and lower ext to command.
   review of strips from arrest now suggests that rhythm may not be vent
   tachycardia but sinus tach with aberrrancy with primary mechanism PEA
   arrest.
   Medical Decision Making
   Neurosurgery planning drainage of epidural abscess tomorrow.
   Pt s/p CABG with no recent evidence of ischemia so no cardiac
   contraindication to proposed surgery.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 10807**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Extubated off pressors.
   Alert and communicative.
   Moves upper and lower ext to command.
   review of strips from arrest now suggests that rhythm may not be vent
   tachycardia but sinus tach with aberrrancy with primary mechanism PEA
   arrest.
   Medical Decision Making
   Neurosurgery planning drainage of epidural abscess tomorrow.
   Pt s/p CABG with no recent evidence of ischemia so no cardiac
   contraindication to proposed surgery.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 30 minutes of critical care time.

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, which was likely due to anesthetic effects, electrolyte abnormalities, or decompensated LV dysfunction. The patient has been extubated and is currently receiving invasive ventilation. He has a 1 cm epidural abscess, which is being managed by neurosurgery, and has a history of GI bleed and peripheral vascular disease.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he requires invasive ventilation. He may be at risk for respiratory failure, especially if his lung function deteriorates further.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of bacteremia and an epidural abscess, which increases his risk of developing sepsis.
3. GI bleed: The patient has a history of GI bleed, and his HCT levels are stable, but he may be at risk for further bleeding.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, which increases his risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and may be at risk for neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures.
6. Wound infection: The patient has a history of peripheral vascular disease and may be at risk for wound infection.
7. Asbestosis: The patient has a history of asbestos exposure and may be at risk for developing asbestosis.
8. Depression: The patient has a history of multiple medical issues and procedures, which may make it difficult for him to cope with his condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and correct any abnormalities.
3. Continue to manage the patient's GI bleed and monitor his HCT levels.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his medication regimen as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's wound and adjust his dressing as needed.
7. Consider referring the patient to a pulmonologist for further evaluation and management of his respiratory status.
8. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of his cardiac status.
9. Consider referring the patient to a neurologist for further evaluation and management of his neurological status.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's mental health and adjust his medication regimen as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Most likely ACS leading to anteroseptal infarction
   (given TTE findings and new onset VT). Alternative precipitants for his
   VT are unlikely and include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - defer cath for now given multiple comorbidities, however may be
   necessary for ICD in future
   - d/c lidocaine gtt for VT control
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   .
   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  However, no EKG changes or significant elevation in
   cardiac enzymes that would be worrisome for ACS.  Prior to his arrest
   he had not been complaining of active chest pain. He had been continued
   on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate, and lisinopril but his ASA was
   held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.
   - follow CE
  Peaked yesterday
   .
   # Hypotension: Differential includes cardiogenic shock in setting of VT
   or medication adverse event (lidocaine, amiodarone). Required pressor
   (initially DA then phenylephrine).
   - Goal MAP > 60 with phenylephrine
   .
   # Neurological signs: Unresponsive to pain or verbal stimuli. currently
   undergoing arctic sun protocol will need to monitor for neurological
   improvement.
   - neuro c/s to be updated re: UM function without LE function
   - continous EEG study
   - currently on fentanyl and versed for sedation
 sedation holiday
   - Head CT when warm
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - f/u with neurosurgery
   - Change from cefazolin to vanc/cefephime
   - continue flagyl and clarythromicin for presumtive h pylori d6/14 last
   dose 11/19
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.
   - Transfuse for Hct<30
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole gtt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazole and tetracycline (Now Day 6, started [**2174-11-17**])
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaiac GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Presumed ACS:  Echo after VT arrest showed new hypokinetic areas in
   anterior septal.  However, no EKG changes or significant elevation in
   cardiac enzymes that would be worrisome for ACS.  Prior to his arrest
   he had not been complaining of active chest pain. He had been continued
   on simvastatin, metoprolol tartrate, and lisinopril but his ASA was
   held due to GI bleed.
   - f/u final TTE results
   - medical management with ASA and heparin; continue statin; will add on
   bb and ACEi when his BP stabilizes. Will consider plavix, but he's at a
   significant risk of bleeding at this time.

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, likely due to an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) leading to anteroseptal infarction. He was also diagnosed with a bacteremia/epidural abscess, gastrointestinal bleed, and peripheral vascular disease. He has been treated with various medications, including heparin, pantoprazole, and metronidazole, and has undergone several procedures, including cardiac catheterization and wound care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Cardiogenic shock due to VT or medication adverse event
	* ACS leading to further infarction or arrhythmias
	* ICD implantation may be necessary in the future
2. Infection:
	* Bacteremia/epidural abscess may progress or recur
	* Gastrointestinal bleed may lead to sepsis or abscess formation
	* Wound infection or cellulitis may occur due to peripheral vascular disease
3. Neurological Complications:
	* Neurological signs of unresponsiveness may persist or worsen
	* Seizures or status epilepticus may occur due to electrolyte imbalances or medication toxicity
	* Cerebral edema or infarction may occur due to hypoxia or ischemia
4. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleed may recur or worsen
	* Sepsis or abscess formation may occur due to gastrointestinal infection
	* Malnutrition or electrolyte imbalances may occur due to inadequate nutrition or gastrointestinal dysfunction
5. Renal Complications:
	* Acute kidney injury may occur due to hypoperfusion or nephrotoxic medications
	* Chronic kidney disease may worsen due to underlying conditions or medications
6. Respiratory Complications:
	* Respiratory failure may occur due to pneumonia, aspiration, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
	* Pneumonia or aspiration may occur due to altered mental status or respiratory failure
7. Hematological Complications:
	* Bleeding or thrombocytopenia may occur due to anticoagulation or platelet dysfunction
	* Anemia or thrombocytosis may occur due to underlying conditions or medications
8. Psychiatric Complications:
	* Depression or anxiety may worsen due to underlying conditions or medications
	* Delirium or cognitive impairment may occur due to medication toxicity, infection, or hypoxia

These potential complications highlight the complexity of the patient's condition and the need for close monitoring and management to prevent or treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology.  Unlikely to be ACS in the setting
   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - replete Mg, Ca, K prn and correct any acidosis
   - arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   - once other comorbidities have stabilized, may benefit from ICD
   placement
   .
   # Neurological signs: Improved s/p extubation and completion of arctic
   sun protocol.
   - neuro c/s
   - head CT unremarkable
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - NSGY may take patient to OR Friday.  Per discussion with team and
   attending, patient is a moderate risk candidate for a moderate risk
   surgery and does not warrant stress test or cardiac catherization
   pre-operatively for clearance.
   - on cefazolin
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy today but
   this postponed for cardiac arrest.
   - Transfuse for Hct<30
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole gtt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazole and tetracycline (Now Day 7, started [**2174-11-17**])
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaiac GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology.  Unlikely to be ACS in the setting
   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - s/p arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   - once other comorbidities have stabilized, may benefit from ICD
   placement
   .
   # Neurological signs: Improved s/p extubation and completion of arctic
   sun protocol.
   - head CT unremarkable
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.  If attempt fails,
   NSGY will consider taking patient to OR.  Per discussion with team and
   attending, patient is a moderate risk candidate for a moderate risk
   surgery and does not warrant stress test or cardiac catherization
   pre-operatively for clearance.
   - on cefazolin
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy before
   cardiac arrest.
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - Pantoprazole gtt
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazole and tetracycline (Now Day 7, started [**2174-11-17**]).  Stopped
   clarithromycin for QTc prolongation.
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaiac GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and a recent cardiac arrest. He is currently in the ICU for monitoring and treatment of multiple comorbidities.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, and blood pressure of 107/55 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 93% on nasal cannula.

The patient has undergone several procedures, including a cardiac arrest, and is currently receiving treatment for bacteremia/epidural abscess, gastrointestinal bleed, and peripheral vascular disease.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase, indicating possible inflammation or infection. His blood glucose levels are within normal range, but his electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's bacteremia/epidural abscess and gastrointestinal bleed may lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, or death if not properly treated.
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease may increase his risk of cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction.
3. Neurological Complications: The patient's recent cardiac arrest and bacteremia/epidural abscess may lead to neurological deficits or cognitive impairment.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed may lead to further bleeding, perforation, or stricture formation.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation may indicate early signs of respiratory failure or pneumonia.
6. Renal Complications: The patient's elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels may indicate kidney damage or dysfunction.
7. Wound Complications: The patient's peripheral vascular disease and ulcer on his right foot may lead to further wound complications or infection.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires ongoing monitoring and treatment of his multiple comorbidities. His bacteremia/epidural abscess requires IR-guided drainage, and his gastrointestinal bleed requires continued treatment with pantoprazole and monitoring for bleeding. His peripheral vascular disease requires ongoing wound care and management of his ulcer. His type II diabetes requires continued management with diet and medication. His cardiac history requires ongoing monitoring and treatment of his atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease.

The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU for further monitoring and treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology.  Unlikely to be ACS in the setting
   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - s/p arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   - once other comorbidities have stabilized, may benefit from ICD
   placement
   .
   # Neurological signs: Improved s/p extubation and completion of arctic
   sun protocol.  Now appears at baseline.
   - head CT unremarkable
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.  If attempt fails,
   NSGY will consider taking patient to OR.  Per discussion with team and
   attending, patient is a moderate risk candidate for a moderate risk
   surgery and does not warrant stress test or cardiac catherization
   pre-operatively for clearance.
   - on cefazolin
   .
   # atrial fibrillation: Patient in chronic atrial fibrillation, came
   back into sinus rhythm after shock s/p cardiac arrest.  Was started on
   heparin gtt with plan for 4 weeks of anticoagulation s/p conversion,
   but given patient
s h/o GIB it was decided that we would instead treat
   with full-strength ASA (from 81 mg) for 4 weeks, with plan to lower
   down to 81 mg after 4 weeks for prevention of CVA.
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy before
   cardiac arrest.
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - switch to IV bid PPI
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazole and tetracycline (Now Day 9, started [**2174-11-17**]).  Stopped
   clarithromycin for QTc prolongation.
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaiac GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily
   - Ask social work to check-in

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest and has been treated for bacteremia/epidural abscess, atrial fibrillation, GI bleed, and peripheral vascular disease.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 107/55 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 93%. His respiratory support includes a peak inspiratory pressure of 24 cmH2O and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with a slightly elevated creatinine level. His liver function tests are within normal limits, and his electrolyte levels are normal.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Bacteremia/epidural abscess: The patient has been treated with cefazolin and has shown improvement. However, the source of the infection is unclear, and the patient is at risk for complications.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is in chronic atrial fibrillation and has been started on heparin and aspirin. He is at risk for stroke and bleeding.
3. GI bleed: The patient has had a GI bleed and is at risk for further bleeding. He is receiving IV proton pump inhibitor therapy and is being monitored for signs of bleeding.
4. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient has severe peripheral vascular disease and is at risk for further complications, including amputation.
5. Type 2 diabetes: The patient's blood sugar levels are well-controlled, but he is at risk for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
6. Mesothelioma: The patient has pleural thickening and calcified pleural plaques, which are consistent with possible asbestosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to his bacteremia/epidural abscess and GI bleed.
2. Stroke: The patient is at risk for stroke due to his atrial fibrillation and previous cardiac arrest.
3. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for further bleeding due to his GI bleed and atrial fibrillation.
4. Amputation: The patient is at risk for amputation due to his peripheral vascular disease.
5. Hypoglycemia: The patient is at risk for hypoglycemia due to his type 2 diabetes and medication regimen.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient is at risk for hyperglycemia due to his type 2 diabetes and medication regimen.

In conclusion, the patient is a complex case with multiple medical conditions and potential complications. He requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve his outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest, which was likely due to anesthetic for an MRI procedure, electrolyte abnormalities, or decompensated LV dysfunction. He has undergone several surgeries, including CABG and has a history of GI bleed, bacteremia/epidural abscess, and peripheral vascular disease.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 36.6°C, HR 64 bpm, BP 107/55 mmHg, RR 18 inspirations per minute, SpO2 93%.
* Laboratory results: WBC 7.5, Hct 30.3, Plt 222, Cr 1.2, TCO2 22, Glucose 89.
* Medications: Beta blocker, pantoprazole, heparin, hydromorphone, and metronidazole.
* Plan: The patient is scheduled for an IR-guided drainage of an abscess today, and if that fails, neurosurgery will consider taking him to OR. He is also being monitored for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities, and bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleed and is currently on anticoagulant therapy with heparin. He also has a risk of bleeding due to his platelet count of 222.
2. Infection: The patient has a bacteremia/epidural abscess and is at risk of developing further infections.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation, and is at risk of developing further cardiovascular complications.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of severe peripheral vascular disease and is at risk of developing respiratory complications.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of neurological signs and is at risk of developing further neurological complications.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of GI bleed and is at risk of developing further gastrointestinal complications.
7. Wound complications: The patient has a wound on his medial plantar right foot and is at risk of developing wound complications.
8. Mesothelioma: The patient has a history of pleural thickening and is at risk of developing mesothelioma.

Overall, the patient is at high risk of developing further medical complications due to his complex medical history and current condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.

   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.

   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   - once other comorbidities have stabilized, may benefit from ICD
   placement
   .
   # Neurological signs: Improved s/p extubation and completion of arctic
   sun protocol.  Now appears at baseline.
   - head CT unremarkable
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.  If attempt fails,

   - on cefazolin
   .
   # atrial fibrillation: Patient in chronic atrial fibrillation, came
   back into sinus rhythm after shock s/p cardiac arrest.  Was started on
   heparin gtt with plan for 4 weeks of anticoagulation s/p conversion,
   but given patient
s h/o GIB it was decided that we would instead treat
   with full-strength ASA (from 81 mg) for 4 weeks, with plan to lower

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 78-year-old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation, was transferred to the CCU after a cardiac arrest. The patient's cardiac arrest was unclear in etiology, but alternative precipitants were considered, including anesthetic for his MRI procedure, electrolyte abnormalities, or decompensated LV dysfunction.

The patient's neurological signs have improved since extubation and completion of the Arctic Sun protocol, and he now appears at baseline. A head CT was unremarkable, and an MRI showed a 1-cm abscess, which is planned to be drained via IR-guided drainage today. If the attempt fails, NSGY will consider taking the patient to the OR.

The patient has a history of bacteremia/epidural abscess, with BCx positive for MSSA on November 6, and daily BCx have been negative since then. The source is unclear, but skin ulcers are suspected.

The patient's atrial fibrillation was converted to sinus rhythm after shock s/p cardiac arrest, and he was started on heparin with a plan for 4 weeks of anticoagulation. However, due to his history of GIB, it was decided to treat with full-strength ASA instead.

The patient has a history of GI bleed, which was treated with IV access, PIV and triple lumen, and T+C+C. He was also started on IV bid PPI and a 2-week course of metronidazole and tetracycline.

The patient has peripheral vascular disease, with an ulcer on the medial plantar right foot, which is being treated with wound care per podiatry/vascular recommendations.

The patient's type 2 diabetes is diet-controlled, with last HbA1c being 5.7%. He has not required insulin while in the house.

The patient has a history of possible mesothelioma, with pleural thickening noted on his chest CT, and bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis on his CXR.

The patient's depression is being managed with celexa 20 mg daily, and social work is being asked to check-in.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Sepsis or septic shock due to bacteremia or abscess.
2. Bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy or GI bleed.
3. Cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, due to atrial fibrillation or coronary artery disease.
4. Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure, due to respiratory support or underlying lung disease.
5. Neurological complications, such as stroke or seizures, due to cardiac arrest or underlying neurological conditions.
6. Gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation or bleeding, due to GI disease or surgery.
7. Wound complications, such as infection or dehiscence, due to peripheral vascular disease or surgery.
8. Infection complications, such as pneumonia or UTI, due to compromised immune system or underlying medical conditions.
9. Cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias, due to decompensated LV dysfunction or underlying cardiac conditions.
10. Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease, due to underlying medical conditions or nephrotoxic medications."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology.  Unlikely to be ACS in the setting
   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - s/p arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   - once other comorbidities have stabilized, may benefit from ICD
   placement in the outpatient setting
   .
   # Neurological signs: Improved s/p extubation and completion of arctic
   sun protocol.  Now appears at baseline.
   - head CT unremarkable
   - appearrs at baseline
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.  If attempt fails,
   NSGY will consider taking patient to OR.  Per discussion with team and
   attending, patient is a moderate risk candidate for a moderate risk
   surgery and does not warrant stress test or cardiac catherization
   pre-operatively for clearance.
   - on cefazolin
   - NSG on monday
   .
   # atrial fibrillation: Patient in chronic atrial fibrillation, came
   back into sinus rhythm after shock s/p cardiac arrest.  Was started on
   heparin gtt with plan for 4 weeks of anticoagulation s/p conversion,
   but given patient
s h/o GIB, we are changing to 81 ASA
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy before
   cardiac arrest.
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - switch to IV bid PPI
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazole and tetracycline (Now Day 9, started [**2174-11-17**]).  Stopped
   clarithromycin for QTc prolongation.
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaiac GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and a recent cardiac arrest. He is currently in the ICU and has undergone several medical procedures, including an MRI, cardiac catheterization, and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is of unclear etiology, and alternative precipitants include anesthetic for his MRI procedure, electrolyte abnormalities, or decompensated LV dysfunction.
2. Bacteremia/epidural abscess: The patient has a positive BCx for MSSA, and an MRI has confirmed a 1-cm abscess. The plan is for IR-guided drainage of the abscess today, and if the attempt fails, NSGY will consider taking the patient to the OR.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is in chronic atrial fibrillation, and was started on heparin gtt with a plan for 4 weeks of anticoagulation. However, given his history of GIB, we are changing to 81 ASA.
4. GI bleed: The patient has a history of GIB and was supposed to have a colonoscopy before his cardiac arrest. He is currently receiving IV access, T+C+C, and switch to IV bid PPI.
5. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has a wound on his medial plantar right foot and is receiving wound care per podiatry/vascular recommendations.
6. Type 2 diabetes: The patient's diabetes is diet-controlled, and his last HbA1c was 5.7%.
7. Mesothelioma: The patient has pleural thickening on his Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma. He will be followed up with Thoracic Surgery as an outpatient.
8. Depression: The patient is experiencing depression due to his multiple medical issues and procedures, and is receiving celexa 20 mg daily.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's bacteremia and abscess, there is a risk of sepsis developing.
2. Bleeding: The patient's history of GIB and the use of anticoagulation therapy increase his risk of bleeding.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and atrial fibrillation increase his risk of cardiac complications, such as ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac failure.
4. GI complications: The patient's history of GIB and the use of anticoagulation therapy increase his risk of GI complications, such as bleeding and perforation.
5. Wound complications: The patient's wound on his medial plantar right foot is at risk of developing complications, such as infection and dehiscence.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and atrial fibrillation increase his risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia and respiratory failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and the use of anticoagulation therapy increase his risk of neurological complications, such as stroke and seizures.

Based on the patient's complex medical history and current medical issues, it is essential to monitor him closely and adjust his treatment plan as needed to prevent and manage potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology.  Unlikely to be ACS in the setting
   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - s/p arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   - once other comorbidities have stabilized, may benefit from ICD
   placement in the outpatient setting
   .
   # Neurological signs: Improved s/p extubation and completion of arctic
   sun protocol.  Now appears at baseline.
   - head CT unremarkable
   - appearrs at baseline
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.  If attempt fails,
   NSGY will consider taking patient to OR.  Per discussion with team and
   attending, patient is a moderate risk candidate for a moderate risk
   surgery and does not warrant stress test or cardiac catherization
   pre-operatively for clearance.
   - on cefazolin
   - NSG on monday
   .
   # atrial fibrillation: Patient in chronic atrial fibrillation, came
   back into sinus rhythm after shock s/p cardiac arrest.  Was started on
   heparin gtt with plan for 4 weeks of anticoagulation s/p conversion,
   but given patient
s h/o GIB, we are changing to 81 ASA
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy before
   cardiac arrest.
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - switch to IV bid PPI
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazole and tetracycline (Now Day 9, started [**2174-11-17**]).  Stopped
   clarithromycin for QTc prolongation.
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaiac GT, Stools
   .
   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS
   .
   # ? Mesothelioma: Pleural thickening (in the setting of prior asbestos
   exposure) noted on [**2174-11-6**] Chest CT, concerning for mesothelioma.
   Bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis
   on CXR [**2174-11-17**].
   - Follow-up with Thoracic Surgery, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] as outpatient
   .
   # Depression: Given multiple medical issues and procedures, coping may
   be difficult.
   - Continue celexa 20 mg daily

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and a history of cardiac arrest. He was transferred to the ICU after a cardiac arrest and has been receiving treatment for various conditions, including bacteremia, epidural abscess, atrial fibrillation, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Temperature 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate 61 beats per minute, blood pressure 144/76 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%.
* Laboratory results: White blood cell count 7.5 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin 9.5 g/dL, platelet count 192 x 10^9/L, and creatinine 1.2 mg/dL.
* Imaging studies: A head CT scan was unremarkable, and a chest CT scan showed pleural thickening and bilateral calcified pleural plaques consistent with possible asbestosis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Coagulopathy: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to his history of cardiac arrest, bacteremia, and epidural abscess.
2. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored due to his history of cardiac arrest and the use of certain medications.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and should be monitored for signs of bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of bacteremia and epidural abscess, and should be monitored for signs of infection.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and should be monitored for signs of cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Renal insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and his kidney function should be closely monitored.
7. Wound complications: The patient has a history of wound care and should be monitored for signs of wound complications.
8. Asbestosis: The patient has a history of asbestos exposure and should be monitored for signs of asbestosis.

Assessment and plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. The patient should be continued on antibiotics for bacteremia and epidural abscess, and should be monitored for signs of infection. The patient's electrolyte levels should be closely monitored, and his kidney function should be assessed regularly. The patient's wound care should be continued, and he should be monitored for signs of wound complications. The patient's cardiac status should be closely monitored, and he should be considered for ICD placement in the outpatient setting. The patient's depression should be managed with medication and social work support."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology.  Unlikely to be ACS in the setting
   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - s/p arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   - once other comorbidities have stabilized, may benefit from ICD
   placement in the outpatient setting
   .
   # Neurological signs: Improved s/p extubation and completion of arctic
   sun protocol.  Now appears at baseline.
   - head CT unremarkable
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.  If attempt fails,
   NSGY will consider taking patient to OR.  Per discussion with team and
   attending, patient is a moderate risk candidate for a moderate risk
   surgery and does not warrant stress test or cardiac catherization
   pre-operatively for clearance.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   78 year old male with type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular
   disease, coronary artery disease s/p CABG and atrial fibrillation  who
   is transfered to CCU after a cardiac arrest.
   .
   # Cardiac arrest: Unclear etiology.  Unlikely to be ACS in the setting
   of flat CE, no EKG changes, no c/o chest pain.  Alternative
   precipitants for his VT could include anesthetic for his MRI procedure,
   electrolyte abnormalities or decompensated LV dysfunction.
   - s/p arctic sun protocol; patient now warmed
   - monitor for coagulopathy, electrolyte abnormalities & bleeding
   - once other comorbidities have stabilized, may benefit from ICD
   placement in the outpatient setting
   .
   # Neurological signs: Improved s/p extubation and completion of arctic
   sun protocol.  Now appears at baseline.
   - head CT unremarkable
   .
   # Bacteremia/epidural abscess: BCx positive on [**11-6**] for MSSA, neg
   daily since, last BCx [**2174-11-12**]. Source unclear but suspect skin ulcers.
   MRI positive for 1 cm abscess, neurosurgery has been followed.
   - plan is for IR-guided drainage of abscess today.  If attempt fails,
   NSGY will consider taking patient to OR.  Per discussion with team and
   attending, patient is a moderate risk candidate for a moderate risk
   surgery and does not warrant stress test or cardiac catherization
   pre-operatively for clearance.
   - on cefazolin

   .
   # atrial fibrillation: Patient in chronic atrial fibrillation, came
   back into sinus rhythm after shock s/p cardiac arrest.  Was started on
   heparin gtt with plan for 4 weeks of anticoagulation s/p conversion,
   but given patient
s h/o GIB, we are changing to 81 ASA
   .
   # elevated INR: Patient noted to have uptrending INR during
   hospitalization despite being off coumadin since admission.  [**Month (only) 60**] be [**2-14**]
   nutritional deficiencies.  Will give PO Vit K.
   .
   # GI bleed: s/p GIB on [**2174-11-15**], HCT stable since then. Know peptic
   ulcers that are healing. Was supposed to have colonoscopy before
   cardiac arrest.
   - IV access pIV and triple lumen
   - T+C+C
   - IV bid PPI
   - Since H. Pylori serologies equivocal, continue 2 week course of
   metronidazole and tetracycline (Now Day 10, started [**2174-11-17**]).  Stopped
   clarithromycin for QTc prolongation.
   - Monitor for bleeding
   - Guaiac GT, Stools

   # Peripheral Vascular Disease: s/p multiple surgeries, currently with
   ulcer on medial plantar right foot previously followed by podiatry and
   vascular.
   - Wound care per podiatry/vascular recs - clean dry dressing
   .
   #  Type 2 diabetes: Diet controlled, last HbA1c was 5.7%. Has not
   required insulin while in house.
   - Diabetic diet, RISS

Summary:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a complex medical history, including type II diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest of unclear etiology. The patient has undergone several medical procedures, including cardiac catheterization, coronary artery bypass grafting, and MRI procedures.

Recent events include:

* Arterial line and multi-lumen stoppage
* I/R procedure yielded 1cc of purulent/bloody fluid
* Plan for NSGY procedure on Monday, including discontinuation of SQ heparin
* Switch to oxycodone for pain management
* Flagyl changed to IV to reduce pill burden
* Triple lumen from code pulled

Lab results show:

* WBC: 7.5-6.0 K/uL
* Hct: 30.3-28.7%
* Plt: 222-192 K/uL
* Cr: 1.2-1.0 mg/dL
* TCO2: 23-24 mmHg
* Glucose: 89-76 mg/dL

* Coagulopathy due to heparin therapy and possible bleeding
* Electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia
* Decompensated LV dysfunction and cardiac arrest
* Bacteremia and sepsis due to MSSA infection
* GI bleeding and peptic ulcer disease
* Peripheral vascular disease and wound complications
* Type 2 diabetes and potential diabetic ketoacidosis
* Mesothelioma and asbestosis
* Depression and coping difficulties
* Dysphagia and malnutrition

Plan:

* Continue heparin therapy with close monitoring for bleeding and coagulopathy
* Monitor for electrolyte abnormalities and adjust therapy as necessary
* Continue antibiotic therapy for MSSA infection
* Monitor for GI bleeding and peptic ulcer disease, and adjust therapy as necessary
* Continue wound care and monitoring for peripheral vascular disease
* Monitor blood glucose levels and adjust therapy as necessary
