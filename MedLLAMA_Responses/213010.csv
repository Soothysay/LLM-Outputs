   52 y/o lady with hyptension presented to the Emergency Department with
   swollen tongue and funny feeling in her tongue and was intubated for
   airway protection.
   .
   # Angioedema:  Presentation consistent with anioedema and/or allergic
   reactioin.  Normal eos and only lip,cheeks,tongue swelling argues for
   angioedema.  Anesthesiologist who intubated her did not notice any
   airway swelling, all upper airway.  Has been on lisinopril since
   [**2127-1-23**].  History of using NSAIDS prn. No known new
   exposures.  SVC syndrome will be lower in the differential given no
   upper extremity swelling.  However she is on OCP.  No signs or symptoms
   of infection.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU due to angioedema, a severe allergic reaction that caused swelling of her lips, cheeks, and tongue. She was intubated for airway protection and has been receiving treatment with steroids, antihistamines, and other medications. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains hypertensive and has a history of hypertension. She also has a history of asthma, anemia, and chronic uterine fibroids.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's angioedema may lead to respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure, due to the swelling of her airways. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to maintain her airway.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypertension and history of hypertension may increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or myocardial infarction.
3. Neurological Complications: The patient's sedation and intubation may lead to neurological complications, such as delirium, seizures, or stroke.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's anemia and history of chronic uterine fibroids may increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or obstruction.
5. Infection: The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation may increase her risk of infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Bleeding: The patient's anticoagulation therapy and history of hypertension may increase her risk of bleeding, particularly in the setting of surgery or invasive procedures.
7. Anaphylaxis: The patient's history of multiple allergies and anaphylaxis may increase her risk of anaphylaxis during future exposures to allergens.
8. Sarcoidosis: The patient's hilar lymphadenopathy on CXR may indicate the presence of sarcoidosis, a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs.

Overall, the patient's medical condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is still compromised, and there is a risk of respiratory failure due to angioedema, airway edema, and potential vocal cord edema.
2. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect her airway increases the risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and other complications.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is not well-controlled, and there is a risk of hypertensive crisis if not managed properly.
4. Hilar lymphadenopathy: The patient's CXR shows hilar lymphadenopathy, which may be an incidental finding or a sign of underlying sarcoidosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of this finding.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia is secondary to chronic uterine fibroids, and there is a risk of further anemia if not managed properly.
6. Thromboembolic complications: The patient is at risk of developing thromboembolic complications due to her immobility and underlying medical conditions.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to her compromised immune system and prolonged hospital stay.
8. Steroid-induced complications: The patient is receiving steroids, which can lead to steroid-induced complications such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
9. Allergic reactions: The patient has a history of multiple allergies, and there is a risk of allergic reactions to medications, food, or other substances.
10. Airway complications: The patient's airway is still compromised, and there is a risk of airway complications such as tracheal stenosis, vocal cord edema, or respiratory failure if not managed properly.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should be closely monitored and managed in the ICU, with regular assessments of her respiratory status, blood pressure, and other vital signs. The patient's allergies should be carefully managed, and any medications should be carefully titrated to minimize the risk of adverse reactions. Further evaluation and management of the patient's hilar lymphadenopathy, anemia, and hypertension are also necessary to ensure optimal care."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of invasive ventilation due to angioedema. The patient is intubated and receiving propofol, midazolam, and fentanyl for continued agitation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 126/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 100%. The patient is receiving fluids, with a total fluid input of 1630 mL and output of 1425 mL, resulting in a balance of 205 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, platelet count of 199 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, and glucose of 97 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the intubation, but the skin, peripheral vascular, neurologic, and respiratory systems are not assessed.

The patient's assessment and plan indicate an inability to protect the airway due to angioedema, secondary to a history of asthma, hypertension, and benign. The patient is at risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, airway clearance, and cough.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.
2. Aspiration pneumonia due to the patient's inability to protect the airway.
3. Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's immunocompromised state and the presence of angioedema.
4. Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying lung disease and the need for prolonged mechanical ventilation.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's history of hypertension and benign, and the use of anticoagulant therapy with heparin.
6. Bloodstream infections due to the patient's central venous catheter and the use of antibiotics.
7. Delirium or agitation due to the patient's sedation and the need for mechanical ventilation.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 52-year-old female who was intubated for airway protection due to angioedema and/or allergic reaction. She has a history of hypertension, asthma, and anemia secondary to chronic uterine fibroids. She is currently on multiple medications, including steroids, antihistamines, and antacids. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, and blood pressure of 126/76 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals swollen lips, asymmetric swelling of the cheeks, and a soft abdomen. Her neurologic examination is limited due to sedation, and her peripheral vascular examination is incomplete due to inability to assess pulses. Her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated eosinophil count.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Angioedema: The patient's presentation is consistent with angioedema, and she is being treated with steroids, antihistamines, and antacids.
2. Intubation: The patient is intubated for airway protection, and weaning down FiO2 is planned.
3. Multiple allergies: The patient has a history of multiple allergies, and management is being approached as above.
4. Hypertension: The patient is currently hypertensive, and medication will be started with caution given her allergy history.
5. Interesting CXR: An incidental finding on the patient's chest X-ray needs outpatient follow-up.
6. Asthma: The patient's lung fields are clear, and nebs are being used as needed.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is secondary to chronic uterine fibroids, and OCP will be held during the acute phase.
8. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin, famotidine, and ISS while on steroids.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient's intubation and ventilation may lead to respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or respiratory failure.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and potential medication side effects may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as hypertension, arrhythmias, or cardiac failure.
3. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's use of antacids and steroids may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's sedation and potential medication side effects may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures, delirium, or altered mental status.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppression and prolonged hospitalization may increase the risk of infection, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or sepsis.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's use of anticoagulants and potential medication side effects may lead to bleeding complications, such as bleeding from the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent these potential complications and ensure her optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with angioedema, hypertension, and multiple allergies. She was intubated for airway protection and was treated with steroids, antihistamines, and antacids. Her condition has improved, and she was extubated. She is currently on low-dose amlodipine for hypertension and will be discharged to the floor for further BP management. She has a history of asthma, hypertension, and anemia secondary to chronic uterine fibroids.

Potential medical complications:

1. Airway complications: The patient's angioedema and airway swelling pose a risk of aspiration, altered gag reflex, and impaired airway clearance, which may lead to respiratory complications.
2. Anaphylaxis: The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to multiple substances, including penicillins, codeine, and shellfish-derived products, and may be at risk of another anaphylactic reaction.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure, if not adequately managed.
4. Asthma: The patient's asthma may exacerbate if not properly managed, leading to respiratory complications such as bronchospasm, wheezing, or respiratory failure.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's use of antacids and antihistamines may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as constipation, diarrhea, or nausea.
6. Infection: The patient's use of prophylactic antibiotics and antifungals may increase the risk of infection, particularly in the respiratory tract.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's use of heparin for prophylaxis may increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, particularly in the legs.
8. Nutritional complications: The patient's NPO status and use of antacids may lead to nutritional deficiencies, particularly in electrolytes and vitamins.
9. Psychological complications: The patient's hospitalization and treatment may lead to psychological complications such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."

     * hilar LAD on cxr
   Angioedema largely resolved.  Still with mild R facial swelling.  Will
   continue benadryl, H2B.  Decrease steroids to prednisone 40 and taper
   over next few days. Remains on ISS while on steroids though needs
   should improved with decreased steroid dose.  Allergy input
   appreciated.  Allergy labs pending and will need allergy outpt f/u.  BP
   mildly elevated as holding ace-1.  Will start low dose calcium channel

   52 y/o lady with hyptension presented to the Emergency Department with
   swollen tongue and funny feeling in her tongue and was intubated for
   airway protection.
   .
   # Angioedema:  No clear etiology, although most likely would be
   lisinopril which was held on admission as well as NSAIDs. Today some
   mild right facial swelling but much improved overall since yesterday.
   Will continue with steroid treatment, switch to Po prednisone with
   taper.
   - po prednisone 60mg qd with 5 day taper
   - diphenhydramine po, famotidine po
   - f/u pending allergy labs
   -f/u allergy recs
   .
   # Multiple allergies: Consulted allergy. Will follow up recs and
   pending labs.
   .
   # Hypertension:  Currently hypertensive. Will start amlodipine po at
   low dose and monitor for a day prior to d/c.
   -          amlodipine 5mg po qd
   -          monitor BP
   .
   # hilar lymphadenopathy on  CXR:  Interesting incidental finding on
   CXR. Seen on previous films. Will email PCP to ensure this is followed
   up appropriately. Will likely need a chest CP as outpatient.
   .
   # Asthma:  Clear lung fields currently.
   - nebs prn
   .
   # Anemia: secondary to chonic uterine fibroids.
   - ok to restart OCP as unlikely to be cause of angioedema

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   [**Known lastname **]
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 52 yo F presents with angioedema, intubated
   for airway protection. Received steroids, H2B, benadryl, nebs. Ace-I
   held. Significant improvement in tongue and mucosal (lip) swelling.
   Extubated successfully yesterday.
   Exam notable for Tm 99.1 BP 146/80 HR 68 RR 12 with sat 99-100% on RA
   (40%) .
   Alert awake following commands, no evidence of tongue, lip edema, face
   appears assymmetric--+ mild edema at R cheek, no stridor, CTA without
   wheeze, RR, obese, benign abd
   Labs
no new, allergy labs pending
   CXR with ET in position LAD in hilum, no focal pna
   Issues include:
     * angioedema
     * respiratory failure (airway control) --extubated
     * asthma
     * htn
     * hilar LAD on cxr
   Angioedema largely resolved.  Still with mild R facial swelling.  Will
   continue benadryl, H2B.  Decrease steroids to prednisone 40 and taper
   over next few days. Remains on ISS while on steroids though needs
   should improved with decreased steroid dose.  Allergy input
   appreciated.  Allergy labs pending and will need allergy outpt f/u.  BP
   mildly elevated as holding ace-1.  Will start low dose calcium channel
   blocker.
   Stable for floor transfer.
   Will need outpt ct chest for further eval of hilar lad evident on cxr.

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the key points as follows:

* The patient is a 52-year-old female who presented to the Emergency Department with swollen tongue and a funny feeling in her tongue, leading to intubation for airway protection.
* She has a history of hypertension, asthma, and multiple allergies, including anaphylaxis to certain medications.
* The patient was extubated successfully yesterday and is currently on steroids, H2 blockers, and antihistamines to manage her angioedema.
* She has mild right facial swelling but is otherwise improving.
* The patient has hypertension, which is being managed with amlodipine, and is at risk for aspiration due to her airway issues.
* The patient has a history of asthma, which is currently well-controlled.
* The patient has hilar lymphadenopathy on her CXR, which will require further evaluation and follow-up.
* The patient's anemia is secondary to chronic uterine fibroids and is not related to her angioedema.
* The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer due to her medications and medical conditions.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to airway issues and aspiration risk
* Anaphylaxis to certain medications or allergens
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Stress ulcer and gastrointestinal bleeding
* Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)
* Infection due to prolonged hospitalization and immobility
* Hypertension-related complications, such as cardiac failure or stroke
* Angioedema-related complications, such as airway obstruction or cardiac arrest
* Delayed or inadequate treatment of her underlying medical conditions, such as hypertension, asthma, and anemia."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient was extubated from invasive ventilation and is currently on CPAP with oxygen delivery. They have a history of multiple allergies, including anaphylaxis to penicillins, codeine, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. The patient is receiving medications for allergy prophylaxis, including steroids, pepcid, and benadryl. They have been experiencing a stable vital sign profile, with a slight decrease in temperature. The patient's fluid balance is within normal limits, and they are receiving IV fluids and antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Airway compromise: Given the patient's history of angioedema and anaphylaxis, there is a risk of airway compromise, which could lead to aspiration, altered gag reflex, and impaired airway clearance.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of asthma and hypertension, as well as their current use of CPAP, increases their risk of respiratory failure.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of hypertension and their current use of medications such as heparin sodium for prophylaxis may increase their risk of cardiovascular complications, such as bleeding or arrhythmias.
4. Infection: The patient's current use of antibiotics and their history of previous infections increase their risk of developing a new infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Hematological complications: The patient's history of anemia and their current use of medications such as heparin sodium may increase their risk of bleeding or hematological complications.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of asthma and their current use of medications such as pepcid and benadryl may increase their risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of anaphylaxis and their current use of medications such as benadryl may increase their risk of neurological complications, such as seizures or altered mental status.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, airway status, and fluid balance, as well as to adjust their medication regimen as needed to minimize the risk of these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 52-year-old woman who was intubated for airway protection due to angioedema and/or allergic reaction. She has a history of hypertension, asthma, and taking lisinopril and NSAIDs. She was recently started on steroids, diphenhydramine, and famotidine for management of angioedema. The patient was extubated yesterday and is currently on CPAP with FiO2 40%. Her vital signs are stable, and her lab results show normal WBC count, Hct, and Plt count.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration: The patient is at risk for aspiration due to her inability to protect her airway, which may lead to respiratory complications.
2. Anaphylaxis: The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to certain medications and foods, which may recur during her hospital stay.
3. Angioedema: The patient's angioedema may worsen or recur during her hospital stay, leading to airway obstruction and respiratory compromise.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may not be well-controlled due to her allergy to certain medications, which may lead to cardiac complications.
5. Sarcoidosis: The patient's hilar lymphadenopathy on CXR may be indicative of sarcoidosis, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of NSAIDs and steroids may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's immobilization and medical conditions may increase her risk of developing venous thromboembolism.
8. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and medical conditions may increase her risk of developing infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's airway and respiratory status closely.
2. Provide close monitoring of the patient's vital signs and lab results.
3. Continue to manage the patient's angioedema with steroids, diphenhydramine, and famotidine.
4. Consider starting the patient on a short-acting calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, for hypertension management.
5. Obtain a CT scan to further evaluate the patient's hilar lymphadenopathy.
6. Consider prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely and consider prophylactic acid suppression therapy.
8. Consider starting the patient on antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce the risk of infection."
