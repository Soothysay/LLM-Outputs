   Assessment and Plan
   76 year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung cancer
   who presented to OSH with syncope and black stool x 2 without clear
   source of bleed on EGD, now transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for enteroscopy and
   colonoscopy.
   .
   # GIB:  Given black stool, likely upper source.  As outlined above,
   initial EGD showed nonbleeding duodenal ulcer, but repeat scope showed
   duodenitis without evidence of ulceration.  Given GIB with HD
   instability (hypotensive, tachy, requiring 3 u prbcs), seems unlikely
   to be from sources visualized.  Thus, may likely be from small bowel
   AVM vs. ulceration distal to segments scoped.  Given no BRBPR, seems
   less likely lower source, but right sided colonic source is certainly
   possible.  Prepped already for [**Last Name (un) **] at [**Hospital3 1959**].  Currently HD
   stable.

   - NPO p MN for enteroscopy and colonoscopy
   - maintain 2 PIVs
   - monitor q6h hcts

   # Anemia:  Chronic anemia likely [**2-2**] to malignancy (baseline hct
   unknown), now with acute drop from blood loss.  Received 2 units during
   his [**Date range (1) 2759**] admission and then an additional 3 units since [**10-16**].
   - management as above
   .
   # Candidal esophagitis:  Although none noted on repeat EGD, has
   received approximately 3 days of fluconazole and nystatin.  Patient
   without any symptoms of dysphagia or odynophagia.
   - will continue fluconazole and nystatin for now
   - address with GI duration of therapy (normally 14-21 days) given no
   signs of esophagitis on repeat scope just days after initial (? clear
   so quickly after initiation of rx)
   .
   # ESRD on PD:  Actually hypophosphotemic so will hold phosphate
   lowering meds.  Will continue qid dwells of 2L 2.5% dextrose solution.

   # Small cell lung cancer:  Metastatic and not currently undergoing any
   therapy.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2760**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung cancer who presented to the hospital with syncope and black stool. He was transferred to the ICU for further management. The patient has undergone several procedures, including an EGD and colonoscopy, and has received blood transfusions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, and blood pressure of 144/66 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hematocrit of 23.8%, and he has received a total of 5 units of blood transfusions. His white blood cell count is 9.0 K/uL, and his platelet count is 88 K/uL.

The patient's medical history includes ESRD on PD, small cell lung cancer, BPH, and a history of DVT/PE with an IVC filter. He is also taking medications for prophylaxis against DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's current medications include protonix, fluconazole, and nystatin. He is also receiving gentle IVFs and is NPO pending procedure.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and his disposition is likely to be discharged tomorrow after GI procedures.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of GIB and has received blood transfusions, which increases the risk of bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of candidal esophagitis and is receiving antibiotics, which increases the risk of infection.
3. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia and has received blood transfusions, which increases the risk of anemia.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of ESRD on PD and small cell lung cancer, which increases the risk of cardiovascular complications.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy and has a history of DVT/PE, which increases the risk of respiratory complications.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of GIB and is undergoing GI procedures, which increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and address potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung cancer
   who presented to OSH with syncope and black stool x 2 without clear
   source of bleed on EGD, now transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for enteroscopy and
   colonoscopy.
   .
   # GIB:  Given black stool, likely upper source.  As outlined above,
   initial EGD showed nonbleeding duodenal ulcer, but repeat scope showed
   duodenitis without evidence of ulceration.  Given GIB with HD
   instability (hypotensive, tachy, requiring 3 u prbcs), seems unlikely
   to be from sources visualized.  Thus, may likely be from small bowel
   AVM vs. ulceration distal to segments scoped.  Given no BRBPR, seems
   less likely lower source, but right sided colonic source is certainly
   possible.  Prepped already for [**Last Name (un) **] at [**Hospital3 1959**].  Currently HD
   stable.
   - GI procedures this afternoon
   - Maintain 2 PIVs
   - Monitor hematocrit following procedure
   - Protonix gtt although can likely transition to [**Hospital1 **] dosing
   .
   # Anemia:  Chronic anemia likely [**2-2**] to malignancy (baseline hct
   unknown), now with acute drop from blood loss.  Received 2 units during
   his [**Date range (1) 2759**] admission and then an additional 3 units since [**10-16**].
   Received 2 units overnight with appropriate increase in hematocrit.
   - management as above
   .
   # Candidal esophagitis:  Although none noted on repeat EGD, has
   received approximately 3 days of fluconazole and nystatin.  Patient
   without any symptoms of dysphagia or odynophagia.
   - will continue fluconazole and nystatin for now
   - address with GI duration of therapy (normally 14-21 days) given no
   signs of esophagitis on repeat scope just days after initial (? clear
   so quickly after initiation of rx)
   .
   # ESRD on PD:  Actually hypophosphotemic so will hold phosphate
   lowering meds.  Will continue qid dwells of 2L 2.5% dextrose solution.
   .
   # Small cell lung cancer:  Metastatic and not currently undergoing any
   therapy.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2760**].
   .
   # BPH: Produces small amount of urine.  Will hold on flomax pending
   continued stability in BP.
   .
   # h/o DVT/PE:  s/p IVC filter.  h/o HIT so prophylaxis with
   pneumoboots.
   .
   # FEN:  Clears until midnight and NPO thereafter pending procedure.
   Gentle IVFs.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung cancer, currently hospitalized for evaluation and management of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and enteroscopy/colonoscopy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 77 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 144/66 mmHg. He is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 100%.

The patient has a history of anemia, which is likely chronic due to his malignancy, and has received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) since admission. He is currently receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and will likely transition to a different dosing schedule once transferred to a different hospital.

The patient has a history of candidal esophagitis, which was treated with fluconazole and nystatin, and will continue to receive these medications for now.

He is also experiencing chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5, requiring hemodialysis (HD) three times a week, and has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), with an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter in place.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Hemorrhagic complications: Given the patient's history of GIB, there is a risk of further bleeding, particularly if the small bowel AVM or ulceration is not adequately treated.
2. Infection: The patient's history of candidal esophagitis and his current use of antibiotics and antifungal medications increases his risk of developing an infection, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
3. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's history of CKD and his ongoing HD therapy may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, particularly if his HD regimen is not adjusted accordingly.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's history of DVT and PE, as well as his current use of oxygen therapy, increases his risk of developing respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of hypertension and his current use of medications may increase his risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, or myocardial infarction.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to promptly address any potential complications and ensure optimal management of his condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He was transferred to the ICU for push enteroscopy and colonoscopy. Overnight, he was stable, and his hemoglobin level remained stable. He was transfused two units of packed red blood cells. His vital signs are stable, and he is hemodynamically stable. He is currently on a proton pump inhibitor drip for stress ulcer prophylaxis and fluconazole for fungal prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's GIB may worsen during the procedure, leading to further bleeding and potential hypovolemic shock.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to the procedure, leading to respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac status may worsen due to the procedure, leading to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status may deteriorate due to the procedure, leading to seizures, stroke, or other neurological complications.
5. Infection complications: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the invasive procedures and prolonged hospitalization.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient may develop gastrointestinal complications such as bowel obstruction, perforation, or abscesses due to the procedure.
7. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) complications: The patient is at risk of developing VTE due to immobility and the presence of central venous catheters.
8. Renal complications: The patient may develop acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypovolemia, nephrotoxic medications, or sepsis.
9. Metabolic complications: The patient may develop metabolic complications such as hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, or electrolyte imbalances due to the procedure and underlying disease."

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's current status:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with metastatic small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) who has been experiencing recurrent episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for a push enteroscopy and colonoscopy. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, with a stable hemoglobin count overnight. He received two units of packed red blood cells and is without complaint today.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.5°C (97.7°F)
* Heart rate: 80 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 145/76 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100% on nasal cannula

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* General appearance: No acute distress
* Cardiovascular: Normal heart sounds and rhythm
* Respiratory: Symmetric lung expansion and rhonchorous breath sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds present
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to stimuli

The patient's laboratory results include:

* Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 9.0 x 10^9/L
* Platelet count: 88 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 131 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Normal

The patient's plan includes:

* Endoscopy today to evaluate the source of GIB
* Monitoring of hemoglobin post-procedure
* If the patient remains hemodynamically stable and there is no significant bleeding, he may be considered for transfer to the floor

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Continued bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Respiratory failure due to aspiration or pneumonia
* Cardiovascular instability due to hypovolemia or cardiac arrhythmias
* Neurologic complications due to hypoxia or sepsis
* Infection or bleeding complications related to the central lines or other invasive devices."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with metastatic Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He was transferred from another hospital for push enteroscopy and colonoscopy. The patient has been hemodynamically stable overnight, with a stable hematocrit (HCT) level. He is currently receiving a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip for stress ulcer prophylaxis and has been transfused with two units of packed red blood cells (PRBC).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's recurrent GIB episodes may continue to pose a risk of bleeding, potentially leading to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's underlying SCLC and recurrent GIB may increase his risk of developing sepsis, particularly if he develops a secondary infection.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's lung cancer may lead to respiratory failure, potentially requiring mechanical ventilation.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate cardiovascular instability, potentially leading to cardiac arrest.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's laboratory results show mild electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, which may require close monitoring and potential treatment.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to his underlying cancer and recent transfusions may increase his risk of developing an infection, particularly if he develops a secondary infection.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase his risk of bleeding and require close monitoring and potential treatment.
8. Renal insufficiency: The patient's elevated creatinine level may indicate renal insufficiency, which may require close monitoring and potential treatment.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address his underlying medical conditions and potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a [age] year-old who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gaining strength back. The patient has undergone several procedures, including an EKG, endoscopy, and dialysis catheter placement. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, and blood pressure of 117/63 mmHg. The patient is receiving IV fluids and has a nasogastric tube in place. The patient's laboratory results show normal to mildly elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets. The patient's coagulation studies are normal, and the patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits. The patient's imaging studies show a cratered ulcer in the duodenal bulb with visible vessels.

Potential medical complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's endoscopy report shows a cratered ulcer in the duodenal bulb with visible vessels, which increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient's laboratory results show mildly elevated levels of white blood cells, which may indicate the presence of an infection.
3. Fluid overload: The patient is receiving IV fluids, which may increase the risk of fluid overload and subsequent complications such as pulmonary edema.
4. Thrombosis: The patient's laboratory results show mildly elevated levels of platelets, which may increase the risk of thrombosis.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's EKG shows sinus rhythm, but the patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications such as hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient is receiving oxygen therapy, which may increase the risk of respiratory complications such as respiratory failure.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's laboratory results show mildly elevated levels of white blood cells, which may increase the risk of neurological complications such as meningitis or encephalitis.

Based on the patient's laboratory results and imaging studies, the patient is at risk for several medical complications. The patient's healthcare providers should closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan as necessary to prevent or manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung cancer, who presented to the hospital with syncope and black stool. He underwent endoscopy and push enteroscopy, which revealed a bleeding ulcer in the duodenal bulb with visible vessel. The ulcer was successfully clamped, and the patient received 2 units of blood during his admission. He is currently receiving proton pump inhibitors and antifungal medications. He has a history of chronic anemia, ESRD on PD, and BPH.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Bleeding:** The patient's bleeding ulcer in the duodenal bulb is a significant risk factor for further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ dysfunction.
2. **Anemia:** The patient's chronic anemia, exacerbated by blood loss, may lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
3. **ESRD on PD:** The patient's hypophosphotemic status may lead to bone disease, muscle weakness, and increased risk of fractures.
4. **Candidal esophagitis:** Although the patient is receiving antifungal medications, there is a risk of relapse or development of resistance, which could lead to persistent esophagitis and its complications.
5. **Small cell lung cancer:** The patient's metastatic disease may progress, leading to further complications and decreased quality of life.
6. **DVT/PE:** The patient's history of DVT/PE and IVC filter may increase the risk of recurrent thromboembolic events, which could lead to pulmonary embolism and death.
7. **Infection:** The patient's compromised immune system and history of malignancy make him susceptible to infections, which could be life-threatening.
8. **Malnutrition:** The patient's NPO status and chronic anemia may lead to malnutrition, which could exacerbate his underlying medical conditions.

**Recommendations:**

1. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk factors and adjust his anticoagulation therapy accordingly.
2. Continue proton pump inhibitors and antifungal medications as prescribed.
3. Consider transfusing blood products to maintain the patient's hematocrit.
4. Monitor the patient's phosphate levels and adjust his phosphate-lowering medications as necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's small cell lung cancer with follow-up appointments with his oncologist.
6. Monitor the patient's DVT/PE risk factors and adjust his anticoagulation therapy accordingly.
7. Consider administering prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infections.
8. Ensure the patient receives adequate nutrition and consider consulting with a nutritionist to develop a personalized nutrition plan."

Summary:

The patient is a 76-year-old male with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and recurrent melena and hypotension. He was transferred from another hospital for push enteroscopy and colonoscopy. The patient has been experiencing bleeding from a duodenal ulcer and has been hemodynamically stable with stable hematocrit (Hct). He has been receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drip and has been monitored closely for signs of active gastrointestinal bleeding.

Assessment:

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 129/78 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. He has a sinus rhythm and is receiving no respiratory support.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.0, hemoglobin of 11.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 88. His creatinine is 1.6 mg/dL, and his glucose is 131 mg/dL.

Potential medical complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's duodenal ulcer is a significant risk factor for further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central lines and dialysis catheter increase his risk of developing infections, such as bacteremia, sepsis, and pneumonia.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he may be at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying lung disease and potential complications such as pneumonia or pleural effusion.
4. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but he may be at risk for cardiac arrest due to his underlying cardiac disease and potential complications such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he may be at risk for further renal failure due to his underlying kidney disease and potential complications such as acute tubular necrosis.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is unknown, and he may be at risk for developing neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, or encephalopathy due to his underlying disease and potential complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral edema."

   Assessment and Plan
   76 year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung cancer
   who presented to OSH with syncope and black stool x 2 without clear
   source of bleed on EGD, now transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for push enteroscopy.
   .
   # GIB:  Enteroscopy yesterday revealed bleeding ulcer in duodenal bulb
   with visible vessel, which was clamped successfully. HCT=29.4 last
   night, and 32.3 this morning. Patient is hemodynamically stable.
   - Advance diet as tolerated
   - Change to Protonix 40mg IV BID
   .
   # Anemia:  Chronic anemia likely [**2-2**] to malignancy (baseline hct
   unknown), now with acute drop from blood loss.  Received 2 units during
   his [**Date range (1) 2759**] admission and then an additional 3 units since [**10-16**].
   HCT improving this morning, recheck at 5pm.
   .
   # Candidal esophagitis:  Although none noted on repeat EGD, has
   received approximately 4 days of fluconazole and nystatin.  Patient
   without any symptoms of dysphagia or odynophagia.
   - Will discontinue fluconazole and nystatin as recent enteroscopy
   yesterday did not show evidence of candidal esophagitis.
   .
   # ESRD on PD:  Actually hypophosphotemic so will hold phosphate
   lowering meds. Continued improvement in phos. Currently on dwells of 2L
   2.5% dextrose solution. Will switch to home regimen of 4.25%.
   .
   # Small cell lung cancer:  Metastatic and not currently undergoing any
   therapy.  Followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2760**].
   .
   # BPH: Produces small amount of urine.  Flomax initially held for BP
   concerns. BP has been stable, thus this will be restarted at home dose
   of 0.4mg PO QHS.
   .
   # h/o DVT/PE:  s/p IVC filter.  h/o HIT so prophylaxis with
   pneumoboots.
   # FEN:  Advance diet as tolerated with no restrictions.  Gentle IVFs.
   # Access:  2 20G PIVs.
   # PPx:  Pneumoboots.
   # Code:  DNR/DNI, confirmed with patient.
   # Dispo:  Callout to medicine floor today.

Summary:

The patient, a 76-year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung cancer, is admitted to the ICU with a bleeding ulcer in the duodenal bulb with visible vessel, which was successfully clamped during push enteroscopy. He has received 5 units of blood and is hemodynamically stable. His hemoglobin has improved from 29.4 to 32.3. He has chronic anemia likely due to malignancy and acute anemia due to blood loss. He has been prescribed Protonix 40mg IV BID and will be advanced to a diet as tolerated.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's bleeding ulcer in the duodenal bulb is a potential complication that could lead to further bleeding, anemia, and even death.
2. Infection: The patient has received antibiotics and antifungals, but there is still a risk of infection, particularly given his immunocompromised state and recent endoscopy procedures.
3. Anemia: The patient's chronic anemia likely due to malignancy and acute anemia due to blood loss could lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and other symptoms.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's hypophosphatemia and potential electrolyte imbalances could lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and recent respiratory infections could lead to respiratory failure and other complications.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of DVT/PE and recent bleeding could lead to cardiovascular complications, including cardiac arrest.
7. Infection-related complications: The patient's immunocompromised state and recent endoscopy procedures could lead to infection-related complications, including sepsis and septic shock.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemoglobin and hemodynamic status closely.
2. Administer antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed to prevent infection.
3. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust medications as necessary to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and provide oxygen therapy as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely and provide cardiovascular support as necessary.
6. Consider placing the patient on prophylactic anticoagulation therapy to prevent further DVT/PE.
7. Consider transferring the patient to a step-down unit or a medical ward for further management."
