   Chief Complaint: Afib with RVR
   24 Hour Events:
   Patient given 20mg IV Lasix upon arrival to the floor as she was felt
   to have pulmonary edema secondary to volume overload in the setting of
   atrial fibrillation.  She urinated approximately 1200ml and her
   breathing improved.  She was transitioned from BiPap to facemask to
   nasal cannula.  She continues to cough intermittently, and has improved
   slightly with guaifenesin.
   She was rate-controlled with a diltiazem drip and metoprolol 50mg po
   qid.  She intially came with HR
s in the 120

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 7420**] M. [**Known lastname 7421**] is 71 year-old woman with pior history of
   [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease, DM, HTN, dyslipidemia admitted for atrial fib/flutter
   with RVR and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Paient with Afib/flutter with RVR. She is asymptomatic and
   has been maintaining her pressures. She failed 10 mg IV metoprolol x2,
   successfuly converted to sinus rhythm after cardioversion for a few
   seconds, but recurred.   Now she is rate-controlled with HR in the 60
   on diltiazem drip and metoprolol 50mg po qid.
   - Wean diltiazem drip as BP with MAPS in the 50
s this am
   - Increase Metoprolol 50 mg QID (double of home dose) to 75 mg
   metoprolol QID; discussed with endocrine non-selective beta-blocker and
   decided benefit would be minimal in short-term.
   - Continue Heparin gtt for anticoagulation
 likely transition to
   Coumadin for chronic anticoagulation
   - Patient less likely to benefit from cardioversion, and she was
   briefly in sinus rhythm yesterday and reverted back to Afib
   - ECHO today to r/o structural heart disease
   - If no CAD, consider sotalol, flecainide, or propefenone for
   anti-arrythmia as she may benefit from sinus rhythm
will consult EP
   today for their opinion
   - Continue heparin gtt pending EP recs of cardioversion possibility
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Patient with acute pulmonary edema in the
   setting of fluid overload in the ER and AFib with RVR.  Now with some
   residual coughing but on nasal cannula.
   - Diuresis prn with Lasix 20 mg IV for any recurrent SOB
   - Treat cough with prn ipratropium nebs and guiafenesin cough syrup prn
   - Rate control her as above
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF.
   .
   #. CAD - No known CAD, and no evidence that Afib is from ischemia.
   .
   # [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] Disease - Patient with [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease that stopped methimazole
   1 year ago. Her TSH has been progresively decreasing.  At this time her
   TSH is low, but with normal T3, free T4, and total t4.  Endocrine
   initially recommended methimazole due to low TSH, but felt that since
   her thyroid hormone levels were normal, thyroid disease likely did not
   precipitate her Afib.  She has been asymptomatic of any thyroid
   disease.
   - Appreciate endocrine recs
   - Metoprolol as above, will likely also treat thyroid disease if this
   is a precipitating factor
   .
   #. DM2 - Re-starting metformin at home-dose and will add ISS.
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt on dilt and metoprolol for now. Holding enalapril
   and HCTZ.
   .
   #. Smoking - Doing nicotine patch and social work.
   .
   #. Dyslipidemia - Continuing home-dose statin.
   .
   #. OA - Stable.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health status and potential medical complications:

The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease. She was admitted to the ICU with acute pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid overload and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She was given IV Lasix and transitioned from BiPap to nasal cannula. Her heart rate was initially in the 120s-130s but has been rate-controlled with diltiazem drip and metoprolol 50mg po qid, resulting in a heart rate of 60s.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, blood pressure of 94/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She has a normal sinus rhythm and is asymptomatic.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter and is currently in a sinus rhythm. There is a risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation/flutter, which could lead to further complications such as cardiac arrest or stroke.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute pulmonary edema and is at risk of developing further respiratory failure if her fluid overload is not managed properly.
3. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to her atrial fibrillation and immobility.
4. Thyroid disease: The patient has a history of [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease and is currently being treated with methimazole. There is a risk of thyroid storm or hypothyroidism if her thyroid hormone levels are not properly managed.
5. Diabetes: The patient has diabetes and is at risk of developing hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia if her blood glucose levels are not properly managed.
6. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension and is at risk of developing further complications such as cardiac failure or stroke if her blood pressure is not properly managed.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Rate control with diltiazem drip and metoprolol 50mg po qid.
2. Diuresis with Lasix 20mg IV as needed for recurrent shortness of breath.
3. Treatment of cough with ipratropium nebs and guaifenesin cough syrup as needed.
4. Monitoring of blood glucose levels and treatment of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia as needed.
5. Monitoring of blood pressure and treatment of hypertension as needed.
6. Consultation with the endocrine team to determine the best course of treatment for the patient's thyroid disease.
7. ECHO to rule out structural heart disease and to assess the anatomic substrate of atrial arrhythmia.
8. Consideration of anti-arrhythmic medications such as sotalol, flecainide, or propafenone if the patient does not benefit from cardioversion."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient, a 71-year-old woman, was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and respiratory distress. She was given 20mg IV Lasix upon arrival to the floor, which resulted in improved breathing and urination of approximately 1200ml. Her heart rate was initially in the 120-130 beats per minute (bpm) range, but has since been rate-controlled with a diltiazem drip and metoprolol 50mg po qid, resulting in a heart rate in the 60s bpm range.

The patient is currently on nasal cannula oxygen therapy and is being treated for acute pulmonary edema in the setting of fluid overload and atrial fibrillation with RVR. She is also being treated for cough with guaifenesin and ipratropium nebs as needed.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.8°C (98.2°F)
* Heart rate: 72 bpm
* Blood pressure: 94/51 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%

The patient's physical examination is notable for bibasilar crackles in the lungs, a normal jugular venous pressure (JVP), and a normal cardiac examination.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Recurrent atrial fibrillation
* Respiratory failure
* Pulmonary edema
* Hypotension
* Cerebral edema
* Myocardial infarction
* Stroke
* Cardiac arrhythmias
* Thyroid storm
* Respiratory distress

The patient's laboratory results and radiology reports are pending. The patient's code status is full code, and she is planned to be transferred to the hospital ward on the third day."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 7420**] M. [**Known lastname 7421**] is 71 year-old woman with pior history of
   [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease, DM, HTN, dyslipidemia admitted for atrial fib/flutter
   with RVR and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Paient with Afib/flutter with RVR. She is asymptomatic and
   has been maintaining her pressures. She failed 10 mg IV metoprolol x2,
   successfuly converted to sinus rhythm after cardioversion for a few
   seconds, but recurred.   Now she is rate-controlled with HR in the 60
   on diltiazem drip and metoprolol 50mg po qid.
   - Wean diltiazem drip as BP with MAPS in the 50
s this am
   - Increase Metoprolol 50 mg QID (double of home dose) to 75 mg
   metoprolol QID; discussed with endocrine non-selective beta-blocker and
   decided benefit would be minimal in short-term.
   - Continue Heparin gtt for anticoagulation
 likely transition to
   Coumadin for chronic anticoagulation
   - Patient less likely to benefit from cardioversion, and she was
   briefly in sinus rhythm yesterday and reverted back to Afib
   - ECHO today to r/o structural heart disease
   - If no CAD, consider sotalol, flecainide, or propefenone for
   anti-arrythmia as she may benefit from sinus rhythm
will consult EP
   today for their opinion
   - Continue heparin gtt pending EP recs of cardioversion possibility
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Patient with acute pulmonary edema in the
   setting of fluid overload in the ER and AFib with RVR.  Now with some
   residual coughing but on nasal cannula.
   - Diuresis prn with Lasix 20 mg IV for any recurrent SOB
   - Treat cough with prn ipratropium nebs and guiafenesin cough syrup prn
   - Rate control her as above
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF.
   .
   #. CAD - No known CAD, and no evidence that Afib is from ischemia.
   .
   # [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] Disease - Patient with [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease that stopped methimazole
   1 year ago. Her TSH has been progresively decreasing.  At this time her
   TSH is low, but with normal T3, free T4, and total t4.  Endocrine
   initially recommended methimazole due to low TSH, but felt that since
   her thyroid hormone levels were normal, thyroid disease likely did not
   precipitate her Afib.  She has been asymptomatic of any thyroid
   disease.
   - Appreciate endocrine recs
   - Metoprolol as above, will likely also treat thyroid disease if this
   is a precipitating factor
   .
   #. DM2 - Re-starting metformin at home-dose and will add ISS.
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt on dilt and metoprolol for now. Holding enalapril
   and HCTZ.
   .
   #. Smoking - Doing nicotine patch and social work.
   .
   #. Dyslipidemia - Continuing home-dose statin.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. She was admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and respiratory distress.

The patient received 20mg IV Lasix upon arrival to the floor, which resulted in improved breathing and urination of approximately 1200ml. She was transitioned from BiPap to facemask to nasal cannula and continues to cough intermittently, but with improved symptoms after treatment with guaifenesin.

The patient's rhythm is now controlled with a diltiazem drip and metoprolol 50mg po qid, with a heart rate in the 60s. Her blood pressure is 81/51, and she feels slightly dizzy when sitting up.

The patient has a history of thyroid disease, which was stopped one year ago. Her TSH has been progressively decreasing, but her thyroid hormone levels are normal. Endocrine recommended methimazole due to low TSH, but felt that since her thyroid hormone levels are normal, thyroid disease likely did not precipitate her atrial fibrillation.

The patient is also being treated for diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and OA.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: Atrial fibrillation can lead to stroke, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory complications: Pulmonary edema can lead to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Thyroid complications: Untreated hypothyroidism can lead to complications such as myxedema coma, which can be life-threatening.
4. Diabetes complications: Untreated diabetes can lead to complications such as ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome, and nephropathy.
5. Hypertension complications: Untreated hypertension can lead to complications such as stroke, heart failure, and kidney disease.
6. Dyslipidemia complications: Untreated dyslipidemia can lead to complications such as atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and peripheral artery disease.
7. OA complications: Untreated OA can lead to complications such as joint damage, disability, and reduced quality of life.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Weaning the diltiazem drip as her blood pressure improves.
2. Increasing metoprolol to 75mg po qid to control her heart rate.
3. Continuing heparin drip for anticoagulation and considering transition to Coumadin for chronic anticoagulation.
4. Echocardiogram to rule out structural heart disease.
5. Consultation with EP for opinion on cardioversion possibility.
6. Diuresis prn with Lasix 20mg IV for recurrent SOB.
7. Treatment of cough with ipratropium nebs and guaifenesin cough syrup prn.
8. Monitoring for signs of CHF.
9. Re-starting metformin at home-dose and adding ISS for diabetes management.
10. Continuing home-dose statin for dyslipidemia management.
11. Holding enalapril and HCTZ for hypertension management.
12. Continuing nicotine patch and social work for smoking cessation.
13. Continuing home-dose statin for OA management."

If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Wean Dilt: stopped at 1100
   - Metoprolol changed to 75mg QID, peak flow before and after beta
   blocker was unchanged at 250; done due to concern for bronchospasm and
   BB.
   - Added Diltiazem 30 mg po QID for better rate control at [**2095**]
   - ECHO: LVEF > 55%; 2+ MR, mild PA hypertension (TA gradient 27 mm Hg)
   - EP Recs: [**Doctor First Name **] will see later for offical antiarrythmic medication;
   Continue Heparin gtt; continue rate control; can cardiovert in
   outpatient, or if still inpatient by monday, can do inpatient on
   Monday.
   - Endo recs: Differential: subclinical thyrotoxicosis or TSH artifact
   due to nonthyroidal illness (ie sick euthyroid). Start low dose
   methimazole and plan on having repeat TFTs in [**12-30**] weeks. Be careful of
   agranulocytosis!!

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 7420**] M. [**Known lastname 7421**] is 71 year-old woman with pior history of
   [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease, DM, HTN, dyslipidemia admitted for atrial fib/flutter
   with RVR and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Paient with Afib/flutter with RVR. She is asymptomatic and
   has been maintaining her pressures. She failed 10 mg IV metoprolol x2,
   successfuly converted to sinus rhythm after cardioversion for a few
   seconds, but recurred.   Now she is rate-controlled with HR in the 60
   on diltiazem drip and metoprolol 50mg po qid.
   - Wean diltiazem drip as BP with MAPS in the 50
s this am
   - Increase Metoprolol 50 mg QID (double of home dose) to 75 mg
   metoprolol QID; discussed with endocrine non-selective beta-blocker and
   decided benefit would be minimal in short-term.
   - Continue Heparin gtt for anticoagulation
 likely transition to
   Coumadin for chronic anticoagulation
   - Patient less likely to benefit from cardioversion, and she was
   briefly in sinus rhythm yesterday and reverted back to Afib
   - ECHO today to r/o structural heart disease
   - If no CAD, consider sotalol, flecainide, or propefenone for
   anti-arrythmia as she may benefit from sinus rhythm
will consult EP
   today for their opinion
   - Continue heparin gtt pending EP recs of cardioversion possibility
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Patient with acute pulmonary edema in the
   setting of fluid overload in the ER and AFib with RVR.  Now with some
   residual coughing but on nasal cannula.
   - Diuresis prn with Lasix 20 mg IV for any recurrent SOB
   - Treat cough with prn ipratropium nebs and guiafenesin cough syrup prn
   - Rate control her as above
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF.
   .
   #. CAD - No known CAD, and no evidence that Afib is from ischemia.
   .
   # [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] Disease
 Concern for subclinical thyrotoxicosis or TSH
   artifact due to nonthyroidal illness (ie sick euthyroid). Endocrine
   recommends starting methimazole
   - Follow up endocrine recs.
   - Metoprolol as above, will likely also treat thyroid disease if this
   is a precipitating factor
   .
   #. DM2 - Re-starting metformin at home-dose and will add ISS.
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt on dilt and metoprolol for now. Holding enalapril
   and HCTZ.
   .
   #. Smoking - Doing nicotine patch and social work.
   .
   #. Dyslipidemia - Continuing home-dose statin.
   .
   #. OA - Stable.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type II, pulmonary edema, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's condition has been stable, with no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory results.

The patient's medications have been adjusted to include metoprolol 75mg QID, diltiazem 30mg po QID, warfarin 5mg daily, and low-dose methimazole for subclinical thyrotoxicosis or TSH artifact due to nonthyroidal illness. The patient is also receiving heparin infusion and will have an INR check on Sunday.

The patient's laboratory results show stable kidney function, with a creatinine level of 1.2mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 22mg/dL. The patient's glucose level has been stable, with a range of 192-370mg/dL. The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 36.0% to 32.7%, which may indicate blood loss or anemia.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the lack of assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Bronchospasm: The patient's beta blocker was changed due to concern for bronchospasm, which may indicate a risk of respiratory compromise.
2. Bleeding: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is slightly elevated at 1.1, which may indicate a risk of bleeding.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has decreased from 234 to 192, which may indicate a risk of bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count has decreased from 9.8 to 7.4, which may indicate a risk of infection.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation may be a risk factor for cardiac arrhythmias, which may worsen the patient's condition.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's glucose level has been stable, but the patient may be at risk of hypoglycemia due to the use of insulin and other medications.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may be a risk factor for bleeding complications.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary edema may be a risk factor for respiratory failure.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Adjust the patient's medications as needed to manage the patient's condition.
3. Consider the patient's risk factors for bleeding and take precautions to minimize the risk of bleeding.
4. Monitor the patient's glucose level closely and adjust the patient's insulin regimen as needed.
5. Consider the patient's risk factors for respiratory failure and take precautions to minimize the risk of respiratory failure.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and take precautions to minimize the risk of bleeding complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 7420**] M. [**Known lastname 7421**] is 71 year-old woman with pior history of
   [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease, DM, HTN, dyslipidemia admitted for atrial fib/flutter
   with RVR and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Paient with Afib/flutter with RVR. She is asymptomatic and
   has been maintaining her pressures. She failed 10 mg IV metoprolol x2,
   successfuly converted to sinus rhythm after cardioversion for a few
   seconds, but recurred.   Now she is modestly rate-controlled with HR in
   the 80-115s; currently on metoprolol 75 mg po qid and dilt po 30 mg tid
   - At this point, subclinical hyperthyroid is high on differential; Will
   increase methimazole to 10 mg daily
   - Increase Metoprolol 75 mg QID (double of home dose) to 100 mg
   metoprolol QID; discussed with endocrine non-selective beta-blocker and
   decided benefit would be minimal in short-term.
   - Continue Heparin gtt for anticoagulation
 Started Coumadin for
   chronic anticoagulation; will check INR tomorrow
   - ECHO r/o structural heart disease
   - EP following, appreciate recs; will consider cardioversion at some
   point if patient does not convert to sinus and thyroid function
   stabilizes
   - Continue heparin gtt pending EP recs of cardioversion possibility
   - Endo following
appreciate recs
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Patient with acute pulmonary edema in the
   setting of fluid overload in the ER and AFib with RVR.  Now with some
   residual coughing but on nasal cannula.
   - Diuresis prn with Lasix 20 mg IV for any recurrent SOB
   - Treat cough with prn ipratropium nebs and guiafenesin cough syrup prn
   - Rate control her as above
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of CHF.
   .
   #. CAD - No known CAD, and no evidence that Afib is from ischemia.
   .
   # [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] Disease
 Concern for subclinical thyrotoxicosis or TSH
   artifact due to nonthyroidal illness (ie sick euthyroid). Endocrine
   recommends starting methimazole
   - Endocrine recs appreciated
   - Metoprolol as above
   -methimazole 10 mg daily, will follow daily cbc
s to monitor for
   agranulocytosis.
   .
   #. DM2 - Re-starting metformin at home-dose and will add ISS.
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt on dilt and metoprolol for now. Holding enalapril
   and HCTZ.
   .
   #. Smoking - Doing nicotine patch and social work.
   .
   #. Dyslipidemia - Continuing home-dose statin.
   .
   #. OA - Stable.

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: I believe that she has longstanding
   low grade thyrotoxicosis notwithstanding her nominally normal thyroid
   hormone levels.  Therefore we will treat her for thyrotoxicosis
   (methimazole) and uptitrate her beta blocker.  I anticipate spontaneous
   conversion to sinus rhythm after this therapy is implemented.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Last Name (STitle) 7420**] M. [**Known lastname 7421**] is 71 year-old woman with pior history of
   [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease, DM, HTN, dyslipidemia admitted for atrial fib/flutter
   with RVR and respiratory distress.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Paient with Afib/flutter with RVR. She is asymptomatic and
   has been maintaining her pressures. She failed 10 mg IV metoprolol x2,
   successfuly converted to sinus rhythm after cardioversion for a few
   seconds, but recurred.   Now she is modestly rate-controlled with HR in
   the 80-115s; currently on metoprolol 75 mg po qid and dilt po 30 mg tid
   - At this point, subclinical hyperthyroid is high on differential; Will
   increase methimazole to 10 mg daily
   - Increase Metoprolol 75 mg QID (double of home dose) to 100 mg
   metoprolol QID; discussed with endocrine non-selective beta-blocker and
   decided benefit would be minimal in short-term.
   - Continue Heparin gtt for anticoagulation
 Started Coumadin for
   chronic anticoagulation; will check INR tomorrow
   - ECHO r/o structural heart disease
   - EP following, appreciate recs; will consider cardioversion at some
   point if patient does not convert to sinus and thyroid function
   stabilizes
   - Continue heparin gtt pending EP recs of cardioversion possibility
   - Endo following
appreciate recs
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure - Patient with acute pulmonary edema in the
   setting of fluid overload in the ER and AFib with RVR.  Now with some
   residual coughing but on nasal cannula.
   - Diuresis prn with Lasix 20 mg IV for any recurrent SOB
   - Treat cough with prn ipratropium nebs and guiafenesin cough syrup prn
   - Rate control her as above

 Concern for subclinical thyrotoxicosis or TSH
   artifact due to nonthyroidal illness (ie sick euthyroid). Endocrine
   recommends starting methimazole
   - Endocrine recs appreciated
   - Metoprolol as above
   -methimazole 10 mg daily, will follow daily cbc
s to monitor for
   agranulocytosis.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: I believe that she has longstanding
   low grade thyrotoxicosis notwithstanding her nominally normal thyroid
   hormone levels.  Therefore we will treat her for thyrotoxicosis
   (methimazole) and uptitrate her beta blocker.  I anticipate spontaneous
   conversion to sinus rhythm after this therapy is implemented.
   Above discussed extensively with patient.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease.

The patient's current medications include metoprolol 75 mg po qid, diltiazem 30 mg po tid, and warfarin 5 mg daily. She is also receiving heparin drip for anticoagulation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 111/66 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Her respiratory status is improving, with a respiratory rate of 27 inspirations per minute.

The patient's physical examination is notable for bibasilar crackles on lung examination, and her cardiac examination reveals a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 80-115 bpm. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and her extremities have 2+ peripheral pulses.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, and platelet count of 234 K/uL. Her electrolyte panel shows a sodium level of 139 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.7 mEq/L, and chloride level of 107 mEq/L.

The patient's ECHO shows normal global and regional biventricular systolic function, moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's plan includes continuing metoprolol and diltiazem, increasing methimazole to 10 mg daily, and starting coumadin for chronic anticoagulation. She will also undergo EP follow-up and consideration for cardioversion if her rhythm does not convert to sinus and her thyroid function stabilizes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, decreased cardiac output, and increased risk of stroke.
2. Respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
3. Cardiac failure, which can lead to decreased cardiac output, increased risk of arrhythmias, and decreased renal function.
4. Thyrotoxicosis, which can lead to increased metabolic rate, weight loss, and decreased thyroid function.
5. Agranulocytosis, which can lead to decreased white blood cell count and increased risk of infection.
6. Bleeding complications, which can arise from the use of anticoagulation medications.
7. Kidney damage, which can arise from decreased cardiac output, increased blood pressure, and decreased renal perfusion.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, and her medications and treatment plan are aimed at managing her atrial fibrillation, respiratory distress, and thyroid function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   24 Hour Events:
   - Wean Dilt: stopped at 1100
   - Metoprolol changed to 75mg QID, peak flow before and after beta
   blocker was unchanged at 250; done due to concern for bronchospasm and
   BB.
   - Added Diltiazem 30 mg po QID for better rate control at [**2095**]
   - ECHO: LVEF > 55%; 2+ MR, mild PA hypertension (TA gradient 27 mm Hg)
   - EP Recs: [**Doctor First Name **] will see later for offical antiarrythmic medication;
   Continue Heparin gtt; continue rate control; can cardiovert in
   outpatient, or if still inpatient by monday, can do inpatient on
   Monday.
   - Endo recs: Differential: subclinical thyrotoxicosis or TSH artifact
   due to nonthyroidal illness (ie sick euthyroid). Start low dose
   methimazole and plan on having repeat TFTs in [**12-30**] weeks. Be careful of

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old woman admitted for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and respiratory distress. She has a history of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease. She was initially treated with metoprolol and diltiazem, but due to concerns about bronchospasm and beta-blocker, the dose of metoprolol was reduced and diltiazem was added. She was also started on warfarin and methimazole for suspected subclinical thyrotoxicosis. The patient's condition is being monitored, and she is currently receiving cardiac and respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's atrial fibrillation is not well-controlled, and the rapid ventricular response may lead to hemodynamic instability and worsen her respiratory distress.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient has acute pulmonary edema, which may worsen her respiratory distress and increase her risk of cardiac complications.
3. Subclinical thyrotoxicosis: The patient's suspected subclinical thyrotoxicosis may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, and other complications if left untreated.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen her condition and increase her risk of cardiac complications.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and pulmonary edema may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and arrhythmias.
7. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state may increase her risk of infection, particularly pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis.
8. Agranulocytosis: The patient's use of methimazole may increase her risk of agranulocytosis, a life-threatening complication.
9. Thromboembolic events: The patient's use of anticoagulants may increase her risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's atrial fibrillation and adjust her medication as needed to control her symptoms.
2. Monitor the patient's pulmonary edema and adjust her diuretic therapy as needed to prevent worsening of her condition.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's subclinical thyrotoxicosis and adjust her medication as needed to control her symptoms.
4. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding risk and adjust her anticoagulant therapy as needed to minimize this risk.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory failure and adjust her respiratory support as needed to prevent worsening of her condition.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular complications and adjust her medication as needed to prevent worsening of her condition.
7. Monitor the patient's infection risk and adjust her antibiotic therapy as needed to prevent and treat infections.
8. Monitor the patient's agranulocytosis risk and adjust her medication as needed to minimize this risk.
9. Monitor the patient's thromboembolic events risk and adjust her anticoagulant therapy as needed to minimize this risk."

   #. Rhythm - Paient with Afib/flutter with RVR. She is asymptomatic and
   has been maintaining her pressures. She failed 10 mg IV metoprolol x2,
   successfuly converted to sinus rhythm after cardioversion for a few
   seconds, but recurred.   Now she is modestly rate-controlled with HR in
   the 80-115s; currently on metoprolol 100 mg po qid.
   - Have increased methimazole to 10mg daily as subclinical hyperthyroid
   is high on differential
   - Continue Metoprolol 100mg QID; discussed with endocrine non-selective
   beta-blocker and decided benefit would be minimal in short-term
   - Continue Heparin gtt for anticoagulation; have started Coumadin for
   chronic anticoagulation (INR 1.6 today); consider lovenox teaching and
   bridge to therapeutic INR if patient stabilizes enough to be d/c
   - EP following, appreciate recs; will consider cardioversion at some
   point if patient does not convert to sinus and thyroid function
   stabilizes.  Patient does not want cardioversion at this time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and respiratory distress. She has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and thyroid disease. The patient's rhythm is currently in sinus rhythm, but she has had episodes of atrial fibrillation with RVR. She is being treated with metoprolol, methimazole, and heparin, and is being monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiovascular: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR is a potential risk factor for stroke, and she is at increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.
2. Respiratory: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but she may still be at risk for respiratory failure and pneumonia.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and increased white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection, and she is at risk for sepsis and septic shock.
4. Thyroid-related complications: The patient's subclinical hyperthyroidism and potential for agranulocytosis from methimazole therapy are potential complications.
5. Hematological: The patient's increased white blood cell count and potential for agranulocytosis from methimazole therapy are potential complications.
6. Endocrine: The patient's subclinical hyperthyroidism and potential for thyroid-related complications are potential complications.
7. Neurological: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR may increase her risk for stroke and transient ischemic attacks.
8. Gastrointestinal: The patient's potential for gastrointestinal bleeding and constipation from medication therapy are potential complications.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to monitor her closely for potential complications and adjust her treatment plan as needed to prevent and manage these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and doctor's disease. She was initially treated with metoprolol, diltiazem, and methimazole, but diltiazem was discontinued due to the patient's asymptomatic atrial fibrillation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 118-125 beats per minute, blood pressure of 97/63-126/90 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 92% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals an enlarged thyroid gland, but no other significant abnormalities. Her laboratory results show an increase in white blood cell count to 20.7 with 88.4% neutrophils, which may be related to the administration of IV solumedrol.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Rate control: Metoprolol 100mg QID, with a plan to switch to long-acting metoprolol tomorrow.
2. Thyroid function monitoring: Methimazole 10mg daily, with daily CBC monitoring for agranulocytosis.
3. Cardioversion: The patient does not want cardioversion at this time, but it may be considered if the patient does not convert to sinus rhythm and thyroid function stabilizes.
4. Respiratory support: Diuresis with Lasix 20mg IV as needed for recurrent shortness of breath.
5. Leukocytosis: Monitor daily CBC and follow up on cultures.
6. CAD: No known CAD, and no evidence that atrial fibrillation is related to ischemia.
7. DM2: Start metformin 1000mg daily and ISS.
8. Hypertension: Restart enalapril and hold HCTZ.
9. Smoking: Nicotine patch and social work.
10. Dyslipidemia: Continue home-dose statin.
11. OA: Stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Atrial fibrillation with RVR: The patient's heart rate remains elevated, and there is a risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of acute pulmonary edema, and there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and there is a risk of developing infections.
4. Thyroid function abnormalities: The patient has a history of doctor's disease, and there is a risk of developing subclinical thyrotoxicosis or TSH artifact due to nonthyroidal illness.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, which increases the risk of cardiovascular complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications and ensure optimal care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old woman admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and respiratory distress. She has a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease. She was started on metoprolol 100mg QID for rate control and methimazole 10mg daily for subclinical hyperthyroidism. She was also started on enalapril 5mg daily for hypertension. Her white blood cell count increased to 20.7, which may be related to IV solumedrol received in the ED. Her respiratory status has improved, and she is being treated with diuresis and bronchodilators as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen if her rate control medication is not effective or if she experiences stress or anxiety.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if she experiences further fluid overload or if her bronchospasm worsens.
3. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection. She may be at risk for developing sepsis or septic shock if her infection is not properly treated.
4. Thyroid storm: The patient's subclinical hyperthyroidism may worsen if her methimazole medication is not effective or if she experiences stress or anxiety.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient may be at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, if her atrial fibrillation is not properly managed.
6. Pulmonary edema: The patient may experience further fluid overload and develop pulmonary edema if her diuresis is not effective or if she experiences further respiratory distress.
7. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may worsen if her underlying infection is not properly treated or if she experiences further stress or anxiety.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient may be at risk for developing gastrointestinal bleeding if she experiences further stress or anxiety or if her medication regimen is not properly managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue rate control medication: The patient's rate control medication should be continued to manage her atrial fibrillation.
2. Monitor for signs of infection: The patient's white blood cell count should be monitored for signs of infection, and she should be treated promptly if infection is suspected.
3. Manage respiratory status: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and she should be treated promptly if she experiences further respiratory distress.
4. Monitor for signs of thyroid storm: The patient's subclinical hyperthyroidism should be closely monitored for signs of thyroid storm, and she should be treated promptly if thyroid storm is suspected.
5. Manage cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac arrhythmias should be closely monitored, and she should be treated promptly if arrhythmias are suspected.
6. Monitor for signs of pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema should be closely monitored, and she should be treated promptly if pulmonary edema is suspected.
7. Monitor for signs of leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis should be closely monitored, and she should be treated promptly if leukocytosis worsens.
8. Manage gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding should be closely monitored, and she should be treated promptly if bleeding is suspected."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 71-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and [**Doctor Last Name 3479**] disease. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and acute pulmonary edema.

Current medications include metoprolol 100mg QID, methimazole 10mg daily, enalapril 5mg daily, and heparin drip.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 118-125 bpm, blood pressure of 97/63-126/90 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 92%. Her white blood cell count has increased to 20.7, but has since decreased to 11.6.

The patient has undergone cardioversion, but has remained in AFib. She is being monitored for subclinical hyperthyroidism and is receiving methimazole. She is also being treated for respiratory failure with diuresis and bronchodilators.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's AFib with RVR may persist or worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial flutter or ventricular tachycardia.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute pulmonary edema may recur, leading to respiratory failure.
3. Infection: The patient's increased white blood cell count and decreased oxygen saturation may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen her respiratory status.
4. Thyroid-related complications: The patient's subclinical hyperthyroidism may lead to thyroid-related complications such as thyrotoxic crisis or thyroid storm.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy with heparin and Coumadin may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's use of diuretics and bronchodilators may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
7. Renal complications: The patient's acute pulmonary edema and fluid overload may lead to renal complications such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 71-year-old woman, is admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and respiratory distress. She has a history of hyperthyroidism, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. She was started on metoprolol 100mg QID, methimazole 10mg daily, and enalapril 5mg daily. Her white blood cell count increased to 20.7, but has since decreased to 11.6. She received IV solumedrol in the ED and is being monitored for infection. The patient is asymptomatic and has been maintaining her pressures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiovascular:
	* AFib with RVR may lead to decreased cardiac output, increased risk of stroke, and cardiac arrhythmias.
	* Metoprolol may not be effective in controlling the heart rate, leading to increased risk of cardiac complications.
2. Respiratory:
	* Acute pulmonary edema may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and increased risk of mortality.
	* Fluid overload may lead to increased risk of respiratory complications.
3. Infectious:
	* Leukocytosis may be a sign of underlying infection, which may not be apparent due to the patient's asymptomatic status.
	* The patient is at risk for developing sepsis, which may worsen her condition.
4. Endocrine:
	* Subclinical hyperthyroidism may worsen, leading to increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias, osteoporosis, and other complications.
