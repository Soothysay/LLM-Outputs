 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FALL(S)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  Head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was violently
   thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With gentle fluids
   and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's history was
   obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite frequently.  She
   is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope work-ups have been
   unrevealing to date.
   .
   Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - blood cx is spikes
   - no antibiotics for now in absence of signs of infection
   - decrease sedation and extubate in am
   - check B12, Thiamine and Folate, then replete
   - f/u urine cx
   - if agitated once extubated, consider Haldol only as needed
   - clear c-spine once awake and extubated, with a negative CT scan, low
   risk for ligamentous injury given mechanism of fall
   .
   Syncope/Fall - Per report, pt lost consciousness before she fell.  Per
   son and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of
   consciousness.  Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension,
   MI, or other neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive
   work-up at [**Hospital3 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood
   glucose 156 in field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not
   available in [**Hospital3 140**] records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG,
   cardiac enzymes negative x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to
   facilitate beta 2-receptor blockade and assist with some possible
   neurogenic causes of her symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink
   anything but coffee that he is aware of and is often light-headed when
   she stands up.  BBlocker and/or CCB could be contributing to
   hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia
   - Check B12, Thimaine and Folate, then replete
   - ROMI, cardiac enzymes negative x1
   - consider carotid dopplers
   - continue gently volume resuscitation
   - hold BBlocker and calcium channel blocker for now
   - XRs negative
   .
   Resp Failure
 Intubated in setting of altered MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] acute pulmonary
   issues. On minimal settings.
   - Plan to extubate this AM if following commands off sedation
   .
   Elevated Lactate - Differential includes infection versus muscle
   exertion in setting of extreme agitation and combativeness.  Likely due
   to the latter.  With time and gentle fluids acidemia and elevated
   lactate have resolved.
   - normalized lactate by AM
   .
   Elevated troponin
 Trop is still in indeterminate range but has
   trended up from <0.01 to 0.04 this AM. CK also trending up but MD flat.
   - Repeat EKG
   - Cycle enzymes until trajectory is evident
   - Fluids for CKs
   .
   Hypertension - on HCTZ and amlodipine
   - will hold for now
   .
   Hyperlipidemia - on lescol at home
   - will restart when extubated
   .
   FEN - NPO, gentle fluids, replete lytes, replete B12, thiamine and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information is summarized:

* The patient is an 89-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and syncope, who was brought to the emergency department after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.
* She was intubated in the ED for altered mental status, and a head CT was negative for acute bleed.
* The patient's labs were mostly unremarkable, except for a mildly elevated lactate and acidemia, which was attributed to her violent thrashing before sedation and intubation.
* The patient's history was obtained from her son, who reports that she falls frequently and is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].
* The patient has altered mental status, which could be due to trauma from the fall, toxic metabolic, infection, or delirium.
* She has impaired skin integrity and is at risk for further skin breakdown.
* The patient has a history of syncope, which has been unrevealing to date, and has been treated with beta blockers and calcium channel blockers.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on minimal settings, and plans are to extubate her in the morning if she follows commands off sedation.
2. Infection: The patient has a mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, and there is a risk of occult infection.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and syncope, which puts her at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and stroke.
4. Neurological complications: The patient has altered mental status, which could be due to trauma from the fall, toxic metabolic, infection, or delirium.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient has impaired skin integrity and is at risk for further skin breakdown.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is NPO, and there is a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism due to her immobility and age.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Decrease sedation and extubate in the morning
* Check B12, Thiamine, and Folate, then replete
* F/u urine CX
* If agitated once extubated, consider Haldol only as needed
* Clear C-spine once awake and extubated, with a negative CT scan, low risk for ligamentous injury given mechanism of fall
* Continue gentle volume resuscitation
* Hold beta blockers and calcium channel blockers for now
* XRs negative
* Repeat EKG
* Cycle enzymes until trajectory is evident
* Fluids for CKs"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FALL(S)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  Head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was violently
   thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With gentle fluids
   and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's history was
   obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite frequently.  She
   is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope work-ups have been
   unrevealing to date.
   .
   Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - blood cx is spikes
   - no antibiotics for now in absence of signs of infection
   - decrease sedation and extubate in am
   - check B12, Thiamine and Folate, then replete
   - f/u urine cx
   - if agitated once extubated, consider Haldol only as needed
   - clear c-spine once awake and extubated, with a negative CT scan, low
   risk for ligamentous injury given mechanism of fall
   .
   Syncope/Fall - Per report, pt lost consciousness before she fell.  Per
   son and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of
   consciousness.  Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension,
   MI, or other neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive
   work-up at [**Hospital3 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood
   glucose 156 in field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not
   available in [**Hospital3 140**] records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG,
   cardiac enzymes negative x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to
   facilitate beta 2-receptor blockade and assist with some possible
   neurogenic causes of her symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink
   anything but coffee that he is aware of and is often light-headed when
   she stands up.  BBlocker and/or CCB could be contributing to
   hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia
   - Check B12, Thimaine and Folate, then replete
   - ROMI, cardiac enzymes negative x1
   - consider carotid dopplers
   - continue gently volume resuscitation
   - hold BBlocker and calcium channel blocker for now
   - XRs negative
   .
   Resp Failure
 Intubated in setting of altered MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] acute pulmonary
   issues. On minimal settings.
   - Plan to extubate this AM if following commands off sedation
   .
   Elevated Lactate - Differential includes infection versus muscle
   exertion in setting of extreme agitation and combativeness.  Likely due
   to the latter.  With time and gentle fluids acidemia and elevated
   lactate have resolved.
   - normalized lactate by AM
   .
   Elevated troponin
 Trop is still in indeterminate range but has
   trended up from <0.01 to 0.04 this AM. CK also trending up but MD flat.
   - Repeat EKG
   - Cycle enzymes until trajectory is evident
   - Fluids for CKs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With gentle fluids
   and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's history was
   obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite frequently.  She
   is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope work-ups have been
   unrevealing to date.
   .
   Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - blood cx is spikes
   - no antibiotics for now in absence of signs of infection
   - decrease sedation and extubate in am
   - check B12, Thiamine and Folate, then replete
   - f/u urine cx
   - if agitated once extubated, consider Haldol only as needed
   - clear c-spine once awake and extubated, with a negative CT scan, low
   risk for ligamentous injury given mechanism of fall
   .
   Syncope/Fall - Per report, pt lost consciousness before she fell.  Per
   son and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of
   consciousness.  Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension,
   MI, or other neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive
   work-up at [**Hospital3 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood
   glucose 156 in field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not
   available in [**Hospital3 140**] records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG,
   cardiac enzymes negative x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to
   facilitate beta 2-receptor blockade and assist with some possible
   neurogenic causes of her symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink
   anything but coffee that he is aware of and is often light-headed when
   she stands up.  BBlocker and/or CCB could be contributing to
   hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia
   - Check B12, Thimaine and Folate, then replete
   - ROMI, cardiac enzymes negative x1
   - consider carotid dopplers
   - continue gently volume resuscitation
   - hold BBlocker and calcium channel blocker for now
   - XRs negative
   .
   Resp Failure
 Intubated in setting of altered MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] acute pulmonary
   issues. On minimal settings.
   - Plan to extubate this AM if following commands off sedation
   .
   Elevated Lactate - Differential includes infection versus muscle
   exertion in setting of extreme agitation and combativeness.  Likely due
   to the latter.  With time and gentle fluids acidemia and elevated
   lactate have resolved.
   - normalized lactate by AM
   .
   Elevated troponin
 Trop is still in indeterminate range but has
   trended up from <0.01 to 0.04 this AM. CK also trending up but MD flat.
   - Repeat EKG
   - Cycle enzymes until trajectory is evident
   - Fluids for CKs

   Hypertension - on HCTZ and amlodipine
   - will hold for now
   .
   Hyperlipidemia - on lescol at home
   - will restart when extubated

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 89-year-old female who was brought to the emergency department after a witnessed fall, where she struck her head on the ground. She was intubated in the emergency department for altered mental status, and her labs were mostly unremarkable, except for mildly elevated lactate and acidemia, which was attributed to her violent thrashing prior to sedation and intubation.

The patient's history was obtained from her son, who reports that she falls frequently and is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**]. Syncope work-ups have been unrevealing to date.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated with minimal settings, plan to extubate in the morning if she follows commands off sedation.
* Neurological: Altered mental status, pinpoint pupils, and muscle wasting.
* Cardiovascular: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and syncope, with a negative head CT and cardiac enzymes.
* Infectious: No signs of infection, but blood cultures are pending.
* Metabolic: Elevated lactate and acidemia, which have resolved with gentle fluids and time.
* Nutritional: NPO, gentle fluids, and electrolyte repletion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if she is not extubated successfully.
* Infection: Despite the lack of signs of infection, blood cultures are pending, and there is a risk of infection if the patient is not treated promptly.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of syncope and hypertension, and there is a risk of cardiac complications if her blood pressure is not controlled.
* Metabolic complications: The patient has elevated lactate and acidemia, which can lead to metabolic complications if not managed properly.
* Neurological complications: The patient has altered mental status and muscle wasting, which can lead to neurological complications if not managed properly.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Extubation in the morning if she follows commands off sedation.
* Restarting medications, including antihypertensives and cholesterol-lowering medication, once extubated.
* Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotics as necessary.
* Continuing gentle fluids and electrolyte repletion.
* Considering carotid dopplers and cardiac enzymes to rule out cardiac complications.
* Holding beta blockers and calcium channel blockers for now.
* Clearing the patient's cervical spine once awake and extubated.
* Considering Haldol only as needed if the patient becomes agitated once extubated."

 FALL(S)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was
   violently thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With
   gentle fluids and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's
   histroy was obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite
   frequently.  She is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope
   work-ups have been unrevealing todate.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was
   violently thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With
   gentle fluids and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's
   histroy was obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite
   frequently.  She is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope
   work-ups have been unrevealing todate.
   .
   Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - blood cx is spikes
   - no antibiotics for now in absence of signs of infection
   - decrease sedation and extubate in am
   - check B12, Thiamine and Folate, then replete
   .
   Syncope - Per report, pt lost consiousness before she fell.  Per son
   and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of consciousness.
   Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension, MI, or other
   neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive work-up at [**Hospital1 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood glucose 156 in
   field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not available in [**Hospital3 140**]
   records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG, cardiac enzymes negative
   x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to facilitate beta 2-receptor
   blockade and assist with some possible neurogenic causes of her
   symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink anything but coffee that
   he is aware of and is often light-headed when she stands up.  BBlocke
   rnad/or CCB could be contributing to hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia
   - Check B12, Thimaine and Folate, then replete
   - ROMI, cardiac enzymes negative x1
   - consider carotid dopplers
   - conitnue gently volume resuscitation
   - hold BBlocker and calcium channel blocker for now
   .
   Elevated Lactate - Differential includes infection versus muscle
   exertion in setting of extreme agtation and combativeness.  Liklely due
   to the latter.  With time and gentle fluids acidemia and elevated
   lactate have resolved.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 89-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground. She was intubated in the ED for altered mental status and has been on invasive ventilation since then.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, and blood pressure of 150/44 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on 40% FiO2. Her respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator with a tidal volume of 365 mL and a respiratory rate of 25.

The patient's laboratory results show mild elevations in her white blood cell count and lactate levels, but these have trended down with gentle fluids. Her cardiac enzymes and troponin levels are normal. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and syncope, for which she has undergone extensive work-up at another hospital without a definitive diagnosis. She is currently on beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, which may be contributing to her hypotension and bradyarrhythmia.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Alteration in nutrition: NPO, gentle fluids, repletion of electrolytes, B12, thiamine, and folate
* Altered mental status: Decrease sedation and extubate in the morning
* Syncope: Check B12, thiamine, and folate, then replete; ROMI, cardiac enzymes negative x1; consider carotid dopplers; continue gentle volume resuscitation; hold beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers for now
* Elevated lactate: Recheck in the morning
* Hypertension: Hold for now
* Hyperlipidemia: Restart when extubated
* Prophylaxis: Heparin sc, VAP bundle, pneumoboots, PT/OT consult

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is still on invasive ventilation, which carries risks such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and barotrauma.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and hyperlipidemia increase her risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke.
* Infection: The patient's mild elevation in white blood cell count and lactate levels may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
* Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and syncope increase her risk of neurological complications such as seizures and cerebral edema.
* Nutritional complications: The patient's altered nutrition plan may lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances if not carefully managed.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FALL(S)
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  Head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was violently
   thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With gentle fluids
   and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's history was
   obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite frequently.  She
   is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope work-ups have been
   unrevealing to date.
   .
   Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - blood cx is spikes
   - no antibiotics for now in absence of signs of infection
   - decrease sedation and extubate in am
   - check B12, Thiamine and Folate, then replete
   - f/u urine cx
   - if agitated once extubated, consider Haldol only as needed
   - clear c-spine once awake and extubated, with a negative CT scan, low
   risk for ligamentous injury given mechanism of fall
   .
   Syncope/Fall - Per report, pt lost consciousness before she fell.  Per
   son and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of
   consciousness.  Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension,
   MI, or other neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive
   work-up at [**Hospital3 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood
   glucose 156 in field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not
   available in [**Hospital3 140**] records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG,
   cardiac enzymes negative x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to
   facilitate beta 2-receptor blockade and assist with some possible
   neurogenic causes of her symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink
   anything but coffee that he is aware of and is often light-headed when
   she stands up.  BBlocker and/or CCB could be contributing to
   hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia
   - Check B12, Thimaine and Folate, then replete
   - ROMI, cardiac enzymes negative x1
   - consider carotid dopplers
   - continue gently volume resuscitation
   - hold BBlocker and calcium channel blocker for now
   - XRs negative
   .
   Resp Failure
 Intubated in setting of altered MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] acute pulmonary
   issues. On minimal settings.
   - Plan to extubate this AM if following commands off sedation
   .
   Elevated Lactate - Differential includes infection versus muscle
   exertion in setting of extreme agitation and combativeness.  Likely due
   to the latter.  With time and gentle fluids acidemia and elevated
   lactate have resolved.
   - normalized lactate by AM
   .
   Elevated troponin
 Trop is still in indeterminate range but has
   trended up from <0.01 to 0.04 this AM. CK also trending up but MD flat.
   - Repeat EKG
   - Cycle enzymes until trajectory is evident
   - Fluids for CKs
   .
   Hypertension - on HCTZ and amlodipine
   - will hold for now
   .
   Hyperlipidemia - on lescol at home
   - will restart when extubated
   .
   FEN - NPO, gentle fluids, replete lytes, replete B12, thiamine and
   folate
   .
   Proph - Heparin sq, VAP bundle, pneumoboots, PT/OT consult once
   extubated

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 89-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU after a witnessed fall, where she struck her head on the ground. She was intubated in the emergency department for altered mental status, and her head CT scan was negative for acute bleeding.

The patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and syncope, for which she has undergone extensive work-up at a previous hospital without revealing a cause. She has been taking a beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker, which may be contributing to her hypotension and bradycardia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: Intubated on minimal settings, with a plan to extubate in the morning if she follows commands off sedation.
* Cardiovascular: Hypertension is being managed with amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide, which will be held for now. The patient's troponin level is elevated, but the trajectory is unclear.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is within normal limits.
* Hepatic: The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits.
* Neurological: The patient has altered mental status, which may be due to trauma, toxic metabolic, infection, or delirium.
* Infectious: The patient has a mildly elevated white blood cell count, but her CXR and UA are negative for occult infection.
* Nutritional: The patient is NPO, receiving gentle fluids, and will be replete with electrolytes, B12, thiamine, and folate.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving heparin for DVT prophylaxis, PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and HOB elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up for VAP prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is fragile, and extubation may be challenging.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's troponin level is elevated, and her cardiac enzymes are negative, but the trajectory is unclear. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the elevated troponin level.
* Infection: The patient's mildly elevated white blood cell count and negative CXR and UA may indicate occult infection, which needs to be further evaluated.
* Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to delirium, which needs to be managed with sedation and other interventions.
* Skin integrity issues: The patient's skin is warm and has diffuse ecchymosis, which may indicate skin integrity issues.
* Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and she may require enteral nutrition or other interventions to prevent malnutrition.

In conclusion, the patient is a high-risk individual who requires close monitoring and management of her various medical conditions. Further evaluation and management are needed to determine the cause of her elevated troponin level, delirium, and potential skin integrity issues."

   Assessment and Plan
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  Head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was violently
   thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With gentle fluids
   and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's history was
   obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite frequently.  She
   is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope work-ups have been
   unrevealing to date.
   # Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - Follow-up blood cx
   - Levofloxacin for PNA
   -  replete B12, Thiamine and Folate
   - f/u urine cx
   # Syncope/Fall - Per report, pt lost consciousness before she fell.
   Per son and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of
   consciousness.  Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension,
   MI, or other neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive
   work-up at [**Hospital3 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood
   glucose 156 in field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not
   available in [**Hospital3 140**] records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG,
   cardiac enzymes negative x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to
   facilitate beta 2-receptor blockade and assist with some possible
   neurogenic causes of her symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink
   anything but coffee that he is aware of and is often light-headed when
   she stands up.  BBlocker and/or CCB could be contributing to
   hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia
   - Check B12, Thimaine and Folate, then replete
   - Carotid dopplers

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   89 F with h/o of HTN, hyperlipidemia and syncope who was brought to the
   ED after a witnessed fall where her head struck the ground.  Pt was
   intubated in the ED for altered mental status so that a thorough
   work-up could be conducted.  Head CT was negative and patients labs
   were by-in-large unremarkable.  She did have a mildly elevated lactate
   and acidemia that were attributed to the fact that she was violently
   thrashing around prior to sedation and intubation.  With gentle fluids
   and time, her lactate has come back down.  The patient's history was
   obtained from her son who reports that she falls quite frequently.  She
   is normally seen at [**Hospital6 5579**].  Syncope work-ups have been
   unrevealing to date.
   # Altered Mental Status - Son reports that patient fully mentally
   competent at baseline with only mild senility.  Etiologies of agitation
   and alteration today could include trauma [**1-11**] fall, toxic metabolic,
   infection or delirium.  Head CT negative for acute bleed.  Pt had
   mildly elevated white blood cell count on admission, however, trended
   down to normal with gently fluids.  CXR and UA negative for occult
   infection.
   - Follow-up blood cx
   - Levofloxacin for PNA
   -  replete B12, Thiamine and Folate
   - f/u urine cx
   # Syncope/Fall - Per report, pt lost consciousness before she fell.
   Per son and friend, she falls often in the setting of a loss of
   consciousness.  Etiologies include vaso-vagal, orthostatic hypotension,
   MI, or other neurologic cause such as seizure, TIA, etc.  Extensive
   work-up at [**Hospital3 **] over the years has been unrevealing.  Blood
   glucose 156 in field. Pt had ECHO in [**Month (only) 25**] but report is not
   available in [**Hospital3 140**] records.  No evidence of arrhthymia on EKG,
   cardiac enzymes negative x1.  Per [**Hospital3 140**] notes, on B-Blocker to
   facilitate beta 2-receptor blockade and assist with some possible
   neurogenic causes of her symptoms.  Per son's report, pt does not drink
   anything but coffee that he is aware of and is often light-headed when
   she stands up.  BBlocker and/or CCB could be contributing to
   hypotension and or bradyarrhythmia
   - Check B12, Thimaine and Folate, then replete
   - Carotid dopplers
 follow-up final read
   - continue gently volume resuscitation
   - hold BBlocker and calcium channel blocker for now
   .
   Resp Failure
 Intubated in setting of altered MS. [**Name13 (STitle) **] acute pulmonary
   issues. On minimal settings.
   - Extubated [**2-16**] AM
   #  Elevated Lactate - Differential includes infection versus muscle
   exertion in setting of extreme agitation and combativeness.  Likely due
   to the latter.  With time and gentle fluids acidemia and elevated
   lactate have resolved.
   - normalized lactate by AM
   # Elevated troponin
 Trop is still in indeterminate range but has
   trended up from <0.01 to 0.04 this AM. CK also trending up but MD flat.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress as follows:

* The patient is a 89-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, intubated, and on invasive ventilation.
* She was successfully extubated, but developed new hypoxia to mid-80s and was called out to the floor.
* The patient's condition worsened, with increased lung opacity on CXR, poor cough and minimal gag, and worsened leukocytosis.
* She was started on Levofloxacin for CAP, and her medications were adjusted accordingly.
* The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/47 mmHg.
* Her respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery, PSV/SBT ventilator mode, and FiO2 of 35%.
* The patient's physical examination is notable for poor dentition, muscle wasting, and diffuse ecchymosis.
* Laboratory results show mildly elevated WBC count, Hct, and Plt, as well as elevated TropT and CK levels.
* Imaging studies, including head CT and carotid Dopplers, are negative for acute bleed and occlusion.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is precarious, and further deterioration may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and worsening lung opacity on CXR suggest a possible infection, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels and CK trending up may indicate cardiac injury or ischemia, which requires close monitoring and further evaluation.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and further deterioration may lead to hypotension, which may require further treatment and monitoring.
5. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and agitation may indicate delirium, which requires further evaluation and treatment.
6. Fall risk: The patient's history of falls and altered mental status may increase her risk of further falls, which requires close monitoring and fall prevention measures.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show mild electrolyte imbalances, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's history of falls and altered mental status may indicate a risk of nutritional deficiencies, which requires further evaluation and treatment.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and further evaluation to address these potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 89-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing recurrent syncope and falling. She was intubated due to agitation and needed an emergent head CT scan. She was extubated and was scheduled to be transferred to the floor, but developed hypoxia and a right lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. She was restarted on invasive ventilation and is currently receiving levofloxacin for pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 143/51 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin build, with normal head, ears, nose, and throat. Her cardiovascular examination shows a normal pulse and blood pressure, with a normal respiratory rate. Her abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a normal platelet count. Her liver function tests are normal, with a slightly elevated troponin level. Her electrolyte levels are normal, with a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's medical history is significant for a fall, syncope, and pneumonia. Her medications include levofloxacin, pantoprazole, and heparin.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and aspiration pneumonitis may lead to respiratory failure, which could worsen her condition.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and aspiration pneumonitis may lead to sepsis, which could worsen her condition.
3. Pneumonia complications: The patient's pneumonia may lead to complications such as pleural effusion, empyema, or lung abscess.
4. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient's aspiration pneumonitis may lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, or other complications.
5. Syncope: The patient's syncope may be related to her fall and may lead to further complications.
6. Pneumonia-related complications: The patient's pneumonia may lead to complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, or other complications.
7. Skin integrity issues: The patient's impaired skin integrity may lead to further complications such as pressure ulcers or skin infections.
8. Nutritional issues: The patient's altered mental status and impaired swallow function may lead to nutritional issues such as malnutrition or dehydration.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and syncope may lead to cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
10. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's pneumonia and aspiration pneumonitis may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a complex medical history. The patient has been admitted with respiratory failure, syncope, hypertension, and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 143/51 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 95%.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with diminished breath sounds diffusely and a history of aspiration pneumonia in the right lower lobe. The patient is receiving levofloxacin for treatment of the aspiration pneumonia.

The patient's mental status is altered, with a history of falls and impaired skin integrity. The patient has a recent history of syncope, which has been extensively worked up and is currently under investigation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a complex medical picture, with abnormalities in blood counts, electrolytes, and liver function tests. The patient has a history of hypertension and is being treated with home medications, which are currently being held.

The patient's nutrition is compromised, with a history of altered mental status and impaired skin integrity. The patient's glycemic control is well-controlled, with a blood sugar level of 101 mg/dL.

The patient has multiple lines in place, including an 18-gauge and 20-gauge central venous catheter, as well as a urinary catheter. The patient is receiving prophylactic therapy for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's disposition is planned to be transferred to the floor, pending further evaluation and treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's compromised respiratory status and history of aspiration pneumonia put them at risk for further respiratory decline.
* Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and impaired skin integrity make them susceptible to sepsis.
* Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's history of hypertension and immobilization in the ICU make them at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis.
* Stress ulcer: The patient's history of impaired skin integrity and altered mental status make them at risk for developing stress ulcer.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient's compromised nutrition and history of altered mental status make them at risk for developing hypoglycemia.
* Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and history of impaired skin integrity make them susceptible to infection.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and adjusting their treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications from arising."
