   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right femoral
   bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, ARF, and DKA.
   .
   #. DKA:
   Dx: Etiology unclear. Leading diagnosis is noncompliance with insulin.
   Infectious causes generally ruled out with negative cultures, CXR.
   Right foot remains possible source of infection.
   - Continue aggressive maintenance fluids including sugar replacement as
   D5 3amps of bicarb may be contributing to hypoglycemia.
   - Advance diet as tolerated
   - recheck evening lytes, replete prn
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: New onset this AM after exam. Abdomen benign.
   - DDx includes gastroparesis, anxiety. LFTs, amylase, lipase WNL.
   - pain management with home hydrocodone and home ativan.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely a result of profound dehydration,
   improving with IVF.
   -Continue aggressive volume resuscitation as above, check urine lytes
   -Continue nephrocaps
   -Renally dose all meds
   .
   #. Cocaine abuse: Urine tox screen is positive for cocaine, prior OMR
   notes indicate that this is an ongoing problem.
   - Avoiding BB to prevent unopposed alpha effects of cocaine
   - SW consult on the floor
   .
   #. Type 1 DM:
   - continue SC sugar control
   - diabetic diet
   - teaching re insulin
   .
   #. CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction. Tolerated fluid
   resuscitation without hypoxia or dyspnea
   - Ruled out for MI, had previously had NSTEMI in setting of cocaine and
   DKA
   - Hold BB (in setting of active cocaine) and lisinopril as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

Summary:

* The patient is a 38-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus, severe peripheral vascular disease, and a history of cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and diabetic ketoacidosis.
* She has undergone a recent right femoral bypass and is currently experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.
* The patient is on various medications, including insulin, heparin, and ASA, and is receiving IV fluids and sugar replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. **DKA**: The patient's blood glucose levels are still elevated, and the etiology of DKA is unclear. The patient may require further treatment, including insulin and sugar replacement therapy, to manage her blood glucose levels and prevent further complications.
2. **Acute Renal Failure**: The patient's acute renal failure is likely related to profound dehydration, and she requires continued aggressive volume resuscitation to prevent further kidney damage.
3. **Abdominal Pain**: The patient's abdominal pain is likely related to gastroparesis, anxiety, or other underlying conditions. Further evaluation, including imaging studies, may be necessary to determine the cause of the pain and provide appropriate treatment.
4. **Cocaine Abuse**: The patient's urine tox screen is positive for cocaine, and she requires ongoing treatment and counseling to manage her addiction.
5. **Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus**: The patient requires continued management of her type 1 diabetes, including insulin therapy, dietary modifications, and education on proper insulin use.
6. **CAD with Biventricular Systolic Dysfunction**: The patient has a history of CAD with biventricular systolic dysfunction, and she requires ongoing management of her cardiac condition, including medication and lifestyle modifications.
7. **Chronic Pain**: The patient has a history of chronic pain, and she requires ongoing management of her pain, including medication and non-pharmacological interventions.
8. **Anxiety/Depression**: The patient has a history of anxiety and depression, and she requires ongoing treatment and counseling to manage her mental health.
9. **Chronic Anemia**: The patient has a history of chronic anemia, and she requires ongoing management of her anemia, including blood transfusions and iron supplements.
10. **PVD**: The patient has a history of PVD, and she requires ongoing management of her vascular condition, including lifestyle modifications and medication.

Based on this summary and potential medical complications, it is essential to continue monitoring the patient's condition closely and providing ongoing treatment and management to prevent further complications and improve her overall health and well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right femoral
   bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, ARF, and DKA.
   .
   #. DKA: unclear source, possibly medication non-compliance vs.
   infection.  No signs of cardiac ischemia.  Leukocytosis may be real or
   hemoconcentration, as all cell lines are elevated.  UA and CXR are
   non-focal, only possible infectious source is her right foot.
   -Liberal volume resuscitation with isotonic fluid (NS), likely needs
   7-10% of body weight repleted.  Will watch respiratory status closely
   given h/o bisystolic dysfunction.
   -Insulin infusion at 5-6units/hr (0.1units/kg/hr) until blood sugar
   normalizes and anion gap closes, will avoid >100unit decrements/hour.
   -Will monitor q2H pH, electrolytes, and q1H FSBS
   -Add 5% dextrose to fluids when BS <250 to allow for insulin gtt to
   infuse
   -Stop insulin/dextrose when BS <250, and anion gap closes, and provide
   home dose of SC 75/25 insulin dose.
   -Add potassium to repletion fluids once <4.5
   -Re-check a set of cardiac enzymes at 12H, f/u infectious w/u
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 51**] be real, or a result of hemoconcentration, as all
   cell lines are up, and trending down with fluids.  Possible source
   would be her gangrenous right foot.
   -Follow up blood and urine cultures, repeat UA, and follow up CXR read
   -No signs of active infection at the moment, vancomycin should stay on
   board given renal function.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely a result of profound dehydration, as
   evidenced by BUN/Cr ratio >20 in the setting of DKA.
   -Continue aggressive volume resuscitation as above
   -Continue nephrocaps
   -Renally dose all meds
   .
   #. Cocaine abuse: Urine tox screen is positive for cocaine, prior OMR
   notes indicate that this is an ongoing problem.
   -Hold home regimen of metoprolol, and will discuss possible dangers of
   beta blockers in this patient with PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) **] consult on the floor
   .
   #. Type 1 DM:
   -Manage DKA as above, will initiate home regimen of insulin once
   stabilized.
   -Continue ASA ppx
   .
   #. CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction
   -Will monitor closely during volume resuscitation for signs of hypoxia
   -Hold BB and lisinopril as above
   -Continue ASA PPX
   -Will order echocardiogram in AM to assess EF, as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 669**] planned to
   obtain one in his recent note.
   .
   #. Chronic Pain
   -Continue home regimen of oxycodone once blood pressure is stable, and
   mental status clears
   .
   #. Anxiety/depression
   -continue home regimen of clonazepam and lorazapam once blood pressure
   is stable and mental status clears
   .
   #. Chronic anemia: Baseline 25-30, currently [**Last Name (LF) 6052**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   monitor with daily labs.
   .
   #. Hepatitis B: stable, no active issues.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 38-year-old female with type 1 diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, and a history of cocaine abuse, is admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's DKA is likely caused by non-compliance with medication or an infection, possibly from her right foot. The patient is receiving liberal volume resuscitation with isotonic fluids and insulin infusion to manage her DKA. The patient's leukocytosis may be due to real infection or hemoconcentration. The patient's acute renal failure is likely caused by profound dehydration. The patient has a history of cocaine abuse and is being treated with vancomycin for possible infection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's right foot is a possible source of infection, and the patient's leukocytosis may indicate a real infection. The patient's urine and blood cultures should be followed up, and repeat UA and CXR should be performed to monitor for signs of infection.
2. Acidosis: The patient's DKA is a life-threatening condition that requires close monitoring and treatment. The patient's acidosis may worsen if not properly managed, leading to cardiac arrest or other complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, or other complications.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of cocaine abuse and bisystolic dysfunction may increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may be a sign of cerebral edema or other neurological complications, which require close monitoring and treatment.
6. Infection-related complications: The patient's infection may lead to sepsis, septic shock, or other complications if not properly managed.
7. Medication-related complications: The patient's medication regimen, including insulin and vancomycin, may cause adverse effects or interact with other medications, leading to complications.
8. Nutritional complications: The patient's nutritional status may be compromised due to her illness, leading to malnutrition, dehydration, or other complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical status closely.
2. Adjust the patient's insulin infusion rate and fluid management to ensure proper management of her DKA.
3. Follow up the patient's urine and blood cultures, and repeat UA and CXR to monitor for signs of infection.
4. Continue to manage the patient's acidosis and electrolyte imbalances closely.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely, and consider consulting cardiology for further management.
6. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely, and consider consulting neurology for further management.
7. Adjust the patient's medication regimen as needed to minimize adverse effects and interactions.
8. Monitor the patient's nutritional status closely, and consider consulting nutrition for further management."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right femoral
   bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, ARF, and DKA.
   .
   #. DKA: unclear source, possibly medication non-compliance vs.
   infection.  No signs of cardiac ischemia.  Leukocytosis may be real or
   hemoconcentration, as all cell lines are elevated.  UA and CXR are
   non-focal, only possible infectious source is her right foot.
   -Liberal volume resuscitation with isotonic fluid (NS), likely needs
   7-10% of body weight repleted.  Will watch respiratory status closely
   given h/o bisystolic dysfunction.
   -Insulin infusion at 5-6units/hr (0.1units/kg/hr) until blood sugar
   normalizes and anion gap closes, will avoid >100unit decrements/hour.
   -Will monitor q2H pH, electrolytes, and q1H FSBS
   -Add 5% dextrose to fluids when BS <250 to allow for insulin gtt to
   infuse
   -Stop insulin/dextrose when BS <250, and anion gap closes, and provide
   home dose of SC 75/25 insulin dose.
   -Add potassium to repletion fluids once <4.5
   -Re-check a set of cardiac enzymes at 12H, f/u infectious w/u
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 51**] be real, or a result of hemoconcentration, as all
   cell lines are up, and trending down with fluids.  Possible source
   would be her gangrenous right foot.
   -Follow up blood and urine cultures, repeat UA, and follow up CXR read
   -No signs of active infection at the moment, vancomycin should stay on
   board given renal function.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely a result of profound dehydration, as
   evidenced by BUN/Cr ratio >20 in the setting of DKA.
   -Continue aggressive volume resuscitation as above
   -Continue nephrocaps
   -Renally dose all meds
   .
   #. Cocaine abuse: Urine tox screen is positive for cocaine, prior OMR
   notes indicate that this is an ongoing problem.
   -Hold home regimen of metoprolol, and will discuss possible dangers of
   beta blockers in this patient with PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) **] consult on the floor
   .
   #. Type 1 DM:
   -Manage DKA as above, will initiate home regimen of insulin once
   stabilized.
   -Continue ASA ppx
   .
   #. CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction
   -Will monitor closely during volume resuscitation for signs of hypoxia
   -Hold BB and lisinopril as above
   -Continue ASA PPX
   -Will order echocardiogram in AM to assess EF, as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 669**] planned to
   obtain one in his recent note.
   .
   #. Chronic Pain
   -Continue home regimen of oxycodone once blood pressure is stable, and
   mental status clears
   .
   #. Anxiety/depression
   -continue home regimen of clonazepam and lorazapam once blood pressure
   is stable and mental status clears
   .
   #. Chronic anemia: Baseline 25-30, currently [**Last Name (LF) 6052**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   monitor with daily labs.
   .
   #. Hepatitis B: stable, no active issues.
   .
   #. PVD: Will let Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2494**] know of her admission.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38 F with Type 1 DM and severe
   PVD. She is admitted to the MICU for DKA. Her tox screen is also
   positive for cocaine.
   Exam notable for Tm 96 F BP 97/60 HR 78 RR 10-16/min. Labs notable for
   HCO3 11 and venous pH 7.15. Pt is difficult to arouse, heart with RR,
   no gallops/rubs/murmurs. Lung sounds are clear. Abd is soft and
   nontender. Agree with plan to continue fluids and IV insulin and follow
   anion gap.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill due to acidosis and hyperglycemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right femoral
   bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, ARF, and DKA.
   .
   #. DKA: unclear source, possibly medication non-compliance vs.
   infection.  No signs of cardiac ischemia.  Leukocytosis may be real or
   hemoconcentration, as all cell lines are elevated.  UA and CXR are
   non-focal, only possible infectious source is her right foot.
   -Liberal volume resuscitation with isotonic fluid (NS), likely needs
   7-10% of body weight repleted.  Will watch respiratory status closely
   given h/o bisystolic dysfunction.
   -Insulin infusion at 5-6units/hr (0.1units/kg/hr) until blood sugar
   normalizes and anion gap closes, will avoid >100unit decrements/hour.
   -Will monitor q2H pH, electrolytes, and q1H FSBS
   -Add 5% dextrose to fluids when BS <250 to allow for insulin gtt to
   infuse
   -Stop insulin/dextrose when BS <250, and anion gap closes, and provide
   home dose of SC 75/25 insulin dose.
   -Add potassium to repletion fluids once <4.5
   -Re-check a set of cardiac enzymes at 12H, f/u infectious w/u
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 51**] be real, or a result of hemoconcentration, as all
   cell lines are up, and trending down with fluids.  Possible source
   would be her gangrenous right foot.
   -Follow up blood and urine cultures, repeat UA, and follow up CXR read
   -No signs of active infection at the moment, vancomycin should stay on
   board given renal function.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely a result of profound dehydration, as
   evidenced by BUN/Cr ratio >20 in the setting of DKA.
   -Continue aggressive volume resuscitation as above
   -Continue nephrocaps
   -Renally dose all meds
   .
   #. Cocaine abuse: Urine tox screen is positive for cocaine, prior OMR
   notes indicate that this is an ongoing problem.
   -Hold home regimen of metoprolol, and will discuss possible dangers of
   beta blockers in this patient with PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) **] consult on the floor
   .
   #. Type 1 DM:
   -Manage DKA as above, will initiate home regimen of insulin once
   stabilized.
   -Continue ASA ppx
   .
   #. CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction
   -Will monitor closely during volume resuscitation for signs of hypoxia
   -Hold BB and lisinopril as above
   -Continue ASA PPX
   -Will order echocardiogram in AM to assess EF, as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 669**] planned to
   obtain one in his recent note.
   .
   #. Chronic Pain
   -Continue home regimen of oxycodone once blood pressure is stable, and
   mental status clears
   .
   #. Anxiety/depression
   -continue home regimen of clonazepam and lorazapam once blood pressure
   is stable and mental status clears
   .
   #. Chronic anemia: Baseline 25-30, currently [**Last Name (LF) 6052**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   monitor with daily labs.
   .
   #. Hepatitis B: stable, no active issues.
   .
   #. PVD: Will let Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2494**] know of her admission.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38 F with Type 1 DM and severe
   PVD. She is admitted to the MICU for DKA. Her tox screen is also
   positive for cocaine.
   Exam notable for Tm 96 F BP 97/60 HR 78 RR 10-16/min. Labs notable for
   HCO3 11 and venous pH 7.15. Pt is difficult to arouse, heart with RR,
   no gallops/rubs/murmurs. Lung sounds are clear. Abd is soft and
   nontender. Agree with plan to continue fluids and IV insulin and follow
   anion gap.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill due to acidosis and hyperglycemia.

   #. DKA: Pt
s gap closed as of yesterday morning. However pt missed AM
   dose of long acting 75/25 (15u), and gap opened up in evening up to 20,
   currently 17.  Overnight BS mostly 100-200, and regular insulin without
   successful closure of gap. Cause of re-opening of gap likely from
   insufficient insulin over the day. [**Month (only) 51**] have other sourse of AG, lactate
   stable. No meds contributing.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 38-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus, severe peripheral vascular disease, and a history of cocaine abuse. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has been experiencing abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting throughout the night. Her glucose levels have been unstable, and her gap has opened up to 17 mmol/L. She has been treated with insulin, fluids, and electrolyte replacement.

Potential medical complications:

1. DKA: The patient's gap has opened up to 17 mmol/L, indicating that her DKA is not fully resolved. She requires continued treatment with insulin, fluids, and electrolyte replacement to prevent further complications.
2. ARF: The patient's creatinine level has decreased to 1.0 mg/dL, indicating that her acute renal failure is resolving. However, she may still require further treatment to prevent further complications.
3. PVD: The patient's peripheral vascular disease may increase her risk of developing further complications, such as limb ischemia or gangrene.
4. Cocaine abuse: The patient's history of cocaine abuse may increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
5. Anxiety and depression: The patient's history of anxiety and depression may increase her risk of developing further complications, such as suicidal ideation or self-harm.
6. Hepatitis B: The patient's history of hepatitis B may increase her risk of developing further complications, such as liver failure or liver cancer.
7. Chronic anemia: The patient's chronic anemia may increase her risk of developing further complications, such as cardiovascular disease or infections.
8. CAD with biventricular systolic dysfunction: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and biventricular systolic dysfunction may increase her risk of developing further complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

ICU care plan:

1. Continue treatment with insulin, fluids, and electrolyte replacement to manage the patient's DKA and ARF.
2. Monitor the patient's glucose levels closely and adjust her insulin dose as needed.
3. Continue to provide supportive care, such as oxygen therapy and pain management.
4. Consider consulting a cardiologist to manage the patient's cardiovascular disease.
5. Consider consulting a psychiatrist to manage the patient's anxiety and depression.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and adjust her treatment plan as needed.
7. Consider consulting a hematologist to manage the patient's chronic anemia.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust her treatment plan as needed."

   bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, ARF, and DKA.
   .
   #. DKA:
   Dx: Etiology unclear. Leading diagnosis is noncompliance with insulin.
   Infectious causes generally ruled out with negative cultures, CXR.
   Right foot remains possible source of infection.
   - Continue aggressive maintenance fluids including sugar replacement as
   D5 3amps of bicarb may be contributing to hypoglycemia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right femoral
   bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, ARF, and DKA.
   .
   #. DKA:
   Dx: Etiology unclear. Leading diagnosis is noncompliance with insulin.
   Infectious causes generally ruled out with negative cultures, CXR.
   Right foot remains possible source of infection.
   - Continue aggressive maintenance fluids including sugar replacement as
   D5 3amps of bicarb may be contributing to hypoglycemia.
   - Advance diet as tolerated
   - recheck evening lytes, replete prn
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: New onset this AM after exam. Abdomen benign.
   - DDx includes gastroparesis, anxiety. LFTs, amylase, lipase WNL.
   - pain management with home hydrocodone and home ativan.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely a result of profound dehydration,
   improving with IVF.
   -Continue aggressive volume resuscitation as above, check urine lytes
   -Continue nephrocaps
   -Renally dose all meds
   .
   #. Cocaine abuse: Urine tox screen is positive for cocaine, prior OMR
   notes indicate that this is an ongoing problem.
   - Avoiding BB to prevent unopposed alpha effects of cocaine
   - SW consult on the floor
   .
   #. Type 1 DM:
   - continue SC sugar control
   - diabetic diet
   - teaching re insulin
   .
   #. CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction. Tolerated fluid
   resuscitation without hypoxia or dyspnea
   - Ruled out for MI, had previously had NSTEMI in setting of cocaine and
   DKA
   - Hold BB (in setting of active cocaine) and lisinopril as above
   - Continue ASA
   - Recheck echo
   .
   #. Chronic Pain
   -Continue home regimen of oxycodone once blood pressure is stable, and
   mental status clears
   .
   #. Anxiety/depression
   - restart home ativan and clonaxepam now that mental status cleared
   .
   #. Chronic anemia: Baseline 25-30, improved to near baseline with IVF.
   .
   #. Hepatitis B: stable, no active issues.
   .
   #. PVD: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2494**] informed of admission as had recent surgery
   .
   # FEN: Diabetic diet, maintenance fluids with D5 3amps of bicarb if not
   tolerating POs, lytes prn
   # PPx: SC hep, no need for PPI, bowel regimen and pain control

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 38-year-old female with type 1 diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a history of cocaine abuse. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, leukocytosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 99 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 167/74 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. She has a sinus tachycardia heart rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 15.4 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL
* Platelet count: 576 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 22 mEq/L
* Sodium: 134 mEq/L
* Potassium: 3.7 mEq/L
* Chloride: 97 mEq/L
* Carbon dioxide: 29.8%
* Glucose: 266 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.1 mmol/L
* Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL
* CK: 262 IU/L
* CKMB: 10.0 ng/mL

The patient's physical examination is notable for a lack of peripheral pulses in both legs, and she has a history of recent right femoral bypass surgery. Her skin examination is not documented, and her neurologic examination is not assessed.

The patient's diagnosis includes DKA, acute renal failure, abdominal pain, cocaine abuse, type 1 diabetes, and chronic pain. The plan includes:

* Continue aggressive maintenance fluids, including sugar replacement, to manage DKA
* Advance diet as tolerated
* Recheck evening electrolytes and replete as needed
* Continue nephrocaps to manage acute renal failure
* Renally dose all medications
* Avoid beta blockers to prevent unopposed alpha effects of cocaine
* Consult with a social worker to address the patient's ongoing cocaine abuse
* Continue insulin therapy and diabetic diet
* Restart home ativan and clonazepam for anxiety and depression
* Continue oxycodone for chronic pain

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Hypoglycemia due to aggressive sugar replacement and insulin therapy
* Infection, particularly in the right foot, which may be a source of sepsis
* Cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction, due to the patient's history of cocaine abuse and type 1 diabetes
* Renal failure, which may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed aggressively
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as gastroparesis, due to the patient's history of cocaine abuse and diabetes
* Anxiety and depression, which may worsen if not managed with appropriate therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right femoral
   bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, ARF, and DKA.
   .
   #. DKA: Pt
s gap closed as of yesterday morning. However pt missed AM
   dose of long acting 75/25 (15u), and gap opened up in evening up to 20,
   currently 17.  Overnight BS mostly 100-200, and regular insulin without
   successful closure of gap. Cause of re-opening of gap likely from
   insufficient insulin over the day. [**Month (only) 51**] have other sourse of AG, lactate
   stable. No meds contributing.
   - restarting insulin gtt
   - replete electrolytes prn
   - replacing fluids lost from polyuria D5 1/2NS
   - advance diet when tolerated

   # HTN- BP upto 190s/120s. Metop was stopped b/c of cocaine use.
   - will start captopril today (transition to lisinopril later)
   #. Tachycardia- likely [**3-7**] hypovolemia and pain
   - restarting metop 50 TID.
   #. Acute renal failure: resolved, pre-renal, now Cr 1.0
   #. Cocaine abuse: SW consult when on floor, stop metop when d/c from
   likely use of cocaine when d/c
   ..
   #. Anxiety/depression- restarted home ativan and clonaxepam
   #. CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction. Tolerated fluid
   resuscitation without hypoxia or dyspnea.  Ruled out for MI, had
   previously had NSTEMI in setting of cocaine and DKA
   .
   #. Chronic Pain
   -Continue home regimen of oxycodone once blood pressure is stable, and
   mental status clears
   #. Chronic anemia: Baseline 25-30, improved to near baseline with IVF.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, recent right femoral bypass, and cocaine abuse. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T-max 37.4°C, T-current 35.6°C, HR 78 bpm, BP 171/99 mmHg, RR 14 breaths per minute, SpO2 100%.
* Laboratory results:
	+ Blood glucose: 122 mg/dL
	+ Electrolytes: Na 139 mmol/L, K 3.7 mmol/L, Cl 99 mmol/L, HCO3 31 mmol/L
	+ Renal function: Cr 1.0 mg/dL
	+ Liver function: ALT 35 IU/L, AST 24 IU/L, Alk Phos 286 IU/L, T Bili 0.2 mg/dL
	+ Hematology: WBC 12.7 x 10^9/L, Hct 29.8%, Plt 522 x 10^9/L
* Physical examination: Not assessed due to patient's altered mental status.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. DKA: The patient's gap has reopened due to insufficient insulin dosing, and her blood glucose levels are still elevated. She requires restarting insulin gtt and repleting electrolytes as needed.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's Cr level is 1.0 mg/dL, indicating ongoing kidney damage. She requires close monitoring of her renal function and fluid balance.
3. Hypovolemia: The patient's BP is elevated, and her HR is tachycardic, suggesting hypovolemia. She requires fluid resuscitation and monitoring of her hemodynamic status.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of CAD and biventricular systolic dysfunction, which may be exacerbated by her hypovolemia and tachycardia.
5. Anxiety and depression: The patient has a history of anxiety and depression, and she requires continued treatment with home medications such as ativan and clonazepam.
6. Chronic pain: The patient has a history of chronic pain and requires continued treatment with oxycodone once her BP is stable and her mental status clears.
7. Hepatitis B: The patient has a history of hepatitis B, which is currently stable.
8. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient has a history of severe PVD, which may be exacerbated by her recent surgery and DKA.
9. Fever: The patient has a temperature of 37.4°C, which may indicate an underlying infection.

In summary, the patient requires close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination to prevent and manage potential medical complications. She requires continued treatment with insulin, fluids, and medications to manage her DKA, acute renal failure, and other comorbidities."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right femoral
   bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, ARF, and DKA.
   .
   #. DKA: Pt
s gap closed as of yesterday morning. However pt missed AM
   dose of long acting 75/25 (15u), and gap opened up in evening up to 20,
   currently 17.  Overnight BS mostly 100-200, and regular insulin without
   successful closure of gap. Cause of re-opening of gap likely from
   insufficient insulin over the day. [**Month (only) 51**] have other sourse of AG, lactate
   stable. No meds contributing.
   - restarted SQ insulin
   - increased 75/25 20% [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs, so AM is now 18u
   - will check AG again 2pm

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 38-year-old female with type 1 diabetes, severe peripheral vascular disease, and a history of cocaine abuse. She was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

The patient's condition has improved significantly over the past 24 hours. Her abdominal pain has resolved, and she is now hungry. Her blood sugar levels have been controlled, and she is receiving insulin via a continuous infusion and regular injections.

However, there are several potential medical complications that could arise:

1. Hypoglycemia: The patient is at risk of developing hypoglycemia due to the insulin therapy and the potential for insulin resistance.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of cocaine abuse and may be at risk of developing an infection, particularly in the setting of DKA.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease if not properly managed.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of cardiac disease and may be at risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
5. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she may be at risk of developing pulmonary complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, particularly if she develops an infection or experiences respiratory failure.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's gastrointestinal status is stable, but she may be at risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation, particularly if she experiences hypoglycemia or develops an infection.
7. Hematological complications: The patient's hematological status is stable, but she may be at risk of developing hematological complications, such as bleeding or thrombocytopenia, particularly if she experiences hypovolemia or develops an infection.

In conclusion, the patient's condition has improved significantly over the past 24 hours, but she is still at risk of developing various medical complications. Close monitoring and management of her condition are essential to prevent these complications and ensure her safe transition to the floor."
