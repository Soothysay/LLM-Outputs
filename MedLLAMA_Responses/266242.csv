   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 year old male with past medical history of atrial
   fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who has
   been transfered from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of a GI
   bleed.
   .
   #) GI Bleed: At this time appears to be secondary to small bowel source
   as identified on tagged scan at [**Hospital3 4627**], although could also be
   lower GI source as colonoscopy was obscurred by blood. Differential
   includes duodenal ulcer, Meckel's diverticulum, occult malignancy
   (proximal colon), AVM among other possibilities.
   - Maintain IV access, currently has Cordis in place, will check
   position on CXR. Also has two 18 gage PIV's.
   - Will discuss with GI, surgery, and IR best course of management.
   Suspect will likely repeat endoscopy and/or tagged RBC scan.
   Appreciate assistance from GI, surgery, and IR teams. If continues to
   have melena (had one episode on arrival) may need to go directly to
   angio.
   - Type and screen, cross match 4 units
   - Attempting to get copy of tagged RBC scan study from [**Hospital1 872**].
   - IV PPI drip
   - Monitor HCT Q6-8, transfuse for dropping HCT
   .
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation
   for several years. He has not been anticoagulated for a number of years
   due to alcohol abuse and fall risk. Should not currently be
   anti-coagulated due to bleeding. At home takes atenolol, holding at
   present given mild hypotension at OSH.
   - Continue amiodarone drip for now.
   - Holding ASA, other anticoagulation.
   .
   #) Alcohol withdrawal: Patient has been in hospital since [**2197-4-13**], no
   report of alcohol withdrawal symptoms from OSH.
   - CIWA, valium PRN scores >10
   - Folate, thiamine
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion, monitoring
   #) Hypertension: Holding antihypertensives in setting of on-going GIB
   and question of borderline systolic over last day(s).
   - Holding anti-hypertensives today.
   .
   #) History of B12 anemia: Per sign-out from [**Hospital3 4627**], baseline
   HCT is in low 30's.
   - Continue B12 supplementation, transfusion for acute bleeding.
   #) Fevers, leukocytosis: Noted at OSH, will need to follow up final
   urine and blood cultures from [**Hospital3 4627**].
   - Monitor WBC, fever trend, culture should she spike
   #) Tobacco abuse: Nicotine patches.
   .
   #) FEN: NPO at this time given on-going bleeding, if remains NPO for
   extended period, will need to discuss other nutritional support.
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion given history of alcohol use, atrial
   fibrillation, risk of further electrolyte derrangements and
   arrhythmias.
   - IVF for tachycardia, to compensate losses, low urine output.
   .
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - Pneumoboots
   - IV PPI drip
   - No need for VAP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who has been admitted to the ICU for further management of a GI bleed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, and blood pressure of 98/66 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 24.0%
* Platelet count: 140 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 99 mg/dL
* White blood cell count: 6.4 x 10^9/L
* Absolute neutrophil count: 73.5%

The patient's physical examination is limited due to his unstable condition, but he is noted to have a tender abdomen and decreased bowel sounds.

The patient's medications include:

* Amiodarone drip
* Fentanyl
* Midazolam (Versed)
* Diazepam (Valium)
* IV PPI drip
* B12 supplementation
* Folate and thiamine
* Nicotine patches

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Maintaining IV access and checking the position of the Cordis on CXR
* Discussing the best course of management with the GI, surgery, and IR teams
* Suspecting that the patient may need to repeat endoscopy and/or tagged RBC scan
* Transfusing blood products as necessary
* Monitoring the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels
* Holding anticoagulation medications due to the risk of bleeding
* Managing the patient's atrial fibrillation with amiodarone drip
* Withholding anti-hypertensive medications due to the patient's ongoing GI bleed
* Providing aggressive electrolyte repletion and monitoring the patient's electrolyte levels
* Monitoring the patient's WBC and fever trend
* Providing nicotine patches for tobacco abuse

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Continued bleeding from the GI tract
* Development of coagulopathy due to the patient's low platelet count and anticoagulation medications
* Electrolyte imbalances due to the patient's history of alcohol use and atrial fibrillation
* Infection due to the patient's immunosuppressed state and potential bacterial contamination of the GI tract
* Cardiovascular instability due to the patient's atrial fibrillation and hypotension
* Respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying lung disease and potential aspiration of gastric contents
* Sepsis due to the patient's suspected GI tract infection and potential bacteremia."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 year old male with past medical history of atrial
   fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who has
   been transfered from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of a GI
   bleed.
   .
   #) GI Bleed: At this time appears to be secondary to small bowel source
   as identified on tagged scan at [**Hospital3 4627**], although could also be
   lower GI source as colonoscopy was obscurred by blood. Differential
   includes duodenal ulcer, Meckel's diverticulum, occult malignancy
   (proximal colon), AVM among other possibilities.
   - Maintain IV access
 will get another 16g, and take out cordis
   - Will discuss with GI, surgery, and IR best course of management.
   - Will likely pursue  tagged RBC scan.
   - change to IV BID ppi
   - moniter hct q8
   .
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation
   for several years. He has not been anticoagulated for a number of years
   due to alcohol abuse and fall risk. Should not currently be
   anti-coagulated due to bleeding. At home takes atenolol, holding at
   present given mild hypotension at OSH.
   - d/c amiodarone
   - Holding ASA, other anticoagulation.
   - metoprol as needed
   .
   #) Alcohol withdrawal: Patient has been in hospital since [**2197-4-13**], no
   report of alcohol withdrawal symptoms from OSH.
   - CIWA, valium PRN scores >10
   - Folate, thiamine
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion, monitoring
   #) Hypertension: Holding antihypertensives in setting of on-going GIB
   and question of borderline systolic over last day(s).
   - Holding anti-hypertensives today.
   .
   #) History of B12 anemia: Per sign-out from [**Hospital3 4627**], baseline
   HCT is in low 30's.
   - Continue B12 supplementation, transfusion for acute bleeding.
   #) Fevers, leukocytosis: Noted at OSH, will need to follow up final
   urine and blood cultures from [**Hospital3 4627**].
   - Monitor WBC, fever trend, culture should she spike
   #) Tobacco abuse: Nicotine patches.
   .
   #) FEN: NPO at this time given on-going bleeding, if remains NPO for
   extended period, will need to discuss other nutritional support.
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion given history of alcohol use, atrial
   fibrillation, risk of further electrolyte derrangements and
   arrhythmias.
   - IVF for tachycardia, to compensate losses, low urine output.
   - checking ionized Ca
   .
   #) Prophylaxis:
   - Pneumoboots
   - No need for VAP
   #) Code: Full
   #) Emergency Contact: [**Name (NI) **] would not provide any family or friend
   contacts in event of emergency.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who was transferred to the ICU for further management of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has a history of bleeding from the small bowel, but the exact source is unclear. He is currently being managed with IV access, IV fluids, and medications to control his bleeding and atrial fibrillation. The patient is also being monitored for signs of alcohol withdrawal and has a history of B12 anemia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's GI bleed is ongoing, and there is a risk of further bleeding, particularly if the source is not identified and treated.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with medications, but there is a risk of further complications, such as stroke or heart failure.
3. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is at risk of developing alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which can lead to seizures, hallucinations, and other complications.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is being monitored, but there is a risk of further hypertension-related complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
5. B12 anemia: The patient has a history of B12 anemia, which can lead to fatigue, weakness, and other complications if left untreated.
6. Infection: The patient has a risk of developing infections, particularly if his GI bleed is not treated promptly and effectively.
7. Malnutrition: The patient is currently NPO, which increases his risk of malnutrition and related complications, such as weakness, fatigue, and decreased immune function.
8. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has a history of electrolyte imbalances, particularly with regards to potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus, which can lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other complications if not managed promptly and effectively.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and hypertension increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke.
10. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is being monitored, but there is a risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, if he develops a respiratory infection or if his respiratory function deteriorates."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 year old male with past medical history of atrial
   fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who has
   been transfered from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of a GI
   bleed.
   .
   #) GI Bleed: At this time appears to be secondary to small bowel source
   as identified on tagged scan at [**Hospital3 4627**], although could also be
   lower GI source as colonoscopy was obscurred by blood. Differential
   includes duodenal ulcer, Meckel's diverticulum, occult malignancy
   (proximal colon), AVM among other possibilities.
   - Maintain IV access
 will get another 16g, and take out cordis
   - Will discuss with GI, surgery, and IR best course of management.
   - Will likely pursue  tagged RBC scan.
   - change to IV BID ppi
   - moniter hct q8
   .
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation
   for several years. He has not been anticoagulated for a number of years
   due to alcohol abuse and fall risk. Should not currently be
   anti-coagulated due to bleeding. At home takes atenolol, holding at
   present given mild hypotension at OSH.
   - d/c amiodarone
   - Holding ASA, other anticoagulation.
   - metoprol as needed
   .
   #) Alcohol withdrawal: Patient has been in hospital since [**2197-4-13**], no
   report of alcohol withdrawal symptoms from OSH.
   - CIWA, valium PRN scores >10
   - Folate, thiamine
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion, monitoring
   #) Hypertension: Holding antihypertensives in setting of on-going GIB
   and question of borderline systolic over last day(s).
   - Holding anti-hypertensives today.
   .
   #) History of B12 anemia: Per sign-out from [**Hospital3 4627**], baseline
   HCT is in low 30's.
   - Continue B12 supplementation, transfusion for acute bleeding.
   #) Fevers, leukocytosis: Noted at OSH, will need to follow up final
   urine and blood cultures from [**Hospital3 4627**].
   - Monitor WBC, fever trend, culture should she spike
   #) Tobacco abuse: Nicotine patches.
   .
   #) FEN: NPO at this time given on-going bleeding, if remains NPO for
   extended period, will need to discuss other nutritional support.
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion given history of alcohol use, atrial
   fibrillation, risk of further electrolyte derrangements and
   arrhythmias.
   - IVF for tachycardia, to compensate losses, low urine output.
   - checking ionized Ca
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 62-year-old male who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for further management of a GI bleed. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. The patient's current condition includes:

* Atrial fibrillation with a history of not being anticoagulated due to alcohol abuse and fall risk
* GI bleed with a suspected small bowel source, but could also be a lower GI source
* Hypertension, currently holding antihypertensives
* History of B12 anemia, currently receiving supplementation and transfusions
* Leukocytosis and fever, with pending urine and blood cultures
* Tobacco abuse, currently receiving nicotine patches
* FEN (fetal electroencephalogram) is NPO at this time due to ongoing bleeding
* Aggressive electrolyte repletion is being done due to history of alcohol use and atrial fibrillation

The patient's vital signs are:

* Tmax: 36.8°C (98.3°F)
* Tcurrent: 36.3°C (97.3°F)
* HR: 93 bpm (93-127 bpm)
* BP: 98/66 mmHg (74/55-126/105 mmHg)
* RR: 23 inspirations per minute (11-28 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 98%

The patient's lab results show:

* WBC: 6.4-6.9 K/uL
* Hct: 24.0-25.0%
* Plt: 140-141 K/uL
* Cr: 0.7-0.8 mg/dL
* Glucose: 99-109 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.3/27.6/1.1, ALT/AST: 17/23, Alk Phos/T Bili: 35/0.8, Differential-Neuts: 73.5%, Lymph: 15.6%, Mono: 7.1%, Eos: 3.5%, Albumin: 2.5 g/dL, LDH: 127 IU/L, Ca++: 7.5 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.6 mg/dL, PO4: 3.4 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Further bleeding due to GI bleed
* Development of atrial fibrillation-related complications such as stroke or systemic embolism
* Worsening of hypertension
* Development of electrolyte imbalances due to aggressive electrolyte repletion
* Infection due to pending urine and blood cultures
* Complications related to nicotine patches
* Nutritional deficiencies due to FEN being NPO

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Maintaining IV access and taking out the cordis
* Discussing best course of management with GI, surgery, and IR
* Pursuing tagged RBC scan
* Changing to IV BID ppi
* Monitoring Hct q8
* Discontinuing amiodarone
* Holding ASA and other anticoagulation
* Using metoprolol as needed
* Continuing B12 supplementation and transfusions
* Monitoring WBC and fever trend
* Discussing other nutritional support if FEN remains NPO for an extended period
* Aggressive electrolyte repletion
* IVF for tachycardia and to compensate losses
* Checking ionized Ca
* Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 year old male with past medical history of atrial
   fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who has
   been transfered from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of a GI
   bleed.
   .
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB): At this time appears
   to be secondary to small bowel source as identified on tagged scan at
   [**Hospital3 4627**], although could also be lower GI source as colonoscopy
   was obscurred by blood. Differential includes duodenal ulcer, Meckel's
   diverticulum, occult malignancy (proximal colon), AVM among other
   possibilities.
   - s/p colonoscopy this AM
   - IV BID ppi
   - moniter hct q8, has active T+C, 3PIVs
   .
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Patient has a history of atrial
   fibrillation for several years. He has not been anticoagulated for a
   number of years due to alcohol abuse and fall risk. Should not
   currently be anti-coagulated due to bleeding. At home takes atenolol,
   holding at present given mild hypotension at OSH.
   - d/c amiodarone given poor likelihood of followup
   - Holding ASA, other anticoagulation.
   - metoprol as needed
   .
   #
 .H/O ALCOHOL ABUSE: Patient has been in hospital since [**2197-4-13**], no
   report of alcohol withdrawal symptoms from OSH.
   - not requiring CIWA
   - Folate, thiamine
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion, monitoring
   #) Hypertension: Holding antihypertensives in setting of on-going GIB
   and question of borderline systolic over last day(s).
   - Can restart as tolerates

Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. He was transferred from another hospital for further management of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 119 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 96/70 mmHg. He is tachycardic and has an irregular heart rhythm due to atrial fibrillation. His oxygen saturation is 99%.

The patient's physical examination reveals pale conjunctiva, slightly dry mouth, and poor dentition. He has a supple neck and clear lungs. His abdomen is soft, and he has no evidence of bleeding or tenderness.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 25.2%, and platelet count of 140,000/μL. His liver enzymes are mildly elevated, and his electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has not been anticoagulated due to his alcohol abuse and fall risk. He is currently not receiving anticoagulation therapy due to his bleeding.

The patient's gastrointestinal bleed is likely secondary to a small bowel source, although a lower GI source is also possible. The differential diagnosis includes duodenal ulcer, Meckel's diverticulum, occult malignancy, and arteriovenous malformation.

The patient's medications include pantoprazole, diazepam, and metoprolol. He is also receiving thiamine, folate, and nicotine patches.

The patient's plan of care includes colonoscopy to further evaluate the source of the bleeding, IV proton pump inhibitors to reduce acid production, and monitoring of his hemoglobin level. He is also receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Further bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleed is a significant risk factor for further bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure.
2. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and ongoing bleeding make him susceptible to infection, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and ongoing bleeding increase his risk of developing further arrhythmias, which could lead to cardiac arrest.
4. Liver damage: The patient's elevated liver enzymes suggest potential liver damage, which could lead to liver failure and death.
5. Kidney damage: The patient's ongoing bleeding and compromised circulation increase his risk of developing acute kidney injury, which could lead to chronic kidney disease and death.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and hypoxia increase his risk of developing respiratory failure, which could lead to death.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension increase his risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiac arrest.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications and improve his outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 62 year old male with past medical history of atrial
   fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who has
   been transfered from [**Hospital3 **] for further management of a GI
   bleed.
   .
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB): At this time appears
   to be secondary to small bowel source as identified on tagged scan at
   [**Hospital3 4627**], although could also be lower GI source as colonoscopy
   was obscurred by blood. Differential includes duodenal ulcer, Meckel's
   diverticulum, occult malignancy (proximal colon), AVM among other
   possibilities.
   - Maintain IV access
 will get another 16g, and take out cordis
   - Will discuss with GI, surgery, and IR best course of management.
   - Will likely pursue  tagged RBC scan.
   - change to IV BID ppi
   - moniter hct q8
   .
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB): Patient has a history of atrial
   fibrillation for several years. He has not been anticoagulated for a
   number of years due to alcohol abuse and fall risk. Should not
   currently be anti-coagulated due to bleeding. At home takes atenolol,
   holding at present given mild hypotension at OSH.
   - d/c amiodarone
   - Holding ASA, other anticoagulation.
   - metoprol as needed
   .
   #
 .H/O ALCOHOL ABUSE: Patient has been in hospital since [**2197-4-13**], no
   report of alcohol withdrawal symptoms from OSH.
   - CIWA, valium PRN scores >10
   - Folate, thiamine
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion, monitoring
   #) Hypertension: Holding antihypertensives in setting of on-going GIB
   and question of borderline systolic over last day(s).
   - Holding anti-hypertensives today.
   .
   #) History of B12 anemia: Per sign-out from [**Hospital3 4627**], baseline
   HCT is in low 30's.
   - Continue B12 supplementation, transfusion for acute bleeding.
   #) Fevers, leukocytosis: Noted at OSH, will need to follow up final
   urine and blood cultures from [**Hospital3 4627**].
   - Monitor WBC, fever trend, culture should she spike
   #) Tobacco abuse: Nicotine patches.
   .
   #) FEN: NPO at this time given on-going bleeding, if remains NPO for
   extended period, will need to discuss other nutritional support.
   - Aggressive electrolyte repletion given history of alcohol use, atrial
   fibrillation, risk of further electrolyte derrangements and
   arrhythmias.
   - IVF for tachycardia, to compensate losses, low urine output.
   - checking ionized Ca

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation, alcohol abuse, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, who has been transferred from another hospital for further management of a gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T (98.9°C), HR (119 bpm), BP (96/70 mmHg), RR (18 inspirations per minute), SpO2 (99%)
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has a total fluid balance of -1737 mL, with a net loss of 568 mL over the past 24 hours.
* Laboratory results: The patient's Hct has decreased from 28.2% to 25.2% over the past 24 hours. Other lab results include:
	+ WBC: 6.4-6.9 K/μL
	+ Hct: 24.0-28.2%
	+ Plt: 140-205 K/μL
	+ Cr: 0.7-0.8 mg/dL
	+ Glucose: 94-109 mg/dL
	+ Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 13.3/27.6/1.1, ALT/AST: 17/23, Alk Phos/T Bili: 35/0.8, Differential-Neuts: 73.5%, Lymph: 15.6%, Mono: 7.1%, Eos: 3.5%, Albumin: 2.5 g/dL, LDH: 127 IU/L, Ca++: 7.3 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.6 mg/dL, PO4: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: NAD, coughing
* HEENT: Pale conjunctiva, no scleral icterus. Slightly dry MM. Poor dentition. No oral lesions noted.
* Neck: Supple. Flat JVP.
* Lungs: Clear, no wheezes/rhonchi/rales.
* Cardiac: Irregular, tachycardic, no rubs/murmurs/gallops
* Abd: Soft, NT, ND, +BS
* Extr: Warm, no edema, dried blood over hands. No cyanosis or clubbing.
* Radial/PT/DP: 2+ bilaterally.
* Neuro: Alert, oriented to person, place, month. Tangential discussion, but fluent speech. Moving all extremities without difficulty.
* Psych: Slightly agitated, tangential speech.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the source is suspected to be small bowel or lower GI. The patient will undergo a tagged RBC scan to determine the source of the bleeding.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not currently anticoagulated due to bleeding. The patient will be monitored for signs of bleeding or stroke.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is being closely monitored due to concerns about bleeding.
* History of B12 anemia: The patient has a history of B12 anemia, and the patient will continue to receive B12 supplementation and transfusions as needed.
* Fevers, leukocytosis: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, and the patient will need to follow up with final urine and blood cultures from the previous hospital.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and the patient may continue to bleed due to the underlying condition or complications such as anemia or thrombocytopenia.
* Infection: The patient has a fever and leukocytosis, which may indicate an underlying infection. The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of infection, such as worsening fever, chills, or increased white blood cell count.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and atrial fibrillation, which may increase the risk of electrolyte imbalances. The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of electrolyte imbalance, such as muscle weakness, confusion, or changes in heart rhythm.
* Thromboembolism: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which may increase the risk of thromboembolism. The patient will need to be closely monitored for signs of thromboembolism, such as sudden onset of shortness of breath, chest pain, or leg swelling.
* Worsening anemia: The patient has a history of B12 anemia, and the patient may continue to experience worsening anemia due to ongoing bleeding or other underlying conditions."
