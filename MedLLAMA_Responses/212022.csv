   Assessment and Plan
   61F w/ ongoing Crohn's flare refractory to steroids, undergoing Humira
   induction, with RUE DVT and persistent bloody diarrhea draining through
   rectovaginal fistula, EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] w/ TI disease w/o source of GIB,
   bleeding scan pos at ileo-cecal area but angio procedure negative with
   repeat c-scope which did not show any active sites of bleeding
   # Acute blood loss anemiaCrohn's disease wtih intermittant
   melena/hematochezia.  EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] unrevealing, tagged red scan positive
   for bleed at ileo-cecal junction but angiogram negative for active
   bleed.
   - repeated c-scope on [**3-24**] without any active source of bleeding
   found.  no melena since procedure.  Gi recommended sending the stools
   for mycobacteria as that can cause diarrhea/melena
   - Q6 HCT drawn; slowly trending down still.  Patient is still
   hemodynamically stable, actually is hypertensive despite slow HCT drop
   - cont Q6 HCT check for now; d/w GI whether any other studies
   necessary; seems to be a fairly slow bleed.  may need capsule study to
   evaluate for small bowel AVMs or other source of bleeding
   - Will transfuse to a goal of >28 or HD instability
   # Crohn's disease: Patient is currently on Solumedrol 20 IV Q8H
   - not getting any PO meds right now; may consider restarting POs today-
   since likely no other imaging studies right now.
   - given a dose of MTX yesterday per GI.  Also recently started on
   Humira- got 2 doses.
   - Continue TPN given short gut
   # DVT: Patient found to have RUE clot at the site of her prior PICC
   line. Unable to anticoagulate patient at this time given her active GI
   bleed.
   - Heat packs to site, elevation of arm
   - Continue to monitor
   - Will discuss anticoagulation after resolution of bleed, though this
   will likely be an ongoing problem for the patient given her severe IBD.
   # Hypothyroidism: Patient is on levothyroxine 112mcg daily as an
   outpatient.
   - on IV levothyroxine until able to take POs.  will change once
   tolerating POs
   # Hypertension: On Moexipril and Atenolol as outpatient. Will hold
   anti-hypertensives for now in the setting of large GI bleed. Continues
   to be very hypertensive
   - titrated up on Hydral to 30 mg IV Q6H with prn labetaolol IV
   - will restart PO medications this AM- atenolol and moexipril
   # Osteoporosis: On Alendronate q Sunday and vitamin D/Calcium
   supplementation.
   - Continue outpatient regimen
   # Access: Currently has left sided PICC in place with dual lumen.
   # FEN: Patient is on TPN as an outpatient due to her malnutrition.
   - Continue TPN as per nutrition recs
   - Clear liquid diet
   - ISS given TPN and steroids
   - Follow amylase, lipase and LFTs on TPN
   # PPX: Pneumoboots, no heparin given GI bleed, not on ppi as outpatient
   but given duodenitis on EGD, will start protonix q24H

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, anemia, and melena. She underwent a colonoscopy, which showed ulcers consistent with Crohn's disease, but no active sites of bleeding. She was started on ciprofloxacin, flagyl, and methotrexate, and her blood pressure was controlled with hydralazine. She has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is being treated with heat packs and elevation of the arm.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 189/71 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 11 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 95%. She is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and is being monitored for signs of hypothyroidism, hypertension, and osteoporosis.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL and a hematocrit of 35.8%. Her white blood cell count is 14.1 x 10^9/L, and her platelet count is 90 x 10^9/L. Her liver function tests are normal, and her electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:

1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of melena and hematochezia, and her colonoscopy showed ulcers consistent with Crohn's disease. She is at risk for further bleeding, especially with her anemia and low platelet count.
2. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient has a right upper extremity DVT, which may lead to pulmonary embolism if left untreated. She is being treated with heat packs and elevation of the arm, but anticoagulation therapy may be necessary once her bleeding has resolved.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient is on levothyroxine therapy, but her thyroid function should be monitored regularly to ensure that her hypothyroidism is well-controlled.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is being controlled with hydralazine, but she may require further medication to control her hypertension once her bleeding has resolved.
5. Osteoporosis: The patient is at risk for osteoporosis due to her Crohn's disease and malnutrition. She should be monitored regularly for signs of osteoporosis, and may require treatment with bisphosphonates or other medications.
6. Malnutrition: The patient is malnourished due to her Crohn's disease and lack of oral intake. She should be monitored regularly for signs of malnutrition, and may require nutritional support with TPN or other medications."

   melena/hematochezia.  EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] unrevealing, tagged red scan positive
   for bleed at ileo-cecal junction but angiogram negative for active
   bleed.
   - repeated c-scope on [**3-24**] without any active source of bleeding
   found.  no melena since procedure.  Gi recommended sending the stools
   for mycobacteria as that can cause diarrhea/melena
   - Q6 HCT drawn; slowly trending down still.  Patient is still
   hemodynamically stable, actually is hypertensive despite slow HCT drop
   - repeat HCT this PM; d/w GI whether any other studies necessary; seems
   to be a fairly slow bleed.  may need capsule study to evaluate for
   small bowel AVMs or other source of bleeding
   - Will transfuse to a goal of >28 or HD instability
   # Crohn's disease: Patient is currently on Solumedrol 20 IV Q8H
   - not getting any PO meds right now; may consider restarting POs today-
   since likely no other imaging studies right now.
   - given a dose of MTX yesterday per GI.  Also recently started on
   Humira- got 2 doses.
   - Continue TPN given short gut
   # DVT: Patient found to have RUE clot at the site of her prior PICC
   line. Unable to anticoagulate patient at this time given her active GI
   bleed.
   - Heat packs to site, elevation of arm
   - Continue to monitor
   - Will discuss anticoagulation after resolution of bleed, though this
   will likely be an ongoing problem for the patient given her severe IBD.
   # Hypothyroidism: Patient is on levothyroxine 112mcg daily as an

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of Crohn's disease, anemia, and melena. She underwent a colonoscopy and was found to have ulcers consistent with Crohn's disease, but no active sites of bleeding. She was started on ciprofloxacin, flagyl, and methotrexate per GI. She has been experiencing hypertension, with a systolic blood pressure ranging from 150-190 mmHg, and has been treated with hydralazine and labetalol. She has also been experiencing bloody diarrhea, which has been managed with TPN and stool studies.

The patient has a history of DVT and is currently experiencing a RUE clot at the site of her prior PICC line. She is unable to anticoagulate due to her active GI bleed. She is also experiencing hypothyroidism and hypertension, and is taking medications for these conditions.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL. Her white blood cell count is 14.1 K/uL, and her platelet count is 90 K/uL. Her liver enzymes are mildly elevated, and her renal function is normal.

Potential medical complications:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's ongoing bleeding is a significant risk factor for further complications, including hypovolemic shock, renal failure, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and ongoing GI bleeding increase her risk of developing infections, including sepsis and pneumonia.
3. Thrombosis: The patient's history of DVT and current RUE clot at the site of her prior PICC line increase her risk of developing further thrombotic events, including pulmonary embolism and stroke.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen her anemia and fatigue, and may also increase her risk of developing other complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and depression.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen her cardiovascular risk, including increasing her risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke.
6. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis may worsen her risk of developing fractures, particularly in the setting of malnutrition and immobility.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's malnutrition may worsen her anemia, fatigue, and overall health, and may also increase her risk of developing other complications, such as infections and thrombosis."

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo female admit with ""blood diarrhea"" in the setting of difficult to
   control Crohn's disease.  She has had continued bleeding with
   evaluation showing source at IC junction with bleeding scan but
   negative angio and colonscopy to try to identify treatable new acute
   source of bleeding.  She has had diffuse ulcerative disease as perhaps
   most likely explanation--encouraging is the she has had no further
   acute bleeding but does retain continued slow blood loss.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of GI bleed, specifically blood diarrhea, in the setting of difficult-to-control Crohn's disease. The patient has undergone a colonoscopy, and the source of bleeding has been identified as the IC junction. The patient has received 4 units of PRBC prior to transfer to the ICU and has not received any further transfusions since admission.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 78 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 155/65 mmHg. The patient's respiratory support is minimal, with an oxygen saturation of 95% and an ABG result of 23.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a thin general appearance, with normal head, ears, nose, and throat findings. The patient's cardiovascular examination is normal, with no murmurs or bruits. The patient's abdominal examination is soft and bowel sounds are present.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 13.0 g/dL, white blood cell count of 14.1 K/uL, and platelet count of 90 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are normal, with a sodium level of 139 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.8 mEq/L, and chloride level of 35.8 mmol/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for Crohn's disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and DVT. The patient is currently receiving treatment for her Crohn's disease, including Solumedrol, MTX, and fumaric acid, as well as prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's GI bleed has not resolved, and further bleeding can occur, potentially leading to hypovolemic shock or anemia.
2. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to Crohn's disease and treatment with immunosuppressive medications increases the risk of infection.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if not adequately managed, potentially leading to fatigue, cold intolerance, and weight gain.
4. DVT: The patient's history of DVT and current PICC line placement increases the risk of recurrent DVT or pulmonary embolism.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen if not adequately managed, potentially leading to cardiovascular complications.
6. GI perforation: The patient's Crohn's disease and ongoing bleeding increase the risk of GI perforation, potentially leading to peritonitis and sepsis.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her Crohn's disease, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and DVT, as well as continued treatment for her GI bleed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with ongoing Crohn's disease, refractory to steroids, undergoing Humira induction. She has a history of RUE DVT, persistent bloody diarrhea, and a rectovaginal fistula. She has been experiencing acute blood loss anemia with intermittent melena/hematochezia. Recent imaging studies, including EGD and angiogram, have not revealed an active source of bleeding. The patient's hematocrit has been trending down, with a current level of 35.5%. She is being treated with TPN, steroids, and antihypertensives.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's ongoing bleeding and low hematocrit level pose a risk of further bleeding complications, including hypovolemic shock and cardiac instability.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to Crohn's disease and treatment with immunosuppressive agents increases her risk of infection.
3. Thrombosis: The patient's history of DVT and the presence of a PICC line increase her risk of thrombotic complications.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism and the need for levothyroxine supplementation require close monitoring to ensure adequate thyroid hormone replacement.
5. Osteoporosis: The patient's history of osteoporosis and the need for Alendronate and vitamin D/Calcium supplementation require close monitoring to ensure adequate bone density and prevention of osteoporotic fractures.
6. Hypertension: The patient's persistent hypertension despite antihypertensive treatment poses a risk of cardiovascular complications, including cardiac failure and stroke.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's short gut syndrome and need for TPN may lead to nutritional deficiencies, including protein-energy malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of Crohn's disease and rectovaginal fistula increase her risk of gastrointestinal complications, including perforation and abscess formation.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions to prevent complications and ensure optimal outcomes."

   61F w/ ongoing Crohn's flare refractory to steroids, undergoing Humira
   induction, with RUE DVT and persistent bloody diarrhea draining through
   rectovaginal fistula, EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] w/ TI disease w/o source of GIB,
   bleeding scan pos at ileo-cecal area but angio procedure negative with
   repeat c-scope which did not show any active sites of bleeding
   # Acute blood loss anemia: Crohn's disease wtih intermittant
   melena/hematochezia.  EGD/[**Last Name (un) **] unrevealing, tagged red scan positive
   for bleed at ileo-cecal junction but angiogram negative for active
   bleed.
   - Repeated c-scope on [**3-24**] without any active source of bleeding
   found.  No melena since procedure.  Gi recommended sending the stools
   for mycobacteria as that can cause diarrhea/melena
   - Q6 HCT drawn; stable at this time.  Patient is still hemodynamically
   stable, actually is hypertensive despite slow HCT drop
   - Repeat HCT this PM; d/w GI whether any other studies necessary; seems
   to be a fairly slow bleed.  may need capsule study to evaluate for
   small bowel AVMs or other source of bleeding
   - Will transfuse to a goal of >28 or HD instability
   # Crohn's disease: Patient is currently on Solumedrol 20 IV Q8H. No
   further imaging studies for now per GI.
   - Patient restarted on home PO meds including supplements.
   - Given a dose of MTX per GI.  Also recently started on Humira- got 2
   doses.
   - Continue TPN given short gut
   # DVT: Patient found to have RUE clot at the site of her prior PICC
   line. Unable to anticoagulate patient at this time given her active GI
   bleed.
   - Heat packs to site, elevation of arm
   - Continue to monitor
   - Will discuss anticoagulation after resolution of bleed, though this
   will likely be an ongoing problem for the patient given her severe IBD.
   # Hypothyroidism: Patient is on levothyroxine 112mcg daily as an
   outpatient.
   - Restarted on PO levothyroxine yesterday as patient is tolerating POs.
   # Hypertension: On Moexipril and Atenolol as outpatient.  Were holding
   anti-hypertensives in the setting of large GI bleed. Restarted
   antihypertensives yesterday morning as patient was persistently
   hypertensive.
   - Continue to monitor BP
   - Can uptitrate PO meds today if necessary
   # Osteoporosis: On Alendronate q Sunday and vitamin D/Calcium
   supplementation.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with refractory Crohn's disease who presented with acute blood loss anemia due to a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She has a history of Crohn's disease, right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and rectovaginal fistula. She has undergone Humira induction and has been receiving treatment with Solumedrol, mesalamine, and metronidazole. Despite restarting antihypertensive medications, her blood pressure remains persistently hypertensive. Her hemoglobin level continues to trend downward, and she has been transfused with blood products. She is currently receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has been restarted on her home medications, including supplements.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued bleeding: The patient's GI bleed may continue, leading to further blood loss and anemia.
2. Hypovolemic shock: The patient's ongoing bleeding and blood loss may lead to hypovolemic shock, which can be life-threatening.
3. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and presence of a rectovaginal fistula increase her risk of infection.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's ongoing bleeding and blood loss may lead to thrombocytopenia, which can increase her risk of bleeding complications.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen due to her ongoing illness and treatment.
6. Osteoporosis: The patient's osteoporosis may worsen due to her ongoing illness and treatment.
7. Hypertension: The patient's persistent hypertension may lead to complications such as heart failure, kidney disease, and stroke.
8. DVT: The patient's existing DVT may worsen or extend to other areas of her body, leading to further complications.
9. Malnutrition: The patient's ongoing illness and treatment may lead to malnutrition, which can worsen her overall health and increase her risk of complications."
