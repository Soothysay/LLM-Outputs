   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  71 yo F w/ remote breast ca s/p mastectomy
   and chemo and recent dx of esoph SCca with TE fistula s/p esophageal
   and bronchus Y stent 2 wks ago.  Admitted [**8-20**] for palliative chemo and
   transferred to ICU yesterday w/ resp distress (desat to 75%, BP
   stable but tachy to 160, refusing sx) for emergent bronch to eval stent
   patency. She remains comfortable from resp standpoint since her
   bronchoscopy. She has had transient agitation/confusion overnight.

   Her respiratory distress was most likely from plugging and has resolved
   post-bronch. Agree with plan to continue chest PT, pulm toilet, nebs
   with bronchodilators and mucolytics.  IP service is following. Continue
   moxiflox through [**8-23**] for prophylaxis after stent placement.  She
   continues to have a leukocytosos but remains af w/o obvious infectious
   etiology. Will f/u on pending cx's.  She remains tachycardic, near her
   baseline. Hypovolemia and possibly pain are likely factors. Continue
   gentle fluids and resume TFs.  Her agitation and confusion is better.
   If [**Name (NI) 4467**], would use haldol rather than benzos.  Additional onc
   recs regarding her plan for pallitaitve chemo/c/s rad onc. Zofran for
   nausea.  Will restart fent patch and half dose methadone for chronic
   pain.  ICU:  R portacath, sq hep, PPI, full code, which will continue
   to be addressed with onc team.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

* The patient is a 71-year-old female with a history of esophageal cancer, who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and was transferred from the NEB unit.
* The patient has a Y-stent in place and was found to have acute hypoxia, concerning for mucus plugging or malfunction of the Y-stent.
* The patient has leukocytosis, but is afebrile, and the differential diagnosis includes reactive leukocytosis from aspiration pneumonitis.
* The patient has been experiencing agitation, which is suspected to be medication-induced, and has been treated with Haldol and re-started on her home dose of methadone.
* The patient has tachycardia, which is likely due to agitation, respiratory distress, and hypovolemia.
* The patient has been treated with antibiotics, including Moxifloxacin, and has been prescribed pain medication, including fentanyl patches and methadone.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure, which is already present, and may worsen if the patient's respiratory distress is not adequately managed.
* Sepsis, which is a possibility given the patient's leukocytosis and recent antibiotic use.
* Infection, which could be caused by the patient's underlying cancer, or by a secondary infection such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
* Hypovolemia, which could worsen the patient's tachycardia and other cardiovascular symptoms.
* Pain, which could worsen the patient's agitation and other symptoms.
* Nausea and vomiting, which could worsen the patient's respiratory distress and other symptoms.

The patient's plan includes continuing chest physical therapy, pulmonary toilet, and nebulizer treatments with bronchodilators and mucolytics, as well as restarting tube feeds and re-starting her home dose of methadone and fentanyl patches. The patient will also be followed up with her oncologist and radiologist to discuss her plan for palliative chemotherapy and radiation therapy."

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old female with esophageal cancer, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and emergent bronchoscopy. She has a history of chronic pain, nausea, and vomiting, and is currently experiencing agitation, tachycardia, and leukocytosis. She has been prescribed various medications, including opioids, benzodiazepines, and antiemetics, and is being treated for respiratory failure, acute pain, and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to further hypoxia and potential respiratory arrest.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may be a sign of infection or inflammation. If left untreated, this could lead to sepsis or other complications.
3. Agitation: The patient's agitation may worsen, leading to increased stress, anxiety, and potential harm to herself or others.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may worsen, leading to cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiovascular complications.
5. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may persist, leading to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potential gastrointestinal complications.
6. Pain management: The patient's pain management plan may be inadequate, leading to increased pain, discomfort, and potential complications.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may not be properly managed, leading to potential complications such as decreased cognitive function, fatigue, and depression.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old white female with esophageal cancer, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and emergent bronchoscopy. The patient has been experiencing acute hypoxia, and the possibility of mucus plugging, Y-stent malposition or obstruction, PE, pneumonia, or PTX has been considered.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 97.9°C, heart rate of 124 bpm, and blood pressure of 145/92 mmHg. The patient is tachycardic, but the ECG is not available in the record.

The patient has a history of leukocytosis, which is being monitored, and the possibility of reactive leukocytosis from aspiration pneumonitis has been considered. The patient was previously on Moxifloxacin and will complete the 2-week course. The patient's WBC count is trending, and BCx, UA/UCx will be followed.

The patient is experiencing agitation, which may be medication-induced, and has received Haldol and re-started Fentanyl patch and home methadone dose. The patient's pain control is being managed with IV fluids, and the regimen will be added back after bronchoscopy and stabilization.

The patient has a history of nausea and vomiting, but is not currently experiencing symptoms. The patient's thyroid hormone replacement therapy is being continued, and the patient's hypertension is being managed with home dose Procardia.

The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen, and the possibility of intubation has been considered. The patient's ICU care includes tube feeds to be re-started today, and glycemic control is being monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute hypoxia and respiratory distress can lead to respiratory failure if not managed promptly.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis can lead to infection, sepsis, or other complications if not managed properly.
3. Agitation: The patient's agitation can lead to further complications, such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, if not managed with sedation and analgesia.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia can lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest, if not managed properly.
5. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and other complications if not managed with antiemetic medications and fluids.
6. Pain management: The patient's pain management is critical, and inadequate management can lead to further complications, such as respiratory depression or cardiac complications.
7. Infection: The patient's history of leukocytosis and respiratory distress increases the risk of infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ failure, or death if not managed promptly.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of nausea and vomiting increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as bleeding or perforation, if not managed properly.

In conclusion, the patient is at risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are essential to prevent these complications and ensure the patient's safe and effective care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old white female with esophageal cancer, admitted to the hospital for respiratory distress and emergent bronchoscopy. She has a history of chronic pain, nausea/vomiting, and hypertension. She was transferred to the ICU for acute hypoxia, upper airway obstruction, and respiratory failure.

The patient received 2g of Haldol and 3mg of morphine overnight due to agitation. She has a fever of 36.6°C, tachycardia, and respiratory distress. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 135 bpm, blood pressure of 169/98 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient has a history of allergies to codeine, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, erythromycin base, and penicillins. She is currently receiving midazolam, fentanyl, and haloperidol.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.0 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 36.1%, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 587 K/uL. Her creatinine level is 0.4 mg/dL, and her glucose level is 162 mg/dL.

The patient's plan includes:

* Respiratory distress: emergent bronchoscopy, continuous nebs (albuterol, ipratropium, mucomyst), and close monitoring of respiratory status
* Leukocytosis: continue Moxifloxacin for 3 more days, trend WBC, and send blood and urine cultures
* Agitation: hold on ativan, use haldol 0.25 prn for agitation
* Tachycardia: consider ECG, IV fluids, and gentle 250cc NS bolus
* Esophageal CA: follow-up with oncologist for chemotherapy and XRT
* Nausea/vomiting: antiemetics including reglan, zofran, and IV PPI
* Pain management: restart methadone, fentanyl patches, and dilaudid prn
* HTN: continue home dose of procardia
* Hypothyroidism: continue home dose of synthroid

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: worsening respiratory distress, need for mechanical ventilation
* Leukocytosis: development of infection, sepsis
* Agitation: worsening agitation, need for sedation
* Tachycardia: development of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure
* Esophageal CA: worsening tumor growth, development of fistula
* Nausea/vomiting: worsening nausea and vomiting, dehydration
* Pain management: inadequate pain control, worsening pain
* HTN: worsening hypertension, development of cardiac complications
* Hypothyroidism: worsening hypothyroidism, development of myxedema coma"

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, leukocytosis, pain control, and tachycardia. The patient has a history of nausea and vomiting, and has received several medications to manage these symptoms, including zofran, reglan, dilaudid, and haldol.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure of 160/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving nasal cannula oxygen and has an arterial blood gas reading of pH 7.28, pCO2 28 mmHg, and pO2 102 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 17.0 K/uL, and thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 505 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a protrusion of the tongue during administration of reglan, which was likely a dystonic reaction. The patient's respiratory examination is notable for bilateral wheezing, and the patient's cardiovascular examination is notable for a rapid heart rate.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely related to their underlying disease process, and may worsen if not properly managed.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of an underlying infection, and may increase the risk of bleeding and other complications.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may increase the risk of bleeding and other complications.
4. Dystonic reactions: The patient's dystonic reaction to reglan may recur if the medication is continued, and may lead to respiratory compromise and other complications.
5. Pain control: The patient's acute pain may not be adequately managed, which may lead to increased stress and other complications.
6. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be a sign of an underlying infection or other condition, and may increase the risk of cardiac complications.

In conclusion, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a complex medical condition that requires close monitoring and management. The patient's respiratory failure, leukocytosis, pain control, and tachycardia are all potential complications that may arise, and require careful attention and management to prevent worsening of the patient's condition."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a complex medical history. Over the past 24 hours, the patient has experienced episodes of nausea and vomiting, requiring adjustments to their medication regimen. They have been given D5, 1/2NS bolus and maintenance, and their pain has been managed with dilaudid and methadone. The patient's oncologist plans to start chemotherapy today and obtain a CT scan for staging.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 123 bpm, and blood pressure of 160/81 mmHg. They have a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 98%. Their physical examination reveals an agitated patient with a warm and well-perfused skin, patent airways, and a tachycardic heart rate.

Laboratory results show the patient has leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits, and they have a slightly elevated glucose level.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and they have coarse rhonchi and stridorous upper airway sounds, which may indicate early signs of respiratory failure.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process.
3. Pain control: The patient's pain has been managed with dilaudid and methadone, but they may still experience breakthrough pain, which requires close monitoring and adjustment of their pain medication regimen.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may indicate an underlying cardiac condition or response to their medication regimen.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers may indicate an underlying infection, which requires prompt recognition and treatment.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may indicate a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the presence of upper airway bleeding.
7. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's tachycardia and elevated heart rate may increase their risk of cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in the presence of electrolyte imbalances.

These potential complications require close monitoring and prompt recognition to prevent adverse outcomes and ensure the patient receives optimal care."

   71-year-old white female with eophageal CA, admitted to NEB and
   [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for chemotherapy and XRT. She was
   transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for respiratory distress and emergent bronch.
   .
   PLAN:
   .
   #. Respiratory Distress: Pt with y-stent and presents with acute
   hypoxia. Pt with evidence of upper airway obstruction on exam
   concerning for mucus plugging given secreations and cough or
   malfunction of the Y-stent. Either malposition or obstruction.  Other
   possibilites, but less likely include PE (pt with underlying
   malignancy, but hypoxia was transient), pneumonia, PTX less likely
   given uncchanged CXR. Pt is able to maintain states at 100%.
   - cont nebs (albuterol, ipratropium, mucomyst)
   - cont mucinex [**Hospital1 **]
   - pulmonary toliet
   - Moxifloxacin per prior discharge for 2 more days
   - closely monitor resp status
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Pt has been afebrile. DDx inlcudes reactive
   leukocytosis from aspiration pneumonitis. CXR did not show acute
   infiltrate concerning for pna.
   - pt was previously on Moxifloxacin at time of discharge, will complete
   2 week course. Hold on additional abx for now
   - cont to trend WBC
   - f/u BCx, UA/UCx
   .
   #Agitation: Possible medication induced. Pt with paradoxical reaction
   to ativan in the past per husband.  She did receive BZD this AM.
   - haldol 0.25prn for agitation
   - re-started fentanyl patch and
 home methadone dose
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Likely agitation and resp distress contributing. Pt was
   tachy on admission to 110-120's. Also likely dry given poor po intake.
   No ECG in record, but reportly sinus tach.
   - IV fluids, gentle 250cc NS bolus then maintence
   -will re-start tube feeds today if no further need for bronchoscopy
   .
   # Esophageal Ca: Chemotherapy per primary oncologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 876**]. Plan was
   to start chemo/XRT this admission.  Will follow-up with Onc.
   -consult Rad/Onc for starting XRT
   .
   # Nausea/vomiting: Patient doesn
t c/o nausea and no more dry heaves
   witnessed.
   - zofran prn
   - IV PPI
   .
   # Pain management: Holding pain meds given respiratory distress for
   now.  Will add back regimen after bronch and stablized.
   - restart methadone at
 home dose, fentanyl patches.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be identified:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 71-year-old white female with esophageal cancer, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and acute hypoxia. She has a history of chronic pain, nausea, and vomiting. She was recently started on chemotherapy and was scheduled to receive XRT. The patient has been experiencing episodes of nausea and vomiting, and has been treated with antiemetics and pain medications. She has also been experiencing tachycardia, likely due to agitation and respiratory distress.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and she is at risk of developing respiratory failure. The plan is to continue nebs, mucinex, and pulmonary toilet, and to closely monitor her respiratory status.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, and she may be at risk of developing infection. The plan is to continue antibiotics and to monitor her white blood cell count.
3. Agitation: The patient is experiencing agitation, which may be due to medication or underlying medical conditions. The plan is to use haloperidol and fentanyl to manage her agitation.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be due to agitation, respiratory distress, or dehydration. The plan is to use IV fluids and to monitor her heart rate.
5. Nausea and Vomiting: The patient is experiencing nausea and vomiting, which may be due to chemotherapy or other underlying medical conditions. The plan is to use antiemetics and to monitor her symptoms.
6. Pain Management: The patient is experiencing pain, which may be due to her underlying medical condition or surgical procedures. The plan is to use pain medications and to monitor her pain level.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, and her thyroid medication should be continued.
8. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and her blood pressure should be monitored regularly.
9. DVT Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk of developing DVT, and prophylactic heparin should be continued.
10. VAP Prophylaxis: The patient is at risk of developing VAP, and prophylactic antibiotics should be continued.

Overall, the patient is at risk of developing several medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 71-year-old white female with esophageal cancer, admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and acute hypoxia. She has a history of chronic pain, nausea, vomiting, and hypothyroidism. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including pain management medications, antinauseants, and antihypertensives. She has been experiencing episodes of agitation, poor pain control, and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and acute hypoxia may lead to further respiratory failure, requiring closer monitoring and potential intubation.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of infection or inflammation, which could worsen her respiratory status and increase the risk of sepsis.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be a sign of agitation, pain, or respiratory distress, which could lead to cardiac complications if not managed promptly.
4. Nausea and Vomiting: The patient's nausea and vomiting may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and malnutrition, which could worsen her overall condition.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may be exacerbated by her current medications and medical conditions, leading to further complications if not managed properly.
6. DVT: The patient's prophylactic anticoagulation therapy may not be sufficient to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which could lead to serious complications if not detected early.
7. VAP: The patient's presence in the ICU increases her risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which could lead to further respiratory complications and increased mortality.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory status, pain, and nausea. She should continue to receive antinauseants, pain management medications, and antihypertensives as needed. The patient's leukocytosis should be trended and monitored for signs of infection or inflammation. The patient's hypothyroidism should be managed with her current medications and close monitoring. The patient's DVT prophylaxis should be continued, and the patient should be monitored for signs of DVT. The patient's VAP risk should be minimized by proper hand hygiene, ventilator care, and antibiotic stewardship."
