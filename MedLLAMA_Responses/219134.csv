   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo female with history of bipolar d/o and now found outside of home
   with unresponsive state.  Patient to [**Hospital1 **] for evaluation where son
   noted patient was well the day prior.  At [**Hospital1 **] patient with
   hyperglycemia and negative CT/LP and patient to [**Hospital1 5**] for further care
   following 1g of Dilantin.  She has remained with persistent altered
   mental status and to this point remains unresponsive.  Vanco/Zosyn/CTX
   was given and patient admitted to ICU for further care.
   1) ALTERED MENTAL STATUS/COMA
She has impaired and persistent coma
   noted at this time.  This raises concern for diffuse cortical insult
   which has not been seen with tox screen, LP, look for systemic
   infection which have not been revealing.  This would leave possible
   pontine level infarct as driver of insult with non-convulsive status
   being second most likely insult.
   -MRI this morning
   -EEG this morning
   -Will move to treatment for seizures  based on EEG findings and
   clinical response but would like to defer on treatment for seizures
   until EEG completed.
   2) HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)-_This may be hypovolemic but perhaps
   vasodilatory in the setting of severe neurologic insult consistent with
   neurogenic shock is most likely.
   -Levophed as needed
   -Fluid bolus as needed
   -Empiric antibiotics reasonable
   3)Aspiraiton
patient at risk for aspiration event with altered mental
   status and will have to continue to suction frequently and maintain
   adequate airway protection.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of bipolar disorder who was found unresponsive outside her home. She was admitted to the hospital and later transferred to the ICU. The patient's current condition is:

* Comatose with decorticate posture and diminished reflexes
* Hypotensive (BP: 93/30 mmHg) with a possibility of neurogenic shock
* Fever (100.1°F) with a normal white blood cell count (WBC: 12.2 K/uL)
* Elevated lactate level (1.5 mmol/L) and troponin-T level (<0.01 ng/mL)
* Abnormal lab results, including elevated creatinine (0.7 mg/dL), glucose (291 mg/dL), and liver enzymes (ALT: 79 IU/L, AST: 79 IU/L)

The patient's medical history includes:

* History of bipolar disorder
* Previous admission to the hospital for hyperglycemia and negative CT/LP
* Treatment with Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Ceftriaxone

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to the patient's altered mental status and risk of aspiration
* Sepsis or septic shock due to the patient's elevated lactate level and potential systemic infection
* Cardiac complications due to the patient's hypotension and elevated troponin-T level
* Neurological complications due to the patient's coma and potential pontine level infarct
* Gastrointestinal complications due to the patient's risk of aspiration and potential stress ulcer

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Monitoring of vital signs and lab results
* Treatment with Norepinephrine for hypotension
* Empiric antibiotics for potential systemic infection
* Seizure prophylaxis based on EEG findings and clinical response
* Frequent suctioning and maintenance of adequate airway protection
* Nutritional support via NPO
* Glycemic control
* Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer
* VAP prevention

The patient's code status is currently set to full code, but this may need to be clarified. The patient's disposition is currently ICU."

   MRI Head (wet read):
   No [**Known lastname **] infarction, or mass
   CXR [**2-16**]:
   Exam is limited by respiratory motion. Even within this limitation,
   there has
   been a change in the appearance of the lower right hemithorax with a
   new area
   of increased opacity obscuring the right heart border as well as new
   blunting
   of the right costophrenic sulcus. Observed findings are likely due to a
   combination of right middle lobe atelectasis and a right pleural
   effusion.
   There is likely a component of atelectasis involving the right lower
   lobe as
   well. Cardiomediastinal contours are grossly unchanged, and previously
   reported interstitial edema appears similar in the interval as well.
   When the
   patient's condition allows, a repeat radiograph with suspended
   inspiration
   would be helpful for more complete assessment of these findings.
   CXR [**2-16**] #2:
   IMPRESSION: Successful intubation without evidence of pneumothorax. NG
   position unremarkable. Previously suspected right-sided pleural
   effusion not
   progressing and mostly resolved.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old female with diabetes, HTN, HL, bipolar
   disorder with multiple prior suicide attempts from medication overdoses
   who is admitted with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered mental status.  Unclear etiology.  MRI showed no infarct.
   LP results from OSH unremarkable.  All tox screens negative.  Hepatitis
   C positive, but ammonia normal. Currently undergoing 24-hr EEG with
   dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures. As she is now
   intubated, her MS exam is somewhat limited.
   - neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u culture data
   - empiric antibiotics for now
   .
   #.  Aspiration Pneumonia/respiratory status
 Patient had an aspiration
   event yesterday, and was intubated for airway safety.  Spiked T of
   100.4 yesterday afternoon, afebrile since.  Currenly, lungs are clear,
   mental status improving
   -          repeat CXR
   -          SBT, extubate if her mental status improves
   -          Consider either stopping antibiotics if CXR clear, or
   broadening spectrum to cover anaerobes (given aspiration event) &/or
   pseudomonas if she deteriorates.
   .
   #.  Hypotension.  Differential for hypotension is hypovolemic versus
   septic.  She is positive 4L since admission, still on levophed.  Good
   UOP.
   - IVF boluses
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - follow urine output
   - hold lisinopril
   .
   #.  Hyperglycemia.  Patient presented with hyperglycemia to 450 which
   has responded to insulin.  No evidence of DKA.
   - HISS
   - follow fingersticks
   - hold actos, glyburide, metformin
   .
   5.  Bipolar disorder.  Patient has a history of bipolar disorder, on
   disability.  Multiple prior overdoses with medications.
   - hold lexapro
   .
   6.  Hepatitis C.  Patient with ALT of 142, AST 83, with normal
   albumin.  INR normal at OSH.  Per son, this is a recent diagnosis.
   LFTs stable yesterday.  Ammonia normal. No evidence of cirrhosis by
   labs or on exam.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 62-year-old female with altered mental status, intubated for airway protection.
* She has a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and bipolar disorder with multiple prior suicide attempts.
* She is positive for Hepatitis C and has been diagnosed with it recently.
* She has had an aspiration event yesterday and is currently being treated for aspiration pneumonia.
* She has been intubated for airway safety and is being monitored closely.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Seizures:** The patient has been started on dilantin for possible intermittent seizures, and a 24-hour EEG is ongoing. The patient's mental status is improving, but the risk of seizures remains.
2. **Pneumonia:** The patient has had an aspiration event and is at risk for developing pneumonia. Repeat CXR and SBT (spontaneous breathing trial) may be necessary to assess lung function.
3. **Sepsis:** The patient's hypotension is concerning for sepsis, particularly given her positive Hepatitis C status. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to rule out sepsis.
4. **Hypoglycemia:** The patient has hyperglycemia, but the risk of hypoglycemia is high given the insulin treatment. Close monitoring of fingerstick glucose levels is necessary.
5. **Liver Damage:** The patient's Hepatitis C status and elevated LFTs (ALT 142, AST 83) are concerning for liver damage. Close monitoring of liver function tests and trend analysis is necessary.
6. **Bipolar Disorder:** The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and is at risk for medication-related suicide attempts. Close monitoring of mental status and medication side effects is necessary.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue monitoring the patient's mental status and seizure activity.
2. Repeat CXR and SBT to assess lung function.
3. Wean levophed as tolerated and monitor urine output.
4. Hold lisinopril and other medications that may exacerbate hypotension.
5. Continue insulin treatment for hyperglycemia and monitor fingerstick glucose levels.
6. Trend liver function tests and monitor for signs of liver damage.
7. Consider stopping antibiotics if CXR is clear, or broadening spectrum to cover anaerobes and/or pseudomonas if the patient deteriorates.
8. Hold lexapro and other medications that may exacerbate bipolar disorder."

   MRI Head (wet read):
   No [**Known lastname **] infarction, or mass
   CXR [**2-16**]:
   Exam is limited by respiratory motion. Even within this limitation,
   there has
   been a change in the appearance of the lower right hemithorax with a
   new area
   of increased opacity obscuring the right heart border as well as new
   blunting
   of the right costophrenic sulcus. Observed findings are likely due to a
   combination of right middle lobe atelectasis and a right pleural
   effusion.
   There is likely a component of atelectasis involving the right lower
   lobe as
   well. Cardiomediastinal contours are grossly unchanged, and previously
   reported interstitial edema appears similar in the interval as well.
   When the
   patient's condition allows, a repeat radiograph with suspended
   inspiration
   would be helpful for more complete assessment of these findings.
   CXR [**2-16**] #2:
   IMPRESSION: Successful intubation without evidence of pneumothorax. NG
   position unremarkable. Previously suspected right-sided pleural
   effusion not
   progressing and mostly resolved.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old female with diabetes, HTN, HL, bipolar
   disorder with multiple prior suicide attempts from medication overdoses
   who is admitted with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered mental status.  Unclear etiology.  MRI showed no infarct.
   LP results from OSH unremarkable.  All tox screens negative.  Hepatitis
   C positive, but ammonia normal. Currently undergoing 24-hr EEG with
   dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures. As she is now
   intubated, her MS exam is somewhat limited.
   - neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u culture data
   - empiric antibiotics
   .
   #. Aspiration Pneumonia/respiratory status
 Patient had an aspiration
   event yesterday, and was intubated for airway safety.  Spiked T of
   100.4 yesterday afternoon, afebrile since.  Currenly, lungs are clear,
   mental status improving
   -          repeat CXR
   -          SBT, extubate if her mental status
   .
   #.  Hypotension.  Differential for hypotension is hypovolemic versus
   septic.  She is positive 4L since admission, still on levophed.  Good
   UOP.
   - IVF boluses
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - follow urine output
   - hold lisinopril
   .
   3.  Elevated lactate.  Elevated lactate raises the possibility of an
   infection infectious workup is negative thus far.  Also, could be
   secondary to seizure activity.
   - trend lactate
   - IVFs boluses prn
   - empiric antibiotics with ceftriaxone/vanco pending culture data
   .
   4.  Hyperglycemia.  Patient presented with hyperglycemia to 450 which
   has responded to insulin.  No evidence of DKA.
   - HISS
   - follow fingersticks
   - hold actos, glyburide, metformin
   .
   5.  Bipolar disorder.  Patient has a history of bipolar disorder, on
   disability.  Multiple prior overdoses with medications.
   - hold lexapro
   .
   6.  Hepatitis C.  Patient with ALT of 142, AST 83, with normal
   albumin.  INR normal at OSH.  Per son, this is a recent diagnosis.
   LFTs stable yesterday.  Ammonia normal. No evidence of cirrhosis by
   labs or on exam.
   - trend LFTs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, bipolar disorder, and hepatitis C. The patient's mental status has improved, but she remains intubated due to an aspiration event.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated lactate levels, which may be secondary to infection or seizure activity. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with elevated ALT and AST levels, but normal albumin and INR levels. The patient's ammonia levels are normal, and there is no evidence of cirrhosis.

The patient's radiology results show a new area of increased opacity in the right lower hemithorax on chest X-ray, which may be due to right middle lobe atelectasis and right pleural effusion. The patient's magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed no infarction or mass.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is unclear, and the etiology is unknown. The patient is undergoing 24-hour EEG with dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures.
2. Aspiration pneumonia/respiratory status: The patient had an aspiration event and was intubated for airway safety. The patient's lungs are currently clear, and their mental status is improving.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to hypovolemia or sepsis. The patient is receiving IV fluids and levophed, and their urine output is good.
4. Elevated lactate: The patient's elevated lactate levels may be secondary to infection or seizure activity. The patient is receiving empiric antibiotics and IV fluids.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient presented with hyperglycemia, which has responded to insulin. The patient's blood sugar levels are being monitored, and they are receiving insulin therapy.
6. Hepatitis C: The patient has a recent diagnosis of hepatitis C, and their LFTs are abnormal. The patient is receiving antiviral therapy.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels and abnormal LFTs may indicate sepsis.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration event and abnormal chest X-ray may indicate pneumonia.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's intubation and respiratory support may indicate respiratory failure.
4. Seizure activity: The patient's abnormal EEG and elevated lactate levels may indicate seizure activity.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's abnormal LFTs and elevated lactate levels may indicate hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust their anticonvulsant therapy as needed.
2. Continue to provide respiratory support and monitor the patient's lung function.
3. Continue to provide IV fluids and antibiotics for the patient's suspected infection.
4. Monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust their antiviral therapy as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and adjust their insulin therapy as needed.
6. Consider the patient's history of bipolar disorder and suicidal ideation, and provide appropriate psychological support and counseling."

   MRI Head (wet read):
   No [**Known lastname **] infarction, or mass
   CXR [**2-16**]:
   Exam is limited by respiratory motion. Even within this limitation,
   there has
   been a change in the appearance of the lower right hemithorax with a
   new area
   of increased opacity obscuring the right heart border as well as new
   blunting
   of the right costophrenic sulcus. Observed findings are likely due to a
   combination of right middle lobe atelectasis and a right pleural
   effusion.
   There is likely a component of atelectasis involving the right lower
   lobe as
   well. Cardiomediastinal contours are grossly unchanged, and previously
   reported interstitial edema appears similar in the interval as well.
   When the
   patient's condition allows, a repeat radiograph with suspended
   inspiration
   would be helpful for more complete assessment of these findings.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   MRI Head (wet read):
   No [**Known lastname **] infarction, or mass
   CXR [**2-16**]:
   Exam is limited by respiratory motion. Even within this limitation,
   there has
   been a change in the appearance of the lower right hemithorax with a
   new area
   of increased opacity obscuring the right heart border as well as new
   blunting
   of the right costophrenic sulcus. Observed findings are likely due to a
   combination of right middle lobe atelectasis and a right pleural
   effusion.
   There is likely a component of atelectasis involving the right lower
   lobe as
   well. Cardiomediastinal contours are grossly unchanged, and previously
   reported interstitial edema appears similar in the interval as well.
   When the
   patient's condition allows, a repeat radiograph with suspended
   inspiration
   would be helpful for more complete assessment of these findings.
   CXR [**2-16**] #2:
   IMPRESSION: Successful intubation without evidence of pneumothorax. NG
   position unremarkable. Previously suspected right-sided pleural
   effusion not
   progressing and mostly resolved.
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old female with diabetes, HTN, HL, bipolar
   disorder with multiple prior suicide attempts from medication overdoses
   who is admitted with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered mental status.  Unclear etiology.  MRI showed no infarct.
   LP results from OSH unremarkable.  All tox screens negative.  Hepatitis
   C positive, but ammonia normal. Currently undergoing 24-hr EEG with
   dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures. As she is now
   intubated and sedated it is difficult to follow her exam
   - neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u culture data
   - periodically wean sedation to assess mental status
   - empiric antibiotics
   .
   #. Aspiration Pneumonia
 Patient had an aspiration event yesterday,
   and was intubated for airway safety.  Spiked T of 100.4 yesterday
   afternoon, afebrile since.
   - consider broadening coverage given intubated on vent, in ICU,
   ceftriaxone to zosyn.
   - CXR
   .
   #.  Hypotension.  Differential for hypotension is hypovolemic versus
   septic.  She is positive 4L since admission, still on levophed.  Good
   UOP.
   - IVF boluses
   - antibiotics as above
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - follow urine output
   - hold home lisinopril
   .
   3.  Elevated lactate.  Elevated lactate raises the possibility of an
   infection infectious workup is negative thus far.  Also, could be
   secondary to seizure activity.
   - trend lactate
   - IVFs boluses prn
   - empiric antibiotics with ceftriaxone/vanco pending culture data
   .
   4.  Hyperglycemia.  Patient presented with hyperglycemia to 450 which
   has responded to insulin.  No evidence of DKA.
   - HISS
   - follow fingersticks
   - hold actos, glyburide, metformin
   .
   5.  Bipolar disorder.  Patient has a history of bipolar disorder, on
   disability.  Multiple prior overdoses with medications.
   - hold lexapro
   .
   6.  Hepatitis C.  Patient with ALT of 142, AST 83, with normal
   albumin.  INR normal at OSH.  Per son, this is a recent diagnosis.
   LFTs stable yesterday.  Ammonia normal. No evidence of cirrhosis by
   labs or on exam.
   - trend LFTs
   .
   7.  Hyperlipidemia.
   - hold simvastatin given elevated LFTs and inability to take POs

   Imaging: MRI Head--No abnormalities seen on read of MRI
   CXR--none new--improved aeration following intubation
   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo female with admission with COMA.  She has a history of substance
   abuse but no ingestion suspected, reported or found.  She does have
   bipolar diagnosis but no evidence of recent trauma or worsening of
   underlying mental health disease.  No recent prodrome of infection, no
   fever and no evidence of meningitis.  We have concern for possible
   seizure--with non-convulsive status or dense post ictal state driving
   exam.
   1)Altered Mental Status-Differential above
she has improved through to
   this morning
   -Dilantin load in place
   -EEG for 24 hours today.
   -Will move towards extubation today to faciliate better examination
   going forward.
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -This was secondary to altered mental status and aspiration event with
   hypoxemia.  Much of the infiltrate was resolved in the setting of
   intubation but with some persistence
   -We have minimal secretions at this time
   -Will continue antibiotics that were started in the setting of concern
   for meningitis as we are now treating pneumonia
   -Move to SBT today and extubation with patient able to respond to
   commands
   3) HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   -Levophed to look to wean to off today and have minimal dose
   -Will continue with wean
   -[**Month (only) 8**] see improvement with resolution of active pneumonitis and will
   continue with antibiotics

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo female with admission with COMA.  She has a history of substance
   abuse but no ingestion suspected, reported or found.  She does have
   bipolar diagnosis but no evidence of recent trauma or worsening of
   underlying mental health disease.  No recent prodrome of infection, no
   fever and no evidence of meningitis.  We have concern for possible
   seizure--with non-convulsive status or dense post ictal state driving
   exam.
   1)Altered Mental Status-Differential above
she has improved through to
   this morning
   -Dilantin load in place
   -EEG for 24 hours today.
   -Will move towards extubation today to faciliate better examination
   going forward.
   2)Respiratory Failure-
   -This was secondary to altered mental status and aspiration event with
   hypoxemia.  Much of the infiltrate was resolved in the setting of
   intubation but with some persistence
   -We have minimal secretions at this time
   -Will continue antibiotics that were started in the setting of concern
   for meningitis as we are now treating pneumonia
   -Move to SBT today and extubation with patient able to respond to
   commands
   3) HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   -Levophed to look to wean to off today and have minimal dose
   -Will continue with wean
   -[**Month (only) 8**] see improvement with resolution of active pneumonitis and will
   continue with antibiotics

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a coma and respiratory failure. She has a history of substance abuse and bipolar disorder, but no evidence of recent trauma or infection. She was intubated due to persistent aspiration, hypoxia, and altered mental status. She has been receiving antibiotics for pneumonia and is being treated with norepinephrine for hypotension. Her respiratory support includes invasive ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a Vt of 500 mL and FiO2 of 50%. Her laboratory results show mild anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes. Her MRI and CXR are normal.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications:
	* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
	* Barotrauma due to high peak inspiratory pressure (PIP)
	* Pulmonary edema due to fluid overload
2. Neurological Complications:
	* Seizure activity due to non-convulsive status or dense post-ictal state
	* Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to elevated blood pressure
	* Cerebral edema due to hypoxia and hypotension
3. Cardiovascular Complications:
	* Cardiac arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances
	* Myocardial infarction (MI) due to hypotension and tachycardia
	* Cardiac failure due to fluid overload and hypertension
4. Infection-Related Complications:
	* Meningitis due to bacterial or viral infection
	* Sepsis due to pneumonia or other infections
	* Organ failure due to sepsis
5. Nutritional Complications:
	* Malnutrition due to NPO status and inadequate nutrition
	* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to insulin therapy
6. Other Complications:
	* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and hypercoagulability
	* Stress ulcer due to critical illness and medication

These potential complications highlight the importance of close monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory, neurological, cardiovascular, and nutritional status, as well as the need for prompt recognition and treatment of any infections or other complications that may arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, bipolar disorder, and hepatitis C, was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient had a supratherapeutic Lamictal level and a history of suicide attempts. The patient was previously intubated but was extubated. The patient's EEG is pending, and they are currently undergoing a 24-hour EEG with a Dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures. The patient is now waking up but is agitated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, and blood pressure of 121/63 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is improving, with clear lungs and a SpO2 of 97%. The patient's neurological status is improving, with the ability to verbalize and communicate.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure activity: The patient's supratherapeutic Lamictal level and history of suicide attempts increase the risk of seizure activity. The patient is currently undergoing a 24-hour EEG with a Dilantin load to monitor for possible intermittent seizures.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but the patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure increases the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Infection: The patient's history of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure increases the risk of infection. The patient's blood cultures and respiratory cultures are pending.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but the patient's history of hypotension and the use of vasopressors increases the risk of hypotension.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is stable, but the patient's history of hyperglycemia and the use of insulin increases the risk of hypoglycemia.
6. Hepatitis C: The patient's history of hepatitis C and the use of antiviral medications increases the risk of liver damage and failure.
7. Bipolar disorder: The patient's history of bipolar disorder and the use of psychiatric medications increases the risk of mood instability and suicidal behavior.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's history of hyperlipidemia and the use of statins increases the risk of liver damage and failure.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's seizure activity and adjust the Dilantin dose as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust the oxygen therapy as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's blood glucose level and adjust the insulin dose as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function tests and adjust the antiviral medications as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's mood and adjust the psychiatric medications as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's lipid levels and adjust the statins as necessary.
7. Plan for a family meeting to discuss the patient's condition and treatment plan.
8. Plan for a transfer to the floor when the patient's condition stabilizes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old individual who was admitted to the ICU in an unresponsive state. The patient has been extubated and is currently verbal and communicative. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 99.5°F, heart rate of 85 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 121/63 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show normal ranges for hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelet count. The patient's liver function tests are mildly elevated, with an ALT of 127 IU/L and AST of 79 IU/L. The patient's renal function is normal, with a creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show resolution of interstitial edema and clearing of asymmetrical opacities in the right lung. The patient has a small left pleural effusion, which appears slightly larger than previously.

The patient's medical history is significant for chronic small vessel ischemic changes, and the patient has an incidental finding of cavum septum pellucidum et vergae on MRI/MRA.

The patient is at risk for potential medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's recent extubation and normalization of vital signs suggest that the patient's respiratory status is improving. However, the patient is still at risk for respiratory failure due to the underlying chronic small vessel ischemic changes and potential for aspiration.
2. Neurological deterioration: The patient's altered mental status and inability to protect the airway pose a risk for neurological deterioration. The patient's recent improvement in mental status is encouraging, but further monitoring is necessary to ensure that the patient's neurological status does not deteriorate.
3. Infection: The patient's recent blood culture and respiratory culture results are pending, and the patient is at risk for developing a nosocomial infection. The patient's recent antibiotic administration and prophylactic measures, such as stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis, are aimed at reducing this risk.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance is stable, but the patient is at risk for developing fluid imbalance due to the underlying chronic small vessel ischemic changes and potential for edema.

In summary, the patient is at risk for respiratory failure, neurological deterioration, infection, and fluid imbalance. Further monitoring and management are necessary to ensure that the patient's condition does not deteriorate and to address any potential complications that may arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old female with diabetes, HTN, HL, bipolar
   disorder with multiple prior suicide attempts from medication overdoses
   who is admitted with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered mental status.  Unclear etiology.  MRI showed no infarct.
   LP results from OSH unremarkable.  All tox screens negative.  Hepatitis
   C positive, but ammonia normal. Currently undergoing 24-hr EEG with
   dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures. As she is now
   intubated, her MS exam is somewhat limited.
   - neuro recs
   - f/u EEG
   - f/u culture data
   - empiric antibiotics for now
   .
   #.  Aspiration Pneumonia/respiratory status
 Patient had an aspiration
   event yesterday, and was intubated for airway safety.  Spiked T of
   100.4 yesterday afternoon, afebrile since.  Currenly, lungs are clear,
   mental status improving
   -          repeat CXR
   -          SBT, extubate if her mental status improves
   -          Consider either stopping antibiotics if CXR clear, or
   broadening spectrum to cover anaerobes (given aspiration event) &/or
   pseudomonas if she deteriorates.
   .
   #.  Hypotension.  Differential for hypotension is hypovolemic versus
   septic.  She is positive 4L since admission, still on levophed.  Good
   UOP.
   - IVF boluses
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - follow urine output
   - hold lisinopril
   .
   #.  Hyperglycemia.  Patient presented with hyperglycemia to 450 which
   has responded to insulin.  No evidence of DKA.
   - HISS

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient has a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, bipolar disorder, and multiple prior suicide attempts. She was intubated due to an aspiration event and has been on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 121/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her neurologic examination is limited due to intubation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of troponin T, CK, and ALT, but normal levels of troponin I and lactate. Her liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with elevated levels of ALT and AST, but normal albumin and INR. Her complete blood count (CBC) shows a mild anemia and thrombocytopenia.

The patient has been receiving antibiotics for possible pneumonia, and the culture results are pending. She has also been treated with anticonvulsants for possible seizures.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Seizures: The patient's altered mental status and possible intermittent seizures may lead to seizure activity, which could worsen her condition.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's aspiration event and intubation may increase the risk of developing pneumonia, which could lead to respiratory failure.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to hypovolemia or septic shock, which could worsen her condition if not properly managed.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycemia (HONK), which could worsen her condition.
5. Hepatitis C: The patient's recent diagnosis of hepatitis C may lead to liver dysfunction, which could worsen her condition.
6. Bipolar disorder: The patient's history of bipolar disorder may lead to manic episodes or depression, which could worsen her condition.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's intubation and possible pneumonia may lead to respiratory failure, which could worsen her condition.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue antibiotics for possible pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's neurologic status and consider EEG monitoring.
3. Manage the patient's hypotension with IV fluids and vasopressors as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's hyperglycemia and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
5. Trend the patient's LFTs and consider liver function tests.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider extubation if her mental status improves.
7. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP prevention measures.
8. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk due to her thrombocytopenia.
9. Consider transferring the patient to a floor bed when her condition stabilizes."

 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH):  Good sats on 2 L nasal cannula.  CXR
   improved in right base raising the question of aspiration pneumonitis
   given rapid clearing, ?blunting left CPA.  Will repeat CXR.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Unclear etiology.  EEG being
   done to evaluate for seizure.  On dilantin.  Given history of bipolar
   disorder and prior history of suicide attempts, will also consult
   psychiatry.  Stable for transfer to the floor albeit will need a sitter
   per nursing.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK):  Unclear etiology, empirically covered with
   levophed, vanco/ceftriaxone, off pressors since yesterday morning.  No
   new culture data.  Check UA.  If outside hosptial culutres also
   negative would discontinue antibiotics.
 HYPOKALEMIA:  Repleted.  Following serial lytes.  Also will give Mg.
 HYPERNATREMIA:  Calculate free water deficit.  Appears euvolemic on
   exam, will replace free water and follow electrolytes.
 DM:  On insulin sliding scale.
   Else agree with detailed assessment and plan as per medical ICU
   resident's note.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH):  Good sats on 2 L nasal cannula.  CXR
   improved in right base raising the question of aspiration pneumonitis
   given rapid clearing, ?blunting left CPA.  Will repeat CXR.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Unclear etiology.  EEG being
   done to evaluate for seizure.  On dilantin.  Given history of bipolar
   disorder and prior history of suicide attempts, will also consult
   psychiatry.  Stable for transfer to the floor albeit will need a sitter
   per nursing.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK):  Unclear etiology, empirically covered with
   levophed, vanco/ceftriaxone, off pressors since yesterday morning.  No
   new culture data.  Check UA.  If outside hosptial culutres also
   negative would discontinue antibiotics.
 HYPOKALEMIA:  Repleted.  Following serial lytes.  Also will give Mg.
 HYPERNATREMIA:  Calculate free water deficit.  Appears euvolemic on
   exam, will replace free water and follow electrolytes.
 DM:  On insulin sliding scale.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a comatose individual with respiratory failure, who has been intubated and extubated, and is currently receiving oxygen via nasal cannula. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, and blood pressure of 138/55 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 24 inspirations per minute, and their oxygen saturation is 96%.

The patient has a history of bipolar disorder and has made prior suicide attempts, and as such, they are being evaluated for seizure activity with an EEG and are receiving dilantin. The patient's mental status is altered, but not delirious, and they are unable to provide a history.

The patient has a risk of aspiration due to their inability to protect their airway, and their chest X-ray shows improved clearing in the right base, which may indicate aspiration pneumonitis. The patient's left CPA is unclear, and a repeat chest X-ray is planned.

The patient's hypotension is unclear in etiology, but they have been empirically covered with levophed, vanco, and ceftriaxone, and are now off pressors. The patient's urine output is adequate, and their electrolytes are being closely monitored.

The patient has a risk of hyperkalemia due to their hypotension, and their potassium levels are being closely monitored. They also have a risk of hypernatremia, and their sodium levels are being closely monitored.

The patient's glycemic control is being managed with regular insulin sliding scale, and they are receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient's inability to protect their airway puts them at risk of aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia and respiratory failure.
2. Seizure activity: The patient's altered mental status and history of bipolar disorder and suicide attempts put them at risk of seizure activity, which can lead to further complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's unclear etiology of hypotension puts them at risk of further complications, such as organ failure and shock.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient's risk of hyperkalemia due to their hypotension and electrolyte imbalance puts them at risk of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's risk of hypernatremia due to their sodium imbalance puts them at risk of seizures, coma, and death.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure puts them at risk of further complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory failure.
7. Infection: The patient's risk of infection due to their prolonged hospitalization and altered immune function puts them at risk of sepsis and organ failure.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to their altered mental status and medications puts them at risk of bleeding complications.
9. Thrombosis: The patient's risk of thrombosis due to their immobility and electrolyte imbalance puts them at risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
10. Malnutrition: The patient's risk of malnutrition due to their altered mental status and inability to eat puts them at risk of further complications, such as weight loss and muscle wasting."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, multiple prior suicide attempts, and is currently taking lamictal. The patient's supratherapeutic lamictal level and reported ingestion of 24 pills suggest that the ingestion is likely the etiology of her altered mental status.

The patient's current condition is characterized by agitation, with increasing agitation overnight. She is currently receiving haloperidol for agitation and has a 1:1 sitter assigned. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, and blood pressure of 108/42 mmHg.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be monitored and managed:

1. Seizure risk: The patient is undergoing 24-hour EEG with dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures. Monitoring of seizure activity and adjusting medication as needed is crucial.
2. Respiratory compromise: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is at risk for respiratory compromise. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory status is essential.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, and hypotension may recur. Monitoring of blood pressure and adjusting fluid management as needed is important.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient presented with hyperglycemia, which has responded to insulin. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjusting insulin therapy as needed is crucial.
5. Hepatitis C: The patient has a recent diagnosis of hepatitis C, with abnormal liver function tests. Monitoring of liver function tests and adjusting treatment as needed is important.
6. Suicidal ideation: The patient has a history of suicide attempts and is currently taking haloperidol for agitation. Close monitoring of the patient's mental status and adjusting treatment as needed is essential.

In terms of plan, the patient will continue to be monitored closely in the ICU, with adjustments to medication and treatment as needed. A psychiatry consult has been recommended, and the patient will need to be admitted to a psychiatric unit once medically stable. The patient's family will need to be educated on her condition and treatment plan, and a family meeting will be held to discuss her care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU due to lamotrigine overdose and agitation. She was found to have a lamotrigine level of 35, which is above the normal range of 25. She has been treated with haloperidol for agitation and has been placed on a 1:1 sitter. Her EEG was initially negative, and she has been cleared to discontinue dilantin. Her hypernatremia has resolved, and her antibiotic regimen has been stopped due to negative culture data. She has also had an improvement in her CXR.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, and blood pressure of 108/42 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula. Her laboratory results show elevated troponin and CK levels, indicating possible cardiac damage. Her other laboratory results are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications:

1. Lamotrigine toxicity: The patient's lamotrigine level is above the normal range, which may lead to toxicity and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Cardiac damage: The patient's elevated troponin and CK levels suggest possible cardiac damage, which may lead to further complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
3. Infection: The patient's positive blood and urine cultures may indicate an underlying infection, which may lead to sepsis, organ failure, or death.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's agitation and increased muscle tone may be indicative of neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's hypernatremia may have caused gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, which may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support with nasal cannula may not be sufficient to maintain adequate oxygenation, which may lead to respiratory failure or complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

   ICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient with the medical ICU residents, the
   assessment and plan was discussed and is detailed above.  I would add
   and emphasize the following.
   Patient more alert this am, pleasant.  Didn
t recall meeting us from
   yesterday, knows she is in the [**Hospital1 5**].  Denies pain, SOB.
   Lungs CTA Abdomen soft, good BS No edema
   As above, etiology of here unresponsiveness likely secondary to
   lamictal overdose.  Appreciate input from neurology and psychiatry
   services.  Preliminary read on EEG is not seizure activity, will
   confirm with neuro and discontinue dilantin.  Agree with sitter
   awaiting inpatient  placement for psychiatric care.
   Time spent:  25 minutes

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 62 year old female with diabetes, HTN, HL, bipolar
   disorder with multiple prior suicide attempts from medication overdoses
   who is admitted with altered mental status.
   .
   #.  Altered mental status.  Given supratherapeutic lamictal level, and
   h/o suicide attempts, ingestion is most likely etiology.  MRI showed no
   infarct.  LP results from OSH unremarkable.  All tox screens negative.
   Hepatitis C positive, but ammonia normal. Currently undergoing 24-hr
   EEG with dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures.  Now waking
   up but with agitation. Getting prn haldol.  Appreciate neurology input.

   ICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient with the medical ICU residents, the
   assessment and plan was discussed and is detailed above.  I would add
   and emphasize the following.
   Patient more alert this am, pleasant.  Didn
t recall meeting us from
   yesterday, knows she is in the [**Hospital1 5**].  Denies pain, SOB.
   Lungs CTA Abdomen soft, good BS No edema
   As above, etiology of here unresponsiveness likely secondary to
   lamictal overdose.  Appreciate input from neurology and psychiatry
   services.  Preliminary read on EEG is not seizure activity, will
   confirm with neuro and discontinue dilantin.  Agree with sitter
   awaiting inpatient  placement for psychiatric care.
   Time spent:  25 minutes

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and bipolar disorder, who was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. She has a supratherapeutic lamictal level, and her medical history suggests multiple prior suicide attempts. The patient is currently undergoing 24-hour EEG with dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures. She is experiencing agitation and is receiving prn haldol. The patient's respiratory status is stable, and her hypotension has resolved. She is being treated for hyperglycemia and has a history of hepatitis C. The patient is also being managed for aspiration pneumonia and hyperlipidemia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Lamictal overdose: The patient's supratherapeutic lamictal level poses a risk of further complications, including seizures, coma, and death.
2. Intermittent seizures: The patient's EEG is pending, and the preliminary read suggests no seizure activity. However, the patient's history of seizures and the presence of dilantin load for possible intermittent seizures pose a risk of seizure activity.
3. Agitation: The patient's agitation is being managed with prn haldol, but the patient's history of bipolar disorder and multiple prior suicide attempts suggests a high risk of suicidal behavior.
4. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but the presence of aspiration pneumonia poses a risk of respiratory failure and death.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved, but the patient's history of hypertension and the presence of medications that can cause hypotension (e.g., lamictal) pose a risk of recurrent hypotension.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia is being managed with insulin, but the patient's history of diabetes and the presence of medications that can cause hyperglycemia (e.g., lamictal) pose a risk of recurrent hyperglycemia.
7. Hepatitis C: The patient's hepatitis C is being managed with antiviral therapy, but the patient's history of liver disease and the presence of medications that can cause liver damage (e.g., lamictal) pose a risk of liver failure.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is being managed with statin therapy, but the patient's history of hyperlipidemia and the presence of medications that can cause hyperlipidemia (e.g., lamictal) pose a risk of recurrent hyperlipidemia.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition and history of multiple comorbidities pose a high risk of medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or mitigate these complications."
