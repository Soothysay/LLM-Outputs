 ACUTE ON CHRONIC DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   Assessment and Plan: 84 year old female with CAD, dCHF, COPD,
   hypothyroidism, and [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for post-op hypotension
   s/p iliocecectomy and sigmoid colectomy for colon adenoCA.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely related to intraoperative blood loss and sedation
   since was not hypotensive pre-operatively. Would also consider intraop
   myocardial ischemia as possible etiology with decreased cardiac output,
   however EKG shows stable LBBB, with negative Scarbosa criteria.
   Developing sepsis also a consideration or intraoperative
   infection/perforation so will empirically treat for possible sepsis.
   She has not had leukocytosis or fevers but has been relatively
   hypothermic.
   - Transfusion goal of HCT>27 given h/o CAD
   - wean off dobutamine to avoid increased risk arrhythmia
   - trend biomarkers
 negative thus far
   - wean off propofol in preparation for SBT
   - wean off neosynephrine
   - maintain UOP>0.5cc/kg/hr
   - f/u blood and urine cx
   - Touch base with surgery team
   .
   # Anemia: Likely related to blood loss from surgery and known
   malignancy although estimated blood loss minimal and may also be partly
   secondary to hemodilution since received 3L IVF intraop.
   - check HCT Q8H, tx HCT<27 or active bleed
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient remains intubated after procedure
   secondary to hemodynamic instability and not because of respiratory
   failure. Pt seemed to tolerate PEEP of 0 which seemed to suggest acute
   dCHF not a significant factor on respiratory status.
   - decrease FiO2 now, decrease sedation and change over to PSV as
   tolerated
   - wean off propofol
   - SBT today with goal for extubation
   .
   # Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Pt with significant volume overload
   on CXR after 3L LR and 2 units PRBCs.
   -Since no significant affect on respiratory status, will hold off on
   diuresis for now given weaning neo today
   -Consider diuresis tonight or tomorrow if more stable and will discuss
   with surgery first

   # PAF: Currently sinus with LBBB on PO amio at baseline. Has not been
   anticoagulated in past for unclear reasons, ? [**1-10**] GIB.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, with several potential medical complications.

The patient's hypotension is likely related to intraoperative blood loss, sedation, and possibly intraoperative myocardial ischemia. The patient has a history of CAD and dCHF, which may contribute to her hypotension. The patient's anemia is likely related to blood loss from surgery and known malignancy.

The patient remains intubated due to hemodynamic instability, and her respiratory failure is secondary to this instability rather than a primary respiratory issue. The patient's acute on chronic diastolic CHF is evident on CXR, with significant volume overload.

The patient has a history of PAF, which is currently in sinus rhythm with LBBB, and is being treated with amiodarone. Her hypothyroidism is being managed with levothyroxine.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypothermia and relative bradycardia may indicate the development of sepsis, which would require empirical treatment.
2. Intraoperative infection or perforation: The patient's hypotension and hemodynamic instability may be related to an intraoperative infection or perforation, which would require further evaluation and treatment.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of CAD and PAF, as well as her current treatment with amiodarone, may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she is not weaned off sedation and intubation, which could lead to respiratory distress or arrest.
5. Volume overload: The patient's acute on chronic diastolic CHF may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased congestion and potential cardiac failure.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of colon adenocarcinoma and recent surgery may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, which could lead to hypovolemic shock or cardiac arrest.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, close monitoring and management are essential to prevent these potential complications and ensure her optimal care."

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Assessment and Plan: 84 year old female with CAD, dCHF, COPD,
   hypothyroidism, and [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for post-op hypotension
   s/p iliocecectomy and sigmoid colectomy for colon adenoCA.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely related to intraoperative blood loss and sedation
   since was not hypotensive pre-operatively. Would also consider intraop
   myocardial ischemia as possible etiology with decreased cardiac
   output.  Developing sepsis also a consideration or intraoperative
   infection/perforation so will empirically treat for possible sepsis.
   She has not had leukocytosis or fevers but has been relatively
   hypothermic.
   - Transfuse 2 units [**Hospital Unit Name **] now, repeat post-transfusion HCT
   - wean off dobutamine to avoid increased risk arrhythmia
   - trend biomarkers
   - if remains hypotensive after fluid repletion and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] change
   propofol to fentanyl/versed to decrease hypotension but would ideally
   want to extubate in the morning so would not want long acting sedation
   - continue neo, titrate to MAP>65
   - maintain UOP>0.5cc/kg/hr
   - consider TTE in am
   - empiric unasyn for now for possible infection
   - trend CvO2 sat, lactate
   .
   # Anemia: Likely related to blood loss from surgery and known
   malignancy although estimated blood loss minimal and may also be partly
   secondary to hemodilution since received 3L IVF intraop.
   - transfuse 2 units [**First Name3 (LF) **] now,

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU following a post-operative hypotension episode after undergoing an iliocecectomy and sigmoid colectomy for colon adenocarcinoma. She has a history of CAD, dCHF, COPD, hypothyroidism, and unknown allergies. The patient is currently sedated and intubated, and is receiving multiple infusions, including amiodarone, propofol, and pantoprazole. Her vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 117/40 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, and respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 94%, and her mixed venous oxygen saturation is 74-74%.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL, and an elevated white blood cell count of 5.3 K/uL. Her creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dL, and her lactate level is 1.3 mmol/L.

The patient's medical conditions include hypotension, anemia, respiratory failure, and possible sepsis. The plan is to transfuse two units of blood, wean off dobutamine, and trend biomarkers. The patient's sedation will be weaned off, and she will be extubated in the morning if possible.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection. The patient is at risk for developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. If the patient's respiratory status deteriorates, she may require further interventions, such as non-invasive ventilation or tracheostomy.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD and is receiving amiodarone, which can cause cardiac arrhythmias. The patient is also at risk for developing cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiogenic shock.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient has undergone surgery and has received blood transfusions. She is at risk for bleeding complications, such as hemorrhage or hematoma.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated lactate level, which may indicate an electrolyte imbalance. The patient is at risk for developing electrolyte imbalances, such as hyperkalemia or hypokalemia.
6. Infection: The patient has undergone surgery and has received blood transfusions. She is at risk for developing infections, such as surgical site infections or bloodstream infections.
7. Organ failure: The patient is at risk for developing organ failure, such as renal failure or hepatic failure, due to her underlying medical conditions and the potential for complications related to her surgery and hospitalization."

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Assessment and Plan: 84 year old female with CAD, dCHF, COPD,
   hypothyroidism, and [**Hospital **] transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for post-op hypotension
   s/p iliocecectomy and sigmoid colectomy for colon adenoCA.
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely related to intraoperative blood loss and sedation
   since was not hypotensive pre-operatively. Would also consider intraop
   myocardial ischemia as possible etiology with decreased cardiac
   output.  Developing sepsis also a consideration or intraoperative
   infection/perforation so will empirically treat for possible sepsis.
   She has not had leukocytosis or fevers but has been relatively
   hypothermic.
   - Transfuse 2 units [**Hospital Unit Name **] now, repeat post-transfusion HCT
   - wean off dobutamine to avoid increased risk arrhythmia
   - trend biomarkers
   - if remains hypotensive after fluid repletion and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] change
   propofol to fentanyl/versed to decrease hypotension but would ideally
   want to extubate in the morning so would not want long acting sedation
   - continue neo, titrate to MAP>65
   - maintain UOP>0.5cc/kg/hr
   - consider TTE in am
   - empiric unasyn for now for possible infection
   - trend CvO2 sat, lactate
   .
   # Anemia: Likely related to blood loss from surgery and known
   malignancy although estimated blood loss minimal and may also be partly
   secondary to hemodilution since received 3L IVF intraop.
   - transfuse 2 units [**First Name3 (LF) **] now,
   - check HCT q8, tx HCT<27 or active bleed
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Patient remains intubated after procedure
   secondary to hemodynamic instability and not because of respiratory
   failure. Currently on SIMV Vt 500 RR 12, FiO2 80% with ABG 7.39/49/220
   - decrease FiO2 now, decrease sedation and change over to PSV as
   tolerated
   - SBT in am with goal for extubation
   .
   # PAF: Currently sinus with LBBB on PO amio at baseline. Has not been
   anticoagulated in past for unclear reasons, ? [**1-10**] GIB.
   - amio gtt at 0.5mg/hr since not taking POs
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue levothyroxine
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete potassium and other electrolytes, NPO for now,
   possible extubation in am

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a post-operative partial bowel resection patient who was extubated yesterday and was experiencing chest pain and difficulty breathing this morning. They were given additional Lasix and morphine, and an ECG was done, but the results are inconclusive due to a left bundle branch block (LBBB). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 128/48 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient has a history of anemia, atrial fibrillation, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of partial bowel resection and recent extubation may increase their risk of respiratory failure, especially if they develop pneumonia or another respiratory infection.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism may increase their risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Infection: The patient's history of anemia and recent surgery may increase their risk of infection, particularly in the surgical site or in the respiratory tract.
4. Bleeding: The patient's history of partial bowel resection and recent surgery may increase their risk of bleeding, particularly in the abdominal cavity.
5. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's history of anemia and recent surgery may increase their risk of nutritional deficiencies, particularly in iron or vitamin deficiencies.
6. Wound complications: The patient's history of partial bowel resection and recent surgery may increase their risk of wound complications, such as infection, dehiscence, or hernia.
7. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism may increase their risk of cardiovascular instability, particularly in response to changes in blood pressure or heart rate.

Based on this information, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and cardiac function, and to provide supportive care to manage any potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female who underwent a partial bowel resection (iliocecectomy and sigmoid colectomy) for colon adenocarcinoma. She was transferred to the ICU due to post-operative hypotension. The patient is currently extubated but on a face mask with 70% FiO2 due to hypoxemia. Her CXR shows worsened atelectasis and a left-sided effusion. She has a history of CAD, dCHF, COPD, hypothyroidism, and colon cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxemia and worsening atelectasis on CXR may indicate a risk of respiratory failure.
2. Heart Failure: The patient's history of chronic heart failure and the development of acute diastolic heart failure may lead to worsening cardiac function.
3. Sepsis: The patient's low threshold to treat with antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and the presence of crackles on lung examination suggest a risk of sepsis.
4. Anemia: The patient's acute anemia secondary to blood loss may require transfusions.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism may require close monitoring and treatment.
6. Cancer: The patient's history of colon cancer and the pending biopsy results may indicate a risk of recurrence or metastasis.
7. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's prophylactic SQ UF heparin for DVT prophylaxis may be necessary due to her immobilization in the ICU.
8. Stress Ulcer: The patient's risk of stress ulcer bleeding may require prophylaxis.
9. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's use of invasive ventilation may increase her risk of VAP.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
2. Monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust diuretic therapy as needed.
3. Administer antibiotics if HAP is suspected and monitor for signs of sepsis.
4. Transfuse blood products as necessary to maintain a hematocrit of >27%.
5. Continue levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.
6. Consider prophylactic antibiotics for DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis.
7. Monitor for signs of VAP and consider antibiotic therapy if necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's cancer status and consider further treatment options as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female who underwent a partial bowel resection and is currently in the ICU. She was extubated but is still receiving oxygen via a face mask at 70% FiO2. Her chest x-ray shows worsened atelectasis and a left-sided effusion. She has a history of CAD, dCHF, COPD, hypothyroidism, and colon cancer.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 128/48 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 15 inspirations per minute, and her SpO2 is 92%. She has a first-degree atrioventricular block and a central venous pressure of 5 mmHg.

The patient's lab results show anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL and a hematocrit of 31.9%. Her white blood cell count is 5.3 K/uL, and her platelet count is 126 K/uL. Her troponin-T level is 0.06 ng/mL, and her creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 92% on a face mask at 70% FiO2, which may indicate hypoxemia.
2. HAP: The patient has a low threshold to treat with antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable to elevated, but she has a history of hypotension.
4. Heart failure: The patient has a history of chronic heart failure and is at risk for acute decompensation.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia secondary to blood loss, and her hemoglobin level is 9.8 g/dL.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which may require anticoagulation therapy.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which requires continued levothyroxine therapy.
8. Cancer: The patient has a history of colon cancer, which may require further treatment and monitoring.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and atelectasis may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's anemia and hypotension may increase her risk of sepsis.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation and history of heart failure may increase her risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Thyroid storm: The patient's hypothyroidism may increase her risk of thyroid storm if her thyroid hormone levels are not properly managed.
5. Cancer recurrence: The patient's history of colon cancer may increase her risk of cancer recurrence."
