   Assessment and Plan
   A 54 year-ol woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Differential includes distributive (sepsis) vs cardiac
   vs adrenal insufficiency vs volume depletion.  No hypoxia to suggest
   PE, and had a negative CTA in the ED.  CVP zero currently argues
   against cardiogenic shock.  She did recently finish her steroid taper
   and could be adrenally insufficient.  Fortunately she received
   dexamethasone [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim could be evaluated.  Another possibility is
   volume depletion, possibly secondary to blood loss into her thigh.
   Most likely this is sepsis.  Most likely source is urine given positive
   urine culture and indwelling Foley.   Recently had a UTI as an
   outpatient but no culture data or information about abx course.  Last
   positive UA here [**9-30**] and [**7-31**] with resistant klebsiella (ESBL) which
   was treated with Bactrim, and enterococcus (VRE) respectively.
   - Trend lactate
   - SvO2 as she comes off pressors
   - Antibiotics: vanc + zosyn for now pending cultures
   - trend lactate
   - [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
   - Source localization (pan-culture)
   - Continue levophed MAP >60
   - IVF to keep CVP >8 ([**9-3**])
   - Continue stress dose steroids
   - change Foley
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:  Attributed to seizures by her husband and apparently
   by her neuro-oncologist, who recently increased her Keppra dosing to
   control this.  Another possibility is that she is simply
   orthostatic(given that episodes are reproducible with positional
   changes) and in the setting of worsening baseline hypotension recently
   has become more symptomatic.  CT head negative for acute change.
   - discuss with neuro-oncology if EEG monitorring might be helpful
   - check orthostatic vital signs once off pressors
   .
   # R thigh hematoma:  concerning given that she is currently on lovenox
   and hct dropped.
   - stop anticoagulation
   - follow Hct, repeat now
   - T&S
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  currently anticoagulated with lovenox.  Currently has
   evidence of R thigh bleed on CT.
   - stop anticoagulation for now
   - consider LENIs, as she may be a candidate for IVC filter if LE clots
   are present and anticoagulation contraindicated
   .
   #) Anion gap:  AG 21 on admission, improved to 14 after fluids and
   resuscitation. Likely secondary to elevated lactate (8.0).
   - continue to trend
   - IV fluids as above
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  likely secondary to demand and
   hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST depressions laterally new since
   [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Reportedly with good response.  Although
   patient attributes her episodes to seizures, these are quite possibly
   just orthostatic symptoms.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (recently increased)
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - stress dose steroids as above
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management

   .
   #) F/E/N:  NPO for now, advance diet in AM
   <br>
   #) Prophylaxis:  SC heparin, bowel regimen as needed
   <br>
   #) Communication:  with patient and husband [**Name (NI) **]:  [**Telephone/Fax (1) 4496**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension. She has a history of UTIs, including resistant Klebsiella and Enterococcus, and is currently on antibiotics. She also has a thigh hematoma and is on anticoagulation therapy with Lovenox. Her blood counts are abnormal, with a low platelet count and elevated lactate. She has elevated troponin levels, likely due to demand and hypotension. She is also experiencing episodic loss of consciousness, which may be related to seizures or orthostatic hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, elevated lactate, and abnormal blood counts suggest the possibility of sepsis. The source of infection is likely the urinary tract, given the positive urine culture and indwelling Foley catheter.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's recent steroid taper and history of CNS lymphoma make adrenal insufficiency a possibility.
3. Volume Depletion: The patient's hypotension and abnormal blood counts could be due to volume depletion, possibly secondary to blood loss into her thigh.
4. Cardiogenic Shock: Although the CVP is zero, the patient's hypotension and elevated troponin levels suggest the possibility of cardiogenic shock.
5. Compartment Syndrome: The patient's thigh hematoma and history of anticoagulation therapy with Lovenox make compartment syndrome a concern.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient's abnormal blood gases and need for oxygen therapy suggest the possibility of respiratory failure.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of seizures and recent increase in Keppra dosing make neurological complications a concern.
8. Infection: The patient's abnormal blood counts and elevated lactate suggest the possibility of infection, which could be secondary to the urinary tract or other sources.
9. Bleeding: The patient's thigh hematoma and history of anticoagulation therapy with Lovenox make bleeding a concern.
10. Organ Failure: The patient's abnormal blood counts and elevated lactate suggest the possibility of organ failure, including renal or hepatic failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   A 54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Now off levophed and maintaining MAP >65 with IVF
   boluses.  Lactate trending down.  Differential remains broad.  Cardiac
   seems less likely given persistently low CVPs, clear lungs.   However,
   relatively low [**Name (NI) 9144**] argues toward cardiac.   Adrenal insufficiency
   still possible given recent completion of steroid taper. CTA negative
   for PE.  Sepsis still most likely, urine is one obvious culprit, but R
   thigh hematoma could also be a source.  In [**2196**] had ESBL klebsiella and
   [**Last Name (LF) 1591**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] would be concerned for these pathogens again.  Foley has been
   changed.  Regarding management, we have fallen behind this morning in
   that CVP and UOP are less than ideal.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for now pending cultures (would not
   broaden to cover above-mentioned pathogens unless clinically unstable
   or positive culture data; could consider Bactrim if klebsiella, as ESBL
   klebsiella previously treated with this)
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 45**] stim; stress-dose steroids if adrenally insufficient.
   - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >30 cc/h:
   bolus 2L now
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma:   Seen on CT in the ED.  Patient intermittently
   endorses pain in the area.  Appears small, but hct lower on admission
   than recent baseline and she has been anticoagulated.  Now s/p 1 unit
   pRBC, Hct bumped appropriately.  concerning given that she is currently
   on lovenox and hct dropped.   Could potentially be a source of
   infection.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct
   - T&S
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - restart Lovenox 80 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider LENI, although unlikely to affect management as no evidence
   of PE and thus no indication for IVC filter
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  likely secondary to demand and
   hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST depressions laterally new since
   [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   #) Anion gap:  AG 21 on admission, likely secondary to elevated lactate
   (8.0), now resolved..
   - continue to trend
   - IV fluids as above
   .
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (recently increased)
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - completed decadron taper; consider stress-dose steroids PRN adrenal
   insufficiency
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management
   <br>
   .
   #) F/E/N:  restart regular diet (tolerates at home per husband,
   aggressive electrolyte repletion
   <br>
   #) Prophylaxis:  SC heparin, bowel regimen as needed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma who presents with hypotension. The patient has been treated with levophed and is currently off it, with MAPs >65. The differential diagnosis is broad, with sepsis being the most likely cause, possibly due to a urinary tract infection or a thigh hematoma.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac insufficiency: The patient's low CVP and low blood pressure suggest that cardiac insufficiency may be a possibility.
2. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has recently completed a steroid taper, and the possibility of adrenal insufficiency should be considered.
3. Sepsis: The patient's low blood pressure and elevated lactate levels suggest that sepsis may be a possibility.
4. Thigh hematoma: The patient has a thigh hematoma that may be a source of infection.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of DVT and PE, and anticoagulation should be restarted.
6. Anion gap: The patient's anion gap is elevated, which may be secondary to elevated lactate levels.
7. Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, which may be secondary to demand and hypotension.

The plan of care includes:

1. Continuing vancomycin and zosyn for now pending cultures.
2. Stress-dose steroids if adrenal insufficiency is suspected.
3. Monitoring for signs of compartment syndrome in the thigh hematoma.
4. Restarting Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.
5. Considering LENI for PE prophylaxis.
6. Trending cardiac enzymes and repeating EKG in the morning.
7. Continuing IV fluids to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, and urine output >30 cc/h.
8. Restarting regular diet and aggressive electrolyte repletion.
9. Continuing keppra, modafinil, and citalopram for CNS lymphoma treatment.
10. Discussing further management with Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 810].

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU for now."

   volume depletion, possibly secondary to blood loss into her thigh.
   Most likely this is sepsis.  Most likely source is urine given positive
   urine culture and indwelling Foley.   Recently had a UTI as an
   outpatient but no culture data or information about abx course.  Last
   positive UA here [**9-30**] and [**7-31**] with resistant klebsiella (ESBL) which

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma, currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after whole brain radiation. She is admitted to the ICU with hypotension, and the differential diagnosis includes distributive (sepsis) vs cardiac vs adrenal insufficiency vs volume depletion.

The patient's current status is:

* Vital signs: T 36.5°C, HR 99 bpm, BP 98/64 mmHg, RR 14 inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%
* Physical examination: appears well, sitting up, awake and alert, with no CVA tenderness and sensation intact
* Lab results: WBC 13.1 K/uL, Hct 22.1%, Plt 206 K/uL, Cr 0.5 mg/dL, TCO2 18 mmol/L, Glucose 120 mg/dL, and other lab results within normal limits

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's positive urine culture and indwelling Foley catheter, sepsis is a possibility, and the patient is being treated with vanc + zosyn antibiotics pending cultures.
2. Thigh hematoma: The patient has a concerning thigh hematoma, which may be related to her anticoagulation therapy with lovenox. The patient's Hct has dropped, and anticoagulation should be stopped, and the patient should be monitored for signs of compartment syndrome.
3. Anion gap: The patient's anion gap is elevated, likely secondary to elevated lactate. The patient should continue to be monitored, and IV fluids should be continued as above.
4. Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, likely secondary to demand and hypotension. The patient's cardiac enzymes should be trended, and a repeat EKG should be performed in the morning.
5. Orthostatic hypotension: The patient's episodes of loss of consciousness may be related to orthostatic hypotension, and the patient should be monitored for this.
6. Volume depletion: The patient's hypotension may be related to volume depletion, possibly secondary to blood loss into her thigh.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Trend lactate
* SvO2 monitoring as she comes off pressors
* Antibiotics: vanc + zosyn for now pending cultures
* Source localization (pan-culture)
* Continue levophed MAP >60
* IVF to keep CVP >8
* Continue stress dose steroids
* Change Foley
* Stop anticoagulation
* Follow Hct, repeat now
* T&S
* Monitor for signs of compartment syndrome
* Consider IVC filter if LE clots are present and anticoagulation contraindicated
* Continue to trend anion gap
* Continue IV fluids as above
* Repeat EKG in the morning
* Continue keppra 1000 mg, modafinil, and citalopram
* Stress dose steroids as above
* Discuss with Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 810] further management

The patient's code status is full code, and she is to be monitored in the ICU for now."

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   A 54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Now off levophed and maintaining MAP >65 with IVF
   boluses.  Lactate trending down.  Differential remains broad.  Cardiac
   seems less likely given persistently low CVPs, clear lungs.
   Possible sources:  proctitis, effusion, thigh
   However, relatively low [**Name (NI) 9144**] argues toward cardiac.   Adrenal
   insufficiency still possible given recent completion of steroid taper.
   CTA negative for PE.  Sepsis still most likely given that leukocytosis
   with left shift improved with antibiotics, urine is one obvious
   culprit, but R thigh hematoma could also be a source.  In [**2196**] had ESBL
   klebsiella and [**Last Name (LF) 1591**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] would be concerned for these pathogens again.
   Foley has been changed.  Regarding management, we have fallen behind
   this morning in that CVP and UOP are less than ideal.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for now pending cultures (would not
   broaden to cover above-mentioned pathogens unless clinically unstable
   or positive culture data; could consider Bactrim if klebsiella, as ESBL
   klebsiella previously treated with this)
   - re-send urine culture although unlikely to be posibitve
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 45**] stim; stress-dose steroids if adrenally insufficient.
   - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >30 cc/h:
   bolus 2L now
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma:   Seen on CT in the ED.  Patient intermittently
   endorses pain in the area.  Appears small, but hct lower on admission
   than recent baseline and she has been anticoagulated.  Now s/p 1 unit
   pRBC, Hct bumped appropriately.  concerning given that she is currently
   on lovenox and hct dropped.   Could potentially be a source of
   infection.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct
   - T&S
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - restart Lovenox 80 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider LENI, although unlikely to affect management as no evidence
   of PE and thus no indication for IVC filter
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   #) Anion gap:  AG 21 on admission, likely secondary to elevated lactate
   (8.0), now resolved..
   - continue to trend
   - IV fluids as above
   .
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (recently increased)
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - completed decadron taper; consider stress-dose steroids PRN adrenal
   insufficiency

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   A 54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Now off levophed and maintaining MAP >65 with IVF
   boluses.  Lactate trending down.  Differential remains broad.  Cardiac
   seems less likely given persistently low CVPs, clear lungs.
   Possible sources:  proctitis, effusion, thigh
   However, relatively low [**Name (NI) 9144**] argues toward cardiac.   Adrenal
   insufficiency still possible given recent completion of steroid taper.
   CTA negative for PE.  Sepsis still most likely given that leukocytosis
   with left shift improved with antibiotics, urine is one obvious
   culprit, but R thigh hematoma could also be a source.  In [**2196**] had ESBL
   klebsiella and [**Last Name (LF) 1591**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] would be concerned for these pathogens again.
   Foley has been changed.  Regarding management, we have fallen behind
   this morning in that CVP and UOP are less than ideal.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn for now pending cultures (would not
   broaden to cover above-mentioned pathogens unless clinically unstable
   or positive culture data; could consider Bactrim if klebsiella, as ESBL
   klebsiella previously treated with this)
   - re-send urine culture although unlikely to be posibitve
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 45**] stim; stress-dose steroids if adrenally insufficient.
   - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >30 cc/h:
   bolus 2L now
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma:   Seen on CT in the ED.  Patient intermittently
   endorses pain in the area.  Appears small, but hct lower on admission
   than recent baseline and she has been anticoagulated.  Now s/p 1 unit
   pRBC, Hct bumped appropriately.  concerning given that she is currently
   on lovenox and hct dropped.   Could potentially be a source of
   infection.
   - [**Hospital1 **] hct
   - T&S
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - restart Lovenox 80 mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - consider LENI, although unlikely to affect management as no evidence
   of PE and thus no indication for IVC filter
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM
   .
   #) Anion gap:  AG 21 on admission, likely secondary to elevated lactate
   (8.0), now resolved..
   - continue to trend
   - IV fluids as above
   .
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] (recently increased)
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - completed decadron taper; consider stress-dose steroids PRN adrenal
   insufficiency
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma, currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after whole brain radiation. She presents with hypotension, and the differential diagnosis includes sepsis, proctitis, effusion, and thigh hematoma. The patient has been on antibiotics, and the urine culture is pending. The patient's condition has been stable, with a decreasing lactate trend and improving leukocytosis with left shift.

The patient has several potential complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis is likely to be caused by a urinary tract infection, but the thigh hematoma could also be a source. The patient's leukocytosis with left shift has improved with antibiotics, but the urine culture is pending.
2. Thigh hematoma: The patient has a hematoma in the right buttock and right obturator externus muscle, which could potentially be a source of infection. The patient has been anticoagulated, and her hemoglobin has decreased.
3. Proctitis: The patient has mild rectal wall thickening, which could be consistent with proctitis.
4. Effusion: The patient has a small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.
5. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has been on steroids, and her recent completion of steroid taper raises the possibility of adrenal insufficiency.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on anticoagulation. The patient's left leg is larger than the right, which could be a sign of recurrent DVT.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Continuing antibiotics for sepsis.
2. Re-starting urine culture.
3. Stress-dose steroids if adrenal insufficiency is suspected.
4. Monitoring for signs of compartment syndrome in the thigh.
5. Restarting Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis.
6. Trending cardiac enzymes and repeating EKG.
7. Continuing IV fluids to maintain MAP >65 and CVP >8.
8. Restarting regular diet and aggressive electrolyte repletion.
9. Restarting prophylactic heparin and bowel regimen as needed.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU for now."

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   A 54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Falling hematocrit:  Concerning for bleed.  She has been
   anticoagulated with lovenox for hx DVT/PE, and anticoagulation was
   re-started yesterday.  Possible source would be R thigh given known
   hematoma. Also she complains of mild abdominal pain so we would be
   concerned for GI source.
   - 1 unit pRBC this morning
   - stop anticoagulation
   - q6h Hct
   - repeat CT without contrast to evaluate for interval progression of
   hematoma
   - guaiac stools
   - check hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Remains off pressors, able to maintain MAP mostly >70
   with IVF boluses.  Unable to raise CVP despite multiple boluses and
   good UOP.  Regarding cause,  no evidence of adrenal insufficiency by
   [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim yesterday.  Sepsis remains most likely but blood loss also
   high on the differential for her hypotension.  Regarding source of
   sepsis, urine culture was contaminated but probably still the most
   likely source given indwelling Foley and positive UA on admission.
   Repeat UA will likely be negative given antibiotics.  Her proctitis
   visualized on CT could also potentially be a source if infectious.
   Finally, her R obturator hematoma could be infected, or the
   questionable mass could be a source.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - re-send urine culture although unlikely to be positive
   - no need for further steroids
    - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >50 cc/h
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma/mass:   Seen on CT in the ED.  We are concerned
   that this may be a source of bleeding and/or infection.
   - monitor hct, stop anticoagulation, repeat CT as above
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - stop anticoagulation as above
   - LENIs
   - if persistent clot, may consider IVC filter given contraindication to
   anticoagulation and history of PE
   .
   #) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  more than expected as
   compensation for mild respiratory alkalosis.  Most likely secondary to
   large volume of NS resuscitation.
   - change to LR boluses rather than NS
   - urine lytes if persists
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM.
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Recently completed decadron taper.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - no further steroids
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   A 54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Falling hematocrit:  Concerning for bleed.  She has been
   anticoagulated with lovenox for hx DVT/PE, and anticoagulation was
   re-started yesterday.  Possible source would be R thigh given known
   hematoma. Also she complains of mild abdominal pain so we would be
   concerned for GI source.
   - 1 unit pRBC this morning
   - stop anticoagulation
   - q6h Hct
   - repeat CT without contrast to evaluate for interval progression of
   hematoma
   - guaiac stools
   - check hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Remains off pressors, able to maintain MAP mostly >70
   with IVF boluses.  Unable to raise CVP despite multiple boluses and
   good UOP.  Regarding cause,  no evidence of adrenal insufficiency by
   [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim yesterday.  Sepsis remains most likely but blood loss also
   high on the differential for her hypotension.  Regarding source of
   sepsis, urine culture was contaminated but probably still the most
   likely source given indwelling Foley and positive UA on admission.
   Repeat UA will likely be negative given antibiotics.  Her proctitis
   visualized on CT could also potentially be a source if infectious.
   Finally, her R obturator hematoma could be infected, or the
   questionable mass could be a source.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - re-send urine culture although unlikely to be positive
   - no need for further steroids
    - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >50 cc/h
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma/mass:   Seen on CT in the ED.  We are concerned
   that this may be a source of bleeding and/or infection.
   - monitor hct, stop anticoagulation, repeat CT as above
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - stop anticoagulation as above
   - LENIs
   - if persistent clot, may consider IVC filter given contraindication to
   anticoagulation and history of PE
   .
   #) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  more than expected as
   compensation for mild respiratory alkalosis.  Most likely secondary to
   large volume of NS resuscitation.
   - change to LR boluses rather than NS
   - urine lytes if persists
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM.
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Recently completed decadron taper.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - no further steroids
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma who presents with hypotension, falling hematocrit, and sepsis. She has been anticoagulated with lovenox for a history of DVT/PE and has a known hematoma in her right thigh. She also has a mild abdominal pain and a new small-to-moderate left pleural effusion.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, and blood pressure of 88/48 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.

The patient's physical examination is significant for a right thigh hematoma, mild epigastric tenderness, and suprapubic tenderness. Her neurologic examination is intact, with 4/5 strength of her bilateral lower extremity flexors and extensors.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.1 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 149 x 10^9/L. Her blood cultures are negative, and her urine culture is contaminated. Her CT scan shows a probable hematoma in her right buttock and right obturator externus muscle, as well as diffuse osteopenia and mild rectal wall thickening.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Stopping anticoagulation and restarting it only if bleeding stops.
2. Monitoring her hematocrit and repeating CT scans to evaluate for interval progression of the hematoma.
3. Checking for hemolysis labs and guaiac stools.
4. Continuing vancomycin and zosyn for sepsis.
5. Repeating urine culture and sending it to the laboratory.
6. Monitoring her CVP and urine output to ensure they are within normal limits.
7. Continuing IVF to maintain her blood pressure and urine output.
8. Monitoring her neurologic status and considering EEG monitoring if her hypotension persists.
9. Stopping anticoagulation and considering an IVC filter if she develops a recurrent DVT.
10. Changing to LR boluses rather than NS to manage her non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Bleeding from the right thigh hematoma, which could be exacerbated by anticoagulation.
2. Infection of the right thigh hematoma, which could lead to sepsis.
3. Compartment syndrome in the right thigh, which could lead to nerve damage or muscle necrosis.
4. Recurrent DVT, which could lead to pulmonary embolism.
5. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which could lead to worsening of her respiratory status.
6. Elevated troponin levels, which could indicate cardiac damage or stress.
7. Seizure activity, which could be related to her CNS lymphoma or other underlying conditions.
8. Infection of the right obturator hematoma, which could lead to sepsis.

The patient's medical plan should be closely monitored to prevent these complications and ensure her safe and effective management."

   time, although unclear exactly what we
re treating.  Furthermore, Zosyn
   may be contributing to thrombocytopenia.

   #)  R thigh hematoma/mass:  On repeat CT yesterday, mass has not
   enlarged.  However, it is substantial in size.
   - monitor hct
   - no anticoagulation for now
   - discuss with radiology whether this is a true bleed (vs underlying
   mass?)  and how significant it is
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   #) Falling hematocrit:  Anticoagulation stopped yesterday out of
   concern for bleed.  Hct bumped appropriately to 1 unit pRBC and has

   source).

   #) Thrombocytopenia:  concerning for DIC vs HIT.  Fibrinogen on admit
   slightly low.   She has been getting heparin since admit (on and off)
   but had been on lovenox chronically, so HIT less likely.  Fibrinogen
   was somewhat low last time it was checked 2 days ago.
   - check DIC labs
   - replete fibrinogen with cryo PRN

   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.

   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - no anticoagulation for now
   - LENIs
   - discuss re-challenge with heparin vs possible IVC filter given
   ongoing risk for VTE and possible contra-indication to anticoagulation
   .
   #) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  more than expected as
   compensation for mild respiratory alkalosis.  Most likely secondary to
   large volume of NS resuscitation.
   - LR boluses
   - urine lytes if persists
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   #) Hypotension:  Now off pressors x 3 days and able to maintain MAP
   mostly >70 with IVF boluses.  Unable to raise CVP despite multiple
   boluses and good UOP.  Regarding cause, no evidence of adrenal
   insufficiency by [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim yesterday.  Sepsis remains most likely but
   blood loss also high on the differential for her hypotension.
   Regarding source of sepsis, urine culture was contaminated but probably
   still the most likely source given indwelling Foley and positive UA on
   admission.  Repeat UA has expectedly  been negative given antibiotics.
   Her proctitis visualized on CT could also potentially be a source if
   infectious.  Finally, her R obturator hematoma could be infected, or
   the questionable mass could be a source.  She has been on vancomycin
   and zosyn and improving, so it would be difficult to stop abx at this

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma, who presented with hypotension and was diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. She has a right obturator hematoma and a questionable mass on CT scan, which may be infected. She has been treated with vancomycin and zosyn, and her blood cultures are pending. Her thrombocytopenia is concerning for DIC or HIT, and she has been given heparin prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding from the hematoma: The patient has a significant right obturator hematoma, which may continue to bleed and cause hypotension.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, which may progress to septic shock if not treated promptly.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is concerning for DIC or HIT, which may lead to bleeding or thrombotic complications.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of DVT/PE and is at risk for recurrent VTE.
5. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if not treated promptly.
6. Elevated troponin: The patient's elevated troponin level may indicate cardiac damage or demand, which may require further evaluation.
7. CNS lymphoma: The patient's history of CNS lymphoma may lead to complications such as seizures, cerebral edema, or spinal cord compression.

Recommendations:

1. Continue vancomycin and zosyn until blood cultures are negative.
2. Monitor the patient's hematocrit and platelet count closely.
3. Consider anticoagulation therapy for DVT/PE prophylaxis.
4. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and correct any imbalances.
5. Consider further evaluation of the patient's cardiac function, including an echocardiogram.
6. Monitor the patient's neurologic status and consider further evaluation for seizures or cerebral edema.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's blood cultures and adjust antibiotic therapy as necessary."

 .H/O PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   potential for bleeding from hematoma
   54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Now off pressors x 3 days and able to maintain MAP
   mostly >70 with IVF boluses.  Unable to raise CVP despite multiple
   boluses and good UOP.  Regarding cause, no evidence of adrenal
   insufficiency by [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim yesterday.  Sepsis remains most likely but
   blood loss also high on the differential for her hypotension.
   Regarding source of sepsis, urine culture was contaminated but probably
   still the most likely source given indwelling Foley and positive UA on
   admission.  Repeat UA has expectedly  been negative given antibiotics.
   Her proctitis visualized on CT could also potentially be a source if
   infectious.  Finally, her R obturator hematoma could be infected, or
   the questionable mass could be a source.  She has been on vancomycin
   and zosyn and improving, so it would be difficult to stop abx at this
   time, although unclear exactly what we
re treating.  Furthermore, Zosyn
   may be contributing to thrombocytopenia.
   - continue vancomycin
   - change Zosyn to meropenem
   - f/u all pending cultures
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >35 cc/h
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma/mass:  On repeat CT yesterday, mass has not
   enlarged.  However, it is substantial in size.
   - monitor hct
   - no anticoagulation for now
   - discuss with radiology whether this is a true bleed (vs underlying
   mass?)  and how significant it is
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   #) Falling hematocrit:  Anticoagulation stopped yesterday out of
   concern for bleed.  Hct bumped appropriately to 1 unit pRBC and has
   remained stable.   Also complains of mild abdominal pain (? Upper GI
   source).
   - hold anticoagulation
   - q6h Hct
   - guaiac stools
   - check hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia:  concerning for DIC vs HIT.  Fibrinogen on admit
   slightly low.   She has been getting heparin since admit (on and off)
   but had been on lovenox chronically, so HIT less likely.  Fibrinogen
   was somewhat low last time it was checked 2 days ago.
   - check DIC labs
   - replete fibrinogen with cryo PRN
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - no anticoagulation for now
   - LENIs
   - discuss re-challenge with heparin vs possible IVC filter given
   ongoing risk for VTE and possible contra-indication to anticoagulation
   .
   #) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  more than expected as
   compensation for mild respiratory alkalosis.  Most likely secondary to
   large volume of NS resuscitation.
   - LR boluses
   - urine lytes if persists
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - echo today to evaluate cardiac function
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Recently completed decadron taper.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - no further steroids
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management
   <br>
   .
   #) F/E/N:  regular diet, replete lytes PRN
   <br>
   #) Prophylaxis:  pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen as needed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma who presents with hypotension, sepsis, and a large right thigh hematoma. She has been treated with vancomycin and Zosyn, but her condition remains uncertain, and multiple potential sources of sepsis are being considered.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 35.9°C (96.6°F)
* Heart rate: 71 bpm (normal range)
* Blood pressure: 107/67 mmHg (normal range)
* Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute (normal range)
* Oxygen saturation: 100% (normal range)
* Hemodynamic monitoring: CVP 1 mmHg (normal range)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 12.0 x 10^9/L (normal range)
* Hemoglobin: 9.2 g/dL (normal range)
* Platelet count: 167 x 10^9/L (low range)
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL (normal range)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 18 mg/dL (normal range)
* Glucose: 111 mg/dL (normal range)

The patient's imaging studies show:

* CT pelvis: A large hematoma in the right thigh, with a slight increase in size since the previous study. There is also a possible underlying mass.
* Abdominal CT: No evidence of free fluid or abscesses.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continuing vancomycin and changing Zosyn to meropenem
* Monitoring her hematocrit and platelet count
* Continuing IV fluids to maintain blood pressure and urine output
* Discussing with radiology whether the right thigh hematoma is a true bleed or an underlying mass
* Monitoring for signs of compartment syndrome

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Bleeding from the right thigh hematoma
* Infection of the hematoma or underlying mass
* Sepsis or septic shock
* Thrombocytopenia or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
* Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
* Elevated troponin levels
* Cardiac dysfunction or arrhythmias
* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Neurological complications, such as seizures or encephalopathy

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is currently ICU care."

 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   potential for bleeding from hematoma
   54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Falling hematocrit:  Concerning for bleed.  She has been
   anticoagulated with lovenox for hx DVT/PE, and anticoagulation was
   re-started yesterday.  Possible source would be R thigh given known
   hematoma. Also she complains of mild abdominal pain so we would be
   concerned for GI source.
   - 1 unit pRBC this morning
   - stop anticoagulation
   - q6h Hct
   - repeat CT without contrast to evaluate for interval progression of
   hematoma
   - guaiac stools
   - check hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Remains off pressors, able to maintain MAP mostly >70
   with IVF boluses.  Unable to raise CVP despite multiple boluses and
   good UOP.  Regarding cause,  no evidence of adrenal insufficiency by
   [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim yesterday.  Sepsis remains most likely but blood loss also
   high on the differential for her hypotension.  Regarding source of
   sepsis, urine culture was contaminated but probably still the most
   likely source given indwelling Foley and positive UA on admission.
   Repeat UA will likely be negative given antibiotics.  Her proctitis
   visualized on CT could also potentially be a source if infectious.
   Finally, her R obturator hematoma could be infected, or the
   questionable mass could be a source.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - re-send urine culture although unlikely to be positive
   - no need for further steroids
    - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >50 cc/h
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia:
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma/mass:   Seen on CT in the ED.  We are concerned
   that this may be a source of bleeding and/or infection.
   - monitor hct, stop anticoagulation, repeat CT as above
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - stop anticoagulation as above
   - LENIs
   - if persistent clot, may consider IVC filter given contraindication to
   anticoagulation and history of PE
   .
   #) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  more than expected as
   compensation for mild respiratory alkalosis.  Most likely secondary to
   large volume of NS resuscitation.
   - change to LR boluses rather than NS
   - urine lytes if persists
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM.
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Recently completed decadron taper.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram

   high on the differential for her hypotension.  Regarding source of
   sepsis, urine culture was contaminated but probably still the most

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma who presents with hypotension, pain, and potential bleeding from a right thigh hematoma. The patient has been anticoagulated with lovenox for a history of DVT/PE, and anticoagulation was restarted yesterday.

The patient's condition is complicated by several potential medical complications, including:

1. Bleeding from the hematoma: The patient's hematocrit has been falling, and the hematoma is still present, which increases the risk of bleeding.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a contaminated urine culture and a positive urine antigen test, which suggests that she may have a urinary tract infection. Additionally, her proctitis visualized on CT could also be a source of sepsis.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still low, and she is requiring IV fluid boluses to maintain a mean arterial pressure above 65.
5. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has a mild metabolic acidosis, which may be secondary to the large volume of normal saline resuscitation.
6. Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin level is elevated, which may be secondary to demand and hypotension.
7. CNS lymphoma: The patient has a history of CNS lymphoma, which may be affecting her overall health and increasing her risk of complications.

The patient's medical plan includes:

1. Stopping anticoagulation to reduce the risk of bleeding from the hematoma.
2. Continuing vancomycin and Zosyn to treat potential sepsis.
3. Repeating CT scans to evaluate the interval progression of the hematoma.
4. Monitoring the patient's hematocrit and platelet count to assess for bleeding and thrombocytopenia.
5. Continuing IV fluids to maintain a mean arterial pressure above 65.
6. Trending cardiac enzymes to assess for cardiac complications.
7. Discussing further management with the patient's oncologist.

The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU for now."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 .H/O PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
   potential for bleeding from hematoma
   54 year-old woman with a history of CNS lymphoma presents with
   hypotension.
   .
   #) Falling hematocrit:  Concerning for bleed.  She has been
   anticoagulated with lovenox for hx DVT/PE, and anticoagulation was
   re-started yesterday.  Possible source would be R thigh given known
   hematoma. Also she complains of mild abdominal pain so we would be
   concerned for GI source.
   - 1 unit pRBC this morning
   - stop anticoagulation
   - q6h Hct
   - repeat CT without contrast to evaluate for interval progression of
   hematoma
   - guaiac stools
   - check hemolysis labs
   .
   #) Hypotension:  Remains off pressors, able to maintain MAP mostly >70
   with IVF boluses.  Unable to raise CVP despite multiple boluses and
   good UOP.  Regarding cause,  no evidence of adrenal insufficiency by
   [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim yesterday.  Sepsis remains most likely but blood loss also
   high on the differential for her hypotension.  Regarding source of
   sepsis, urine culture was contaminated but probably still the most
   likely source given indwelling Foley and positive UA on admission.
   Repeat UA will likely be negative given antibiotics.  Her proctitis
   visualized on CT could also potentially be a source if infectious.
   Finally, her R obturator hematoma could be infected, or the
   questionable mass could be a source.
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - re-send urine culture although unlikely to be positive
   - no need for further steroids
    - f/u all culture data
   - continue IVF to maintain MAP >65, CVP >8, urine output >50 cc/h
   .
   #) Thrombocytopenia:  concerning for DIC vs HIT.  Fibrinogen on admit
   slightly low.   She has been getting heparin intermittently.
   .
   #) Episodic LOC:   None since admission.  Seems most likely to be
   orthostatic and less likely seizure activity.
   - f/u neuro-onc recs
   - continue keppra at current dosing
   - will not pursue EEG monitoring at this time, may consider if these
   persist after hypotension resolves
   .
   #)  R thigh hematoma/mass:   Seen on CT in the ED.  We are concerned
   that this may be a source of bleeding and/or infection.
   - monitor hct, stop anticoagulation, repeat CT as above
   - monitor for sx of compartment syndrome
   .
   #) hx DVT/PE:  Anticoagulation held on admission given R thigh
   hematoma.   No evidence of ongoing bleeding currently. LLE larger than
   RLE, also noted in previous clinic notes, but concerning for recurrent
   DVT (prior was in [**9-30**] in LLE)
   - stop anticoagulation as above
   - LENIs
   - if persistent clot, may consider IVC filter given contraindication to
   anticoagulation and history of PE
   .
   #) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis:  more than expected as
   compensation for mild respiratory alkalosis.  Most likely secondary to
   large volume of NS resuscitation.
   - change to LR boluses rather than NS
   - urine lytes if persists
   .
   #) Elevated troponin:  With flat CK.  Peaked at .23 and trended down.
   Likely secondary to demand and hypotension.  EKG in the ED with ST
   depressions laterally new since [**9-30**].
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat EKG in AM.
   .
   #) CNS lymphoma:  currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after
   whole brain radiation.  Recently completed decadron taper.
   - continue keppra 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prophylaxis
   - continue modafinil
   - continue citalopram
   - no further steroids
   - discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] further management

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications are potential concerns:

1. Bleeding from the hematoma: The patient's hematocrit is falling, and she has been anticoagulated with lovenox for a history of DVT/PE. The hematoma in her right thigh may be a source of bleeding, and she is at risk of further bleeding.
2. Infection of the hematoma or underlying mass: The patient has a history of CNS lymphoma and is at risk of infection. The CT pelvis shows a slight increase in size of the hematoma, and there is a possibility of persistent pelvic free fluid, which could be infected.
3. Sepsis: The patient's temperature is normal, but she has a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction. She is at risk of developing sepsis again, particularly given her indwelling Foley catheter and positive urine culture.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, and she has been receiving heparin intermittently. This may be contributing to her thrombocytopenia, and she is at risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
5. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient's urine output is high, and she has received a large volume of normal saline (NS) resuscitation. This may be contributing to her non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, and she may need to be switched to lactated Ringer's (LR) boluses.
6. Elevated troponin: The patient's troponin level is elevated, but her CK level is flat. This may be secondary to demand and hypotension, and she will need to be monitored for cardiac enzymes.
7. CNS lymphoma: The patient has a history of CNS lymphoma and is currently being treated with adjuvant Temodar after whole brain radiation. She may need to be monitored for seizure activity and may require further management with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**].

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Stopping anticoagulation and monitoring her hematocrit
* Repeating CT scans to evaluate for interval progression of the hematoma
* Monitoring for signs of compartment syndrome in her right thigh
* Continuing vancomycin and Zosyn antibiotics
* Repeating urine cultures and checking for hemolysis labs
* Monitoring her cardiac enzymes and repeating EKGs
* Continuing seizure prophylaxis with keppra
* Discussing further management with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**]"
