You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male who was intubated after a cardiac arrest. The patient has a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve, and had a possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: T 37.7°C (99.9°F), HR 85 bpm, BP 127/69 mmHg, RR 18 breaths per minute, SpO2 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is on a ventilator with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.
* Laboratory results: The patient has elevated cardiac enzymes (CK 5500 IU/L, Troponin-T 0.04 ng/mL), abnormal LFTs (ALT 109 IU/L, AST 89 IU/L), and a normal complete blood count (CBC).
* Physical examination: The patient is sedated and comfortable, with coarse breath sounds throughout the lungs, a normal heart rhythm, and a preserved ejection fraction (EF) on echocardiogram.

The patient is at risk for several medical complications, including:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is currently on telemetry monitoring. He is also taking metoprolol and simvastatin, which may increase his risk of arrhythmias.
2. Infection: The patient has a fever and is at risk for aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis due to his intubation.
3. Neurological complications: The patient is sedated and has a history of possible seizure, which may increase his risk of neurological complications.
4. Liver damage: The patient has elevated LFTs and is at risk for liver damage due to his cardiac arrest and possible ischemic hepatitis.
5. Hematuria: The patient has resolved hematuria, but may be at risk for further bleeding due to his cardiac catheterization.
6. Stress ulceration: The patient is at risk for stress ulceration due to his intubation and sedation.
7. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to his immobility and is receiving prophylactic heparin.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Cardiac catheterization to rule out CAD
2. Telemetry monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias
3. Serial ECGs and trend CE to monitor cardiac enzymes
4. Neurology consult to assess possible seizure and cortical function
5. EP consult to discuss anticoagulation for AFib
6. Hold on antibiotics for now due to lack of infiltrates on CXR and UA
7. CIWA with ativan to manage possible withdrawal
8. Trend LFTs to monitor liver damage
9. BP management to prevent further liver damage
10. ICU care to manage the patient's complex medical condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - Unclear etiology, but patient was having
   wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM. The preciptiant of the cardiac
   arrest is still unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia (VFib
   specificallY) or seizure. Stroke with AFib is another posibility, but
   we cannot assess any deficits a this time given sedation.  Also
   possible it could be ischemia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Serial ECGs
   - Trend CE
   - Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1795**]: cardiac cath today to r/o CAD
   - Neurology consult today re: ?seizure
   .
   #. CAD - Patient with normal stress test 2 weeks prior, multiple ECG
   changes (right and left bunndle as above), Trop I of 2.24 and CK of
   ~5500 with negative MBI. He does not have any risk factors, was not on
   aspirin and did not have chest pain. This makes unlikley that he has
   CAD as presenting symptom.
   - Cardiac cath today
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Trend CE
   - Serial ECGs
   - Continue Metorpolol (increased to 50mg po/ng TID)
   - On simvastatin 20mg po daily
   - No indications for ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 284**] given not known CAD and most-likley
   increased CE after CPR
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   - Plavix load given
   - Plavix 75 mg daily
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt currently with LBBB morphology, but RBBB in multiple
   ECGs at other hospital. Pt also has extensive ectopy. At this time his
   electrolytes are normal. No signs of ischemia. Dilated heart in
   echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF, bicuspid AS and mixomatous
   degeneration of mitral valve. [**Month (only) 11**] be going in and out of Atrial
   Fibrilation.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 50 mg TID for now
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   - Echcoardiogram in AM to assess for WMA
   - EP consult in AM
   - Discuss anticoagulation for AFib, poor candidate given EtOH. Will
   hold until CT scan negative.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #. Fever - Pt was found down and s/p cooling protocol. WBC was high up
   to 14,000. No signs of infection on CXR and UA clean at OSH. Concern
   for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. Given no infiltrates
   will hold on antibiotics for now. Withdrawal is another consideration.
   Febrile to 100.6 last night.
   - FU U/A
   - FU CXR
   - FU Blood cultures
   - No antibiotics for now
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse - Pt with last drink 4 days ago. Has been getting
   ativan and valium. No signs of withdrawal at this time (HR, BP
   adequte), but difficult to assess given beta-blocker and sedated.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis in the
   settinf of code and being found down.
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   .
   #. Hematuria - Resolved. Most likely traumatic after Foley placement.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve, was intubated after a cardiac arrest. He was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and LFTs, and is being treated for possible cardiac arrest, CAD, and rhythm disturbances. The patient is currently on maintenance IVF at 75ml/hr and is febrile to 100.6. He has had some runs of non-sustained Vtach overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is still unclear, and potential etiologies include arrhythmia, seizure, stroke, or ischemia.
2. CAD: The patient's cardiac catheterization today will help rule out CAD as a presenting symptom.
3. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient has a history of LBBB morphology, RBBB in multiple ECGs, and extensive ectopy. His electrolytes are normal, and he is being monitored for signs of ischemia.
4. Fever: The patient's fever is concerning for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis, and he is being monitored for signs of infection.
5. Withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and recent use of Ativan and Valium makes withdrawal a possibility, although it is difficult to assess given his sedation and beta-blocker therapy.
6. Shock Liver: The patient's LFTs are elevated, and he is being monitored for signs of shock liver or ischemic hepatitis.
7. Hematuria: The patient's hematuria has resolved, and it is likely traumatic after Foley placement.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and his treatment plan includes:

* Cardiac catheterization today to rule out CAD
* Serial ECGs and telemetry monitoring
* Trend CE and LFTs
* Neurology consult today to assess for seizure
* Echocardiogram in the morning to assess for WMA
* EP consult in the morning
* Discussion of anticoagulation for AFib, poor candidate given EtOH
* Holding antibiotics for now, pending further evaluation of infection
* Monitoring for signs of withdrawal and shock liver
* ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - Unclear etiology, but patient was having
   wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM. The preciptiant of the cardiac
   arrest is still unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia (VFib
   specificallY) or seizure. Stroke with AFib is another posibility, but
   we cannot assess any deficits a this time given sedation.  Also
   possible it could be ischemia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Serial ECGs
   - Trend CE
   - Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1795**]: cardiac cath today to r/o CAD
   - Neurology consult today re: ?seizure
   .
   #. CAD - Patient with normal stress test 2 weeks prior, multiple ECG
   changes (right and left bunndle as above), Trop I of 2.24 and CK of
   ~5500 with negative MBI. He does not have any risk factors, was not on
   aspirin and did not have chest pain. This makes unlikley that he has
   CAD as presenting symptom.
   - Cardiac cath today
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Trend CE
   - Serial ECGs
   - Continue Metorpolol (increased to 50mg po/ng TID)
   - On simvastatin 20mg po daily
   - No indications for ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 284**] given not known CAD and most-likley
   increased CE after CPR
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   - Plavix load given
   - Plavix 75 mg daily
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt currently with LBBB morphology, but RBBB in multiple
   ECGs at other hospital. Pt also has extensive ectopy. At this time his
   electrolytes are normal. No signs of ischemia. Dilated heart in
   echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF, bicuspid AS and mixomatous
   degeneration of mitral valve. [**Month (only) 11**] be going in and out of Atrial
   Fibrilation.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 50 mg TID for now
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   - Echcoardiogram in AM to assess for WMA
   - EP consult in AM
   - Discuss anticoagulation for AFib, poor candidate given EtOH. Will
   hold until CT scan negative.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #. Fever - Pt was found down and s/p cooling protocol. WBC was high up
   to 14,000. No signs of infection on CXR and UA clean at OSH. Concern
   for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. Given no infiltrates
   will hold on antibiotics for now. Withdrawal is another consideration.
   Febrile to 100.6 last night.
   - FU U/A
   - FU CXR
   - FU Blood cultures
   - No antibiotics for now
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse - Pt with last drink 4 days ago. Has been getting
   ativan and valium. No signs of withdrawal at this time (HR, BP
   adequte), but difficult to assess given beta-blocker and sedated.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis in the
   settinf of code and being found down.
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   .
   #. Hematuria - Resolved. Most likely traumatic after Foley placement.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male who was intubated following a cardiac arrest. He has a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve. He was found to have elevated cardiac enzymes and liver function tests (LFTs) after the cardiac arrest.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 500 mL. He is febrile at 100.6°F and has a white blood cell count of 11.3 K/uL.

The patient's cardiac rhythm is currently sinus rhythm, but he has had episodes of wide-complex tachycardia and atrial fibrillation in the past. He has also had episodes of ventricular fibrillation, which is a potential cause of his cardiac arrest.

The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with a bilirubin level of 1.8 mg/dL and an alkaline phosphatase level of 69 IU/L. His electrolyte levels are normal, but he has had episodes of hypokalemia in the past.

The patient's neurologic status is unclear due to sedation, but he is not following commands and is responding to pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation increases his risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, which can lead to cardiac arrest or stroke.
2. Infection: The patient's febrile state and abnormal liver function tests suggest the possibility of an infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
3. Ischemia: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and abnormal cardiac enzymes suggest the possibility of ischemia, which can lead to myocardial infarction or cardiac failure.
4. Liver failure: The patient's abnormal liver function tests and history of shock liver suggest the possibility of liver failure, which can lead to coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and death.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's mechanical ventilation and abnormal lung function tests suggest the possibility of respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and death.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Cardiac catheterization to rule out coronary artery disease
2. Neurology consult to assess for seizure activity
3. Serial ECGs to monitor for cardiac arrhythmias
4. Trending of cardiac enzymes to monitor for myocardial infarction
5. Monitoring of liver function tests to monitor for liver failure
6. Monitoring of electrolyte levels to monitor for electrolyte imbalances
7. Management of fever to prevent infection
8. Management of pain to prevent withdrawal syndrome
9. Monitoring of respiratory status to prevent respiratory failure"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - Unclear etiology, but patient was having
   wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM. The preciptiant of the cardiac
   arrest is still unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia (VFib
   specificallY) or seizure. Stroke with AFib is another posibility, but
   we cannot assess any deficits a this time given sedation.  Also
   possible it could be ischemia.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Serial ECGs
   - Trend CE
   - Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1795**]: cardiac cath today to r/o CAD
   - Neurology consult today re: ?seizure
   .
   #. CAD - Patient with normal stress test 2 weeks prior, multiple ECG
   changes (right and left bunndle as above), Trop I of 2.24 and CK of
   ~5500 with negative MBI. He does not have any risk factors, was not on
   aspirin and did not have chest pain. This makes unlikley that he has
   CAD as presenting symptom.
   - Cardiac cath today
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Trend CE
   - Serial ECGs
   - Continue Metorpolol (increased to 50mg po/ng TID)
   - On simvastatin 20mg po daily
   - No indications for ACEI/[**Last Name (un) 284**] given not known CAD and most-likley
   increased CE after CPR
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   - Plavix load given
   - Plavix 75 mg daily
   .
   #. Rhythm - Pt currently with LBBB morphology, but RBBB in multiple
   ECGs at other hospital. Pt also has extensive ectopy. At this time his
   electrolytes are normal. No signs of ischemia. Dilated heart in
   echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF, bicuspid AS and mixomatous
   degeneration of mitral valve. [**Month (only) 11**] be going in and out of Atrial
   Fibrilation.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 50 mg TID for now
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   - Echcoardiogram in AM to assess for WMA
   - EP consult in AM
   - Discuss anticoagulation for AFib, poor candidate given EtOH. Will
   hold until CT scan negative.
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #. Fever - Pt was found down and s/p cooling protocol. WBC was high up
   to 14,000. No signs of infection on CXR and UA clean at OSH. Concern
   for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. Given no infiltrates
   will hold on antibiotics for now. Withdrawal is another consideration.
   Febrile to 100.6 last night.
   - FU U/A
   - FU CXR
   - FU Blood cultures
   - No antibiotics for now
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse - Pt with last drink 4 days ago. Has been getting
   ativan and valium. No signs of withdrawal at this time (HR, BP
   adequte), but difficult to assess given beta-blocker and sedated.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis in the
   settinf of code and being found down.
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   .
   #. Hematuria - Resolved. Most likely traumatic after Foley placement.

   Code status: Full code (confirmed with wife)
   Disposition:  CCU for now, cath today<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest remains unclear, and further workup is needed to determine the etiology. The patient's history of MVP, bicuspid aortic valve, and possible seizure and cardiac arrest suggest a high risk of recurrent cardiac arrest.
2. CAD: Although the patient's stress test was normal, the patient's ECG changes, elevated Troponin, and CK levels suggest possible CAD. Further cardiac catheterization is needed to rule out CAD.
3. Rhythm Disturbances: The patient's LBBB morphology and RBBB in previous ECGs suggest a high risk of arrhythmias. The patient's electrolytes are normal, but further monitoring and serial ECGs are necessary to detect any changes.
4. Fever: The patient's fever, despite no signs of infection on CXR and UA, suggests possible aspiration PNA or pneumonitis. Further investigation, including FU U/A, CXR, and blood cultures, is necessary to determine the cause of the fever.
5. Withdrawal: The patient's history of alcohol abuse and recent cessation suggest a high risk of withdrawal syndrome. Further monitoring and consideration of CIWA with Ativan are necessary.
6. Shock Liver or Ischemic Hepatitis: The patient's LFTs are elevated, suggesting possible shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. Further monitoring and trend analysis of LFTs are necessary.
7. Hematuria: The patient's resolved hematuria is likely traumatic, but further investigation is necessary to rule out underlying kidney damage.
8. VAP: The patient's VAP prophylaxis regimen includes ranitidine, but further monitoring and adjustment of the regimen are necessary to prevent VAP.
9. ICU Care: The patient's ICU care plan includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and bowel regimen. Further monitoring and adjustment of these plans are necessary to ensure the patient's optimal care.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and further workup to determine the underlying causes of their cardiac arrest, CAD, rhythm disturbances, and other medical complications."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Neuro Recs: Though the etiology of patient's collapse and cardiac
   arrest remain unclear, primary arrythmia is of great concern. Given
   patient's history and presentation, his decreased mental status does
   not appear to be the primary event. His cardiac arrest and head trauma
   put him at significant risk for anoxic brain injury.
      - follow up CT head and neck to assess extent of trauma (rule out
   brain contusion    and delayed hemorrhage)
     - recommend continuous EEG monitoring to evaluate for nonconvulsive
   seizure   activity
      - minimize sedating medications for more accurate neurologic exams
   - EP Recs: If neuro status improves could consider EPS and then
   reconsider ICD . Continue to rate control, ASA.
   - ABG 10:30pm: (7.46/35/118 on AC Tv:500 RR: 16 PEEP: 5 Fi02: 40%). No
   vent changes made.
   - CT Head Final: Diffuse loss of [**Doctor Last Name 988**]-white differentiation with
   effacement of the sulci and ventricles. Given clinical history, this is
   likely to reflect edema secondary to anoxic brain injury. MRI is
   recommended for further characterization as clinically indicated.
   - CT Neck Final: 1. No evidence for fracture or acute malalignment
   involving the cervical spine. 2. Mild-to- moderate cervical spondylosis
   causing mild spinal canal stenosis.
   - Cxs: No growth to date, pending.
   - Increased ectopy last night. Gave 40 KCL, rechecked lytes (K 4.0).
   Improved. Early morning again with increased ectopy. Gave another 40
   KCL and increased Metroprolol to 75mg TID.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits a this time given
   unresponsiveness.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   -EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: No improvement in neuro status off sedation for 48
   hours. CT with signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or
   shift.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - FU U/A
   - FU CXR
   - FU Sputum Cultures
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin/Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days;
   today is day [**1-13**].
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 75mg po/ng TID
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg po daily
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission, monitor for now.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg TID for now
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Neuro Recs: Though the etiology of patient's collapse and cardiac
   arrest remain unclear, primary arrythmia is of great concern. Given
   patient's history and presentation, his decreased mental status does
   not appear to be the primary event. His cardiac arrest and head trauma
   put him at significant risk for anoxic brain injury.
      - follow up CT head and neck to assess extent of trauma (rule out
   brain contusion    and delayed hemorrhage)
     - recommend continuous EEG monitoring to evaluate for nonconvulsive
   seizure   activity
      - minimize sedating medications for more accurate neurologic exams
   - EP Recs: If neuro status improves could consider EPS and then
   reconsider ICD . Continue to rate control, ASA.
   - ABG 10:30pm: (7.46/35/118 on AC Tv:500 RR: 16 PEEP: 5 Fi02: 40%). No
   vent changes made.
   - CT Head Final: Diffuse loss of [**Doctor Last Name 988**]-white differentiation with
   effacement of the sulci and ventricles. Given clinical history, this is
   likely to reflect edema secondary to anoxic brain injury. MRI is
   recommended for further characterization as clinically indicated.
   - CT Neck Final: 1. No evidence for fracture or acute malalignment
   involving the cervical spine. 2. Mild-to- moderate cervical spondylosis
   causing mild spinal canal stenosis.
   - Cxs: No growth to date, pending.
   - Increased ectopy last night. Gave 40 KCL, rechecked lytes (K 4.0).
   Improved. Early morning again with increased ectopy. Gave another 40
   KCL and increased Metroprolol to 75mg TID.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits a this time given
   unresponsiveness.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   -EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: No improvement in neuro status off sedation for 48
   hours. CT with signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or
   shift.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - FU U/A
   - FU CXR
   - FU Sputum Cultures
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin/Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days;
   today is day [**1-13**].
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 75mg po/ng TID
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg po daily
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission, monitor for now.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg TID for now
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve, who experienced a possible seizure and cardiac arrest, leading to elevation of cardiac enzymes and liver function tests (LFTs). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for cardiac arrhythmia, anoxic brain injury, and other complications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Neurological status: The patient is unresponsive and has not improved despite being off sedation for 48 hours. A computed tomography (CT) scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.
* Cardiac status: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is currently being treated for cardiac arrhythmia. A dilated heart is seen on echocardiogram, with preserved ejection fraction (EF).
* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.
* Hemodynamic status: The patient's blood pressure is stable, and his cardiac output is adequate.
* Renal status: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is receiving fluids and diuretics to manage fluid overload.
* Hepatic status: The patient has shock liver or ischemic hepatitis, and his LFTs are trending down.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Cardiac arrhythmia: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and cardiac enzymes suggests that he may be at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias.
* Anoxic brain injury: The patient's CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury, which can lead to long-term cognitive and neurological deficits.
* Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest that he may be at risk for sepsis.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and he may require further interventions to manage his respiratory function.
* Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and fluid overload suggest that he may be at risk for renal failure.
* Hepatic failure: The patient's shock liver or ischemic hepatitis may lead to further liver dysfunction and failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring on telemetry to assess for cardiac arrhythmias.
* Continuing to manage his cardiac status with medication and close monitoring.
* Monitoring his neurological status and considering further imaging studies to assess for anoxic brain injury.
* Managing his respiratory status with mechanical ventilation and close monitoring.
* Managing his hemodynamic status with fluids and diuretics.
* Monitoring his renal status and considering further interventions to manage fluid overload.
* Monitoring his hepatic status and considering further interventions to manage shock liver or ischemic hepatitis.

The patient's family should be informed of his condition and the potential complications that can arise. They should also be educated on the importance of close monitoring and follow-up care to manage the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits a this time given
   unresponsiveness.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: No improvement in neuro status off sedation for 48
   hours. CT with signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or
   shift.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - FU U/A
   - FU CXR
   - FU Sputum Cultures
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin/Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days;
   today is day [**1-13**].
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 75mg po/ng TID
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg po daily
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission, monitor for now.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg TID for now
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:  CCU Progress Note
   Chief Complaint: Intubated s/p cardiac arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   - Neuro Recs: Though the etiology of patient's collapse and cardiac
   arrest remain unclear, primary arrythmia is of great concern. Given
   patient's history and presentation, his decreased mental status does
   not appear to be the primary event. His cardiac arrest and head trauma
   put him at significant risk for anoxic brain injury.
      - follow up CT head and neck to assess extent of trauma (rule out
   brain contusion    and delayed hemorrhage)
     - recommend continuous EEG monitoring to evaluate for nonconvulsive
   seizure   activity
      - minimize sedating medications for more accurate neurologic exams
   - EP Recs: If neuro status improves could consider EPS and then
   reconsider ICD . Continue to rate control, ASA.
   - ABG 10:30pm: (7.46/35/118 on AC Tv:500 RR: 16 PEEP: 5 Fi02: 40%). No
   vent changes made.
   - CT Head Final: Diffuse loss of [**Doctor Last Name 988**]-white differentiation with
   effacement of the sulci and ventricles. Given clinical history, this is
   likely to reflect edema secondary to anoxic brain injury. MRI is
   recommended for further characterization as clinically indicated.
   - CT Neck Final: 1. No evidence for fracture or acute malalignment
   involving the cervical spine. 2. Mild-to- moderate cervical spondylosis
   causing mild spinal canal stenosis.
   - Cxs: No growth to date, pending.
   - Increased ectopy last night with stimulation. Gave 40 KCL, rechecked
   lytes (K 4.0). Improved. Early morning again with increased ectopy.
   Gave another 40 KCL and increased Metroprolol to 75mg TID.

   Disposition: CCU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU following a cardiac arrest and possible seizure. The patient's cardiac arrest was likely caused by a primary arrhythmia, and he has a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve.

The patient's neuro status is of great concern, as he has decreased mental status, and his CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. He is at risk for anoxic brain injury due to his cardiac arrest and head trauma. The patient's EEG monitoring has been recommended to evaluate for nonconvulsive seizure activity.

The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, as he has had episodes of ectopy and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) that have responded to IV boluses of potassium. He has a dilated heart on echocardiogram with preserved ejection fraction, and his coronary arteries show minimal disease. He is being treated with metoprolol, simvastatin, and aspirin.

The patient's abdominal status is also concerning, as he has had a possible shock liver or ischemic hepatitis, and his LFTs are trending down but still slightly elevated.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 277, and he is being ventilated with a CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, with a heart rate of 95 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 116/73 mmHg.

The patient's nutritional status is being managed with repletion of fiber and glycemic control.

The patient's lines are in place, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP is being administered.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is to remain in the CCU for now.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury, and he is at risk for further brain damage.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has had episodes of ectopy and NSVT, and he is at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Shock liver or ischemic hepatitis: The patient's LFTs are trending down but still slightly elevated, and he is at risk for further liver damage.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is being ventilated, and he is at risk for respiratory failure.
5. Sepsis: The patient has a possible infection, and he is at risk for sepsis.
6. Bleeding: The patient has a possible coagulopathy, and he is at risk for bleeding.
7. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk for pulmonary embolism due to his immobility and the presence of a central venous catheter.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: No improvement in neuro status off sedation for 48
   hours. CT with signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or
   shift. Presence of muscle fasiculations and involuntary movements of
   unclear etiology, but possibly due to central neurological injuries.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   -Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - FU U/A
   - FU CXR
   - FU Sputum Cultures
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin/Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days;
   today is day [**1-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission, monitor for now.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg TID for now
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 75mg po/ng TID
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg po daily
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: No improvement in neuro status off sedation for 48
   hours. CT with signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or
   shift. Presence of muscle fasiculations and involuntary movements of
   unclear etiology, but possibly due to central neurological injuries.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   -Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - FU U/A
   - FU CXR
   - FU Sputum Cultures
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin/Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days;
   today is day [**1-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission, monitor for now.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg TID for now
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 75mg po/ng TID
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg po daily
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above

   Disposition: CCU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male who was intubated after a cardiac arrest. The patient has a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve. The cardiac arrest is still unclear, but possible etiologies include arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia, and stroke with atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Neurological status: The patient is unresponsive and has not improved off sedation for 48 hours. A CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. The patient has muscle fasciculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology.
* Cardiac status: The patient has a preserved EF, but has had episodes of ectopy and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, which have responded well to IV boluses of potassium. The patient is also taking metoprolol and ASA.
* Respiratory status: The patient is on a ventilator with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 40%. The patient's ABG shows a pH of 7.49, PCO2 of 31, and PO2 of 111.
* Hemodynamic status: The patient's blood pressure is 116/73 mmHg, heart rate is 95 bpm, and cardiac output is normal.
* Renal status: The patient's creatinine is 0.8 mg/dL, and the patient is receiving fluids and diuretics as needed.
* Hepatic status: The patient has shock liver or ischemic hepatitis, and the patient's LFTs are trending down.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Seizures: The patient's neurological status is concerning for seizures, and the patient is at risk for non-convulsive seizure activity.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has had episodes of ectopy and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and the patient is at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is on a ventilator, and the patient's respiratory status is concerning for respiratory failure.
* Sepsis: The patient has a fever, and the patient is at risk for sepsis.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's cardiac status and the use of anticoagulants.
* Renal failure: The patient's creatinine is elevated, and the patient is at risk for renal failure.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring the patient's neurological status and cardiac rhythm.
* Continuing to manage the patient's respiratory status with the ventilator.
* Repleting electrolytes as needed.
* Continuing the patient's medications, including metoprolol and ASA.
* Monitoring the patient's LFTs and renal function.
* Considering further cardiac testing, such as a cardiac MRI, to further evaluate the patient's cardiac status.
* Considering further neurological testing, such as an EEG, to further evaluate the patient's neurological status."

   Chief Complaint: Intubated s/p cardiac arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   - Neuro Recs: Though the etiology of patient's collapse and cardiac
   arrest remain unclear, primary arrythmia is of great concern. Given
   patient's history and presentation, his decreased mental status does
   not appear to be the primary event. His cardiac arrest and head trauma
   put him at significant risk for anoxic brain injury.
      - follow up CT head and neck to assess extent of trauma (rule out
   brain contusion    and delayed hemorrhage)
     - recommend continuous EEG monitoring to evaluate for nonconvulsive
   seizure   activity
      - minimize sedating medications for more accurate neurologic exams
   - EP Recs: If neuro status improves could consider EPS and then
   reconsider ICD . Continue to rate control, ASA.
   - ABG 10:30pm: (7.46/35/118 on AC Tv:500 RR: 16 PEEP: 5 Fi02: 40%). No
   vent changes made.
   - CT Head Final: Diffuse loss of [**Doctor Last Name 988**]-white differentiation with
   effacement of the sulci and ventricles. Given clinical history, this is
   likely to reflect edema secondary to anoxic brain injury. MRI is
   recommended for further characterization as clinically indicated.
   - CT Neck Final: 1. No evidence for fracture or acute malalignment
   involving the cervical spine. 2. Mild-to- moderate cervical spondylosis
   causing mild spinal canal stenosis.
   - Cxs: No growth to date, pending.
   - Increased ectopy last night with stimulation. Gave 40 KCL, rechecked
   lytes (K 4.0). Improved. Early morning again with increased ectopy.
   Gave another 40 KCL and increased Metroprolol to 75mg TID.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: No improvement in neuro status off sedation for 48
   hours. CT with signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or
   shift. Presence of muscle fasiculations and involuntary movements of
   unclear etiology, but possibly due to central neurological injuries.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   -Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - FU U/A
   - FU CXR
   - FU Sputum Cultures
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin/Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days;
   today is day [**1-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission, monitor for now.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg TID for now
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 75mg po/ng TID
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg po daily
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:  CCU Progress Note
   Chief Complaint: Intubated s/p cardiac arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   - Neuro Recs: Though the etiology of patient's collapse and cardiac
   arrest remain unclear, primary arrythmia is of great concern. Given
   patient's history and presentation, his decreased mental status does
   not appear to be the primary event. His cardiac arrest and head trauma
   put him at significant risk for anoxic brain injury.
      - follow up CT head and neck to assess extent of trauma (rule out
   brain contusion    and delayed hemorrhage)
     - recommend continuous EEG monitoring to evaluate for nonconvulsive
   seizure   activity
      - minimize sedating medications for more accurate neurologic exams
   - EP Recs: If neuro status improves could consider EPS and then
   reconsider ICD . Continue to rate control, ASA.
   - ABG 10:30pm: (7.46/35/118 on AC Tv:500 RR: 16 PEEP: 5 Fi02: 40%). No
   vent changes made.
   - CT Head Final: Diffuse loss of [**Doctor Last Name 988**]-white differentiation with
   effacement of the sulci and ventricles. Given clinical history, this is
   likely to reflect edema secondary to anoxic brain injury. MRI is
   recommended for further characterization as clinically indicated.
   - CT Neck Final: 1. No evidence for fracture or acute malalignment
   involving the cervical spine. 2. Mild-to- moderate cervical spondylosis
   causing mild spinal canal stenosis.
   - Cxs: No growth to date, pending.
   - Increased ectopy last night with stimulation. Gave 40 KCL, rechecked
   lytes (K 4.0). Improved. Early morning again with increased ectopy.
   Gave another 40 KCL and increased Metroprolol to 75mg TID.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve, who was admitted with possible seizure and cardiac arrest. He was intubated and transferred to the ICU for further workup. The patient's cardiac arrest was precipitated by wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM, and the etiology is still unclear. The patient has signs of anoxic brain injury on CT scan, and his neurological status has not improved despite being off sedation for 48 hours. He has muscle fasciculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology. The patient has also developed fever, which is likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis, and has been responding well to tylenol.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Anoxic brain injury: The patient's neurological status has not improved, and he is at risk of developing further brain injury or even death.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has had episodes of ectopy and NSVT, which have responded to IV boluses of K+. He is at risk of developing further cardiac arrhythmias, which could be life-threatening.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's fever is likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis, and he is at risk of developing pneumonia.
4. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukopenia suggest that he may be at risk of developing sepsis.
5. Liver damage: The patient has shock liver or ischemic hepatitis, and his LFTs are trending down. He is at risk of developing further liver damage.
6. Cervical spine injury: The patient's CT scan did not show evidence of fracture, but he is at risk of developing a ligamentous injury or other cervical spine injury.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on ventilator support, and he is at risk of developing further respiratory failure.
8. Cardiac failure: The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and he is at risk of developing cardiac failure.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust sedation and analgesia as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust medication as needed to prevent cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Continue to treat the patient's fever and monitor for signs of pneumonia.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function and adjust medication as needed to prevent further liver damage.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's cervical spine and adjust treatment as needed to prevent further injury.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilator support as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medication as needed to prevent cardiac failure."

   24 Hour Events:
   - ABG at 1400: 7.50/33/127/27/3 on CPAP 10/5, RT thought we should
   leave patient on CPAP at this time as neuro status is likely driving
   breathing and seems comfortable on CPAP; no indication for AC
   - Could not get MRI as patient has an implant in his ear and rads
   cannot characterize the model based on CT/plain films.  Radiology/neuro
   does not feel it's work risking his hearing to get MRI.  Repeat CT
   today which showed (per resident read): No hemorrhage or infarc,
   persistent diffuse loss of grey-white differentiation, soft tissue
   edema improved.  Overal impression: no interval change. (need to f/u
   final read)
   - Neuro still monitoring EEG, no evidence of seizures at this time.
   Feel that patient's condition stable at this time, difficult to judge
   improvement.
   - Urine benzos neg, TSH and B12 normal, ammonia pending
   - Patient's family would like meeting with neurology and CCU team.
   Wife will be here from 1pm until 8pm tomorrow.  Need to page neuro

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: No improvement in neuro status off sedation for 48
   hours. CT with signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or
   shift. Presence of muscle fasiculations and involuntary movements of
   unclear etiology, but possibly due to central neurological injuries.
   r/o other causes of encephalopathy
all tests negative. B12, TSH, NH3
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   -Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to stimuli
   -will plan for family meeting today with wife and [**Name2 (NI) 7435**] ([**Name (NI) 1795**] and
   Neuro attending)
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin/Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days;
   today is day [**2-10**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission, monitor for now.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg TID for now
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 75mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   #Access: Hold PICC for now as patient will be get lab draws q 3 days.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - ABG at 1400: 7.50/33/127/27/3 on CPAP 10/5, RT thought we should
   leave patient on CPAP at this time as neuro status is likely driving
   breathing and seems comfortable on CPAP; no indication for AC
   - Could not get MRI as patient has an implant in his ear and rads
   cannot characterize the model based on CT/plain films.  Radiology/neuro
   does not feel it's work risking his hearing to get MRI.  Repeat CT
   today which showed (per resident read): No hemorrhage or infarc,
   persistent diffuse loss of grey-white differentiation, soft tissue
   edema improved.  Overal impression: no interval change. (need to f/u
   final read)
   - Neuro still monitoring EEG, no evidence of seizures at this time.
   Feel that patient's condition stable at this time, difficult to judge
   improvement.
   - Urine benzos neg, TSH and B12 normal, ammonia pending
   - Patient's family would like meeting with neurology and CCU team.
   Wife will be here from 1pm until 8pm tomorrow.  Need to page neuro
   ([**Doctor First Name 7434**]) in the am and ask her to come to meeting with wife in
   afternoon.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery

   #Neuro status: No improvement in neuro status off sedation for 48
   hours. CT with signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve, who suffered a possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs. He was transferred to the ICU for further workup. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been off sedation for 48 hours. His neuro status remains unchanged, with no improvement in responsiveness, and a CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. The patient has muscle fasciculations and involuntary movements, possibly due to central neurological injuries.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Seizure activity: The patient's EEG is being monitored, and no evidence of seizures has been detected at this time. However, the patient's neuro status remains unchanged, and seizure activity is a possibility.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's fever and low-grade fevers may be indicative of aspiration pneumonia, which is a concern given his intubation status.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has had episodes of ectopy and NSVT, which have responded well to IV boluses of K+. Monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias is necessary, and EP recommendations have been made.
4. Left to right shunt: The patient's CT scan showed an aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of intracardiac shunting, which is likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return. An MRI is recommended to further characterize this finding.
5. Cervical spine injury: The patient's CT scan showed no evidence of fracture, but the collar cannot be removed without an MRI or patient verbalization of pain.
6. Shock liver or ischemic hepatitis: The patient's LFTs are trending down, but remain elevated. Monitoring for signs of liver dysfunction is necessary.
7. Cardiac failure: The patient's EF is preserved, but monitoring for signs of cardiac failure is necessary given his history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve.
8. Withdrawal syndrome: The patient's history of EtOH abuse makes withdrawal syndrome a possibility. CIWA has been recommended to monitor for withdrawal symptoms.
9. Infection: The patient's fever and low-grade fevers may be indicative of infection, which is a concern given his intubation status and history of EtOH abuse. Blood cultures have been ordered, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP is being continued."

   24 Hour Events:
   - ABG at 1400: 7.50/33/127/27/3 on CPAP 10/5, RT thought we should
   leave patient on CPAP at this time as neuro status is likely driving
   breathing and seems comfortable on CPAP; no indication for AC
   - Could not get MRI as patient has an implant in his ear and rads
   cannot characterize the model based on CT/plain films.  Radiology/neuro
   does not feel it's work risking his hearing to get MRI.  Repeat CT
   today which showed (per resident read): No hemorrhage or infarc,
   persistent diffuse loss of grey-white differentiation, soft tissue
   edema improved.  Overal impression: no interval change. (need to f/u
   final read)
   - Neuro still monitoring EEG, no evidence of seizures at this time.
   Feel that patient's condition stable at this time, difficult to judge
   improvement.
   - Urine benzos neg, TSH and B12 normal, ammonia pending
   - Patient's family would like meeting with neurology and CCU team.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: No improvement in neuro status off sedation for 48
   hours. CT with signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or
   shift. Presence of muscle fasiculations and involuntary movements of
   unclear etiology, but possibly due to central neurological injuries.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   -Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to stimuli
   -will plan for family meeting today with wife and [**Name2 (NI) 7435**] ([**Name (NI) 1795**] and
   Neuro attending)
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - FU U/A
   - FU CXR
   - FU Sputum Cultures
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Vancomycin/Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days;
   today is day [**2-10**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission, monitor for now.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 75 mg TID for now
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 75mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   #Access: Hold PICC for now as patient will be get lab draws q 3 days.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve, who was admitted to the ICU after a possible seizure and cardiac arrest. He has been on mechanical ventilation for 24 hours and is currently on CPAP 10/5 with a SpO2 of 93%. His neuro status is unchanged, with no improvement in responsiveness or response to stimuli. His CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. He has been off sedation for 48 hours and is still unresponsive.

The patient's cardiac enzymes and LFTs are elevated, and he has a dilated heart with preserved EF on echocardiogram. He has had episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to IV boluses of K+. He is also experiencing left-to-right shunt, likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return, and has minimal CAD.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, blood pressure of 136/78 mmHg, and heart rate of 85 bpm. His respiratory rate is 21 inspirations per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 93%. He has a slight skin breakdown behind his neck and burn marks from defibrillator pads.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he is still on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of respiratory failure if his condition deteriorates.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's neuro status is unchanged, and there is a risk of further neurological deterioration or even death if he does not improve.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes and LFTs are elevated, and he has a dilated heart with preserved EF. There is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias or even cardiac arrest if his condition deteriorates.
4. Infection: The patient has a fever, and there is a risk of infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient has a slight skin breakdown behind his neck, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient is receiving nutrition through a PICC line, but there is a risk of nutritional deficiencies if his condition deteriorates.
7. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolytes are being monitored, but there is a risk of electrolyte imbalance if his condition deteriorates.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilation settings as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's neuro status and adjust his sedation and pain management as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust his medications as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's temperature and adjust his antibiotics as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's skin breakdown and adjust his wound care as needed.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's nutritional status and adjust his nutrition as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte status and adjust his electrolyte management as needed."

   24 Hour Events:
   - Family Meeting: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1795**] and Neuro hopeful. Will monitor over weekend
   and re-assess function beginning of week.
   - Simvastatin DC'd and Vancomycin DC'd
   - CT Head final: Prelim without significant change from previous.
   Neuro: EEG suggests a moderate to severe encephalopathy involving
   cortical and subcortical structures. Additionally, posterior
   parasagittal suppression suggests a posterior circulation distribution
   abnormalitiy and may warrant further investigation. Overall, this
   record is slightly improved from the previous 24 hours due to the
   increase in frequency of the background rhythm. NO electrographic
   seizures were noted
   - Spoke with ENT physician in RI ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7448**]) patient had
   Right Stapedectomy with a prosthetic stapes implant about 10 years ago
   (NO COCHLEAR IMPLANT! RADIOLOGY REPORT WAS INCORRECT!); He had a McGee
   Piston prosthetic that is likely MRI compatible.
   There is one brand made in [**2136**] that is not compatible, and not sure
   which brand patient has. So...radiology is willing to do an MRI on
   patient with proper consent if an MRI is needed. There are 2
   complications that the family must know. If patient has the one brand
   that is incompatible: 1. Deafness (wife says patient is already deaf in
   that ear...) 2. Disruption of oval window that can cause a fluid leak,
   and surgery will need to fix this. If family is willing to agree to
   these potential complications, than radiology will perform the MRI.
   - Will contact Neuro and let them know.
   - Increased metoprolol to 100 TID b/c of increased ectopy

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   Unresponsive
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. 3L positive length of stay.
   - Lasix 20mg IV today, -500 cc today
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  r/o other causes of
   encephalopathy
all tests negative. B12, TSH, NH3
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   -Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to stimuli
   -Will d/w neuro and family possibility of MRI/MRA as patient may be a
   candidate now.
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**3-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission; Increased ectopy (NSVT)
   overnight.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Increased metoprolol from 75 mg TID to 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   #Access: Hold PICC for now as patient will be get lab draws q 3 days

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Family Meeting: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1795**] and Neuro hopeful. Will monitor over weekend
   and re-assess function beginning of week.
   - Simvastatin DC'd and Vancomycin DC'd
   - CT Head final: Prelim without significant change from previous.
   Neuro: EEG suggests a moderate to severe encephalopathy involving
   cortical and subcortical structures. Additionally, posterior
   parasagittal suppression suggests a posterior circulation distribution
   abnormalitiy and may warrant further investigation. Overall, this
   record is slightly improved from the previous 24 hours due to the
   increase in frequency of the background rhythm. NO electrographic
   seizures were noted
   - Spoke with ENT physician in RI ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7448**]) patient had
   Right Stapedectomy with a prosthetic stapes implant about 10 years ago
   (NO COCHLEAR IMPLANT! RADIOLOGY REPORT WAS INCORRECT!); He had a McGee
   Piston prosthetic that is likely MRI compatible.
   There is one brand made in [**2136**] that is not compatible, and not sure
   which brand patient has. So...radiology is willing to do an MRI on
   patient with proper consent if an MRI is needed. There are 2
   complications that the family must know. If patient has the one brand
   that is incompatible: 1. Deafness (wife says patient is already deaf in
   that ear...) 2. Disruption of oval window that can cause a fluid leak,
   and surgery will need to fix this. If family is willing to agree to
   these potential complications, than radiology will perform the MRI.
   - Will contact Neuro and let them know.
   - Increased metoprolol to 100 TID b/c of increased ectopy

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a possible seizure and cardiac arrest. He has a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve. He is currently intubated and on a ventilator, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 5. He has a moderate to severe encephalopathy with cortical and subcortical structures affected, as evidenced by his EEG and CT scan. He has a posterior circulation distribution abnormality, which may warrant further investigation.

The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, with a preserved ejection fraction (EF) and no signs of heart failure. He has a dilated heart on echocardiogram, which is likely secondary to his bicuspid aortic valve and mitral valve prolapse. He has had episodes of ectopy and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) in the past, which have responded to IV boluses of potassium.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 97%. He has a tracheostomy tube in place and is on a ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated cardiac enzymes and liver function tests (LFTs), consistent with cardiac and liver injury. His white blood cell count is 11.3, and his platelet count is 73.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs suggest a high risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and cardiac death.
2. Neurological complications: The patient's moderate to severe encephalopathy and posterior circulation distribution abnormality suggest a high risk of neurological complications, including seizures, stroke, and brain death.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he is at risk for respiratory complications, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and respiratory failure.
4. Liver complications: The patient's elevated LFTs suggest a high risk of liver complications, including liver failure, jaundice, and bleeding.
5. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests a high risk of renal complications, including acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease.
6. Infection: The patient's febrile response and elevated white blood cell count suggest a high risk of infection, including pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, with serial ECGs and telemetry.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status closely, with serial neurological exams and imaging studies as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, with serial arterial blood gas (ABG) analyses and oxygen saturation measurements.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's liver function closely, with serial LFTs and bilirubin levels.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function closely, with serial creatinine levels and urine output measurements.
6. Consider ordering additional imaging studies, such as a head CT or MRI, to further evaluate the patient's posterior circulation distribution abnormality.
7. Consider ordering additional laboratory tests, such as a troponin level or a D-dimer level, to further evaluate the patient's cardiac and pulmonary status.
8. Consider ordering additional medications, such as anticoagulation therapy or antibiotics, to prevent or treat potential complications.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent or treat these complications and improve his outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   Unresponsive
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. 3L positive length of stay.
   - Lasix 20mg IV today, -500 cc today
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  r/o other causes of
   encephalopathy
all tests negative. B12, TSH, NH3
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   -Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to stimuli
   -Will d/w neuro and family possibility of MRI/MRA as patient may be a
   candidate now.
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**3-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission; Increased ectopy (NSVT)
   overnight.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Increased metoprolol from 75 mg TID to 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   #Access: Hold PICC for now as patient will be get lab draws q 3 days

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   Unresponsive
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. 3L positive length of stay.
   - Lasix 20mg IV today, -500 cc today
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  r/o other causes of
   encephalopathy
all tests negative. B12, TSH, NH3
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   -Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to stimuli
   -Will d/w neuro and family possibility of MRI/MRA as patient may be a
   candidate now.
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**3-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission; Increased ectopy (NSVT)
   overnight.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Increased metoprolol from 75 mg TID to 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   #Access: Hold PICC for now as patient will be get lab draws q 3 days

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve, who was transferred to the ICU after a possible seizure and cardiac arrest. He is currently unresponsive, on a ventilator, and has a moderate to severe encephalopathy involving cortical and subcortical structures. The EEG suggests a posterior circulation distribution abnormality, which may warrant further investigation.

The patient's cardiac enzymes and LFTs are elevated, and he has a dilated heart with preserved EF on echocardiogram. He has had episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to IV boluses of K+. The patient is also at risk for a left-to-right shunt due to anomalous pulmonary venous return.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 11.3
* Hct: 37.1
* Plt: 73
* Cr: 0.8
* TropT: 0.04
* TCO2: 24
* Glucose: 124
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.4/24.4/1.0, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T: 495/3/0.02, ALT/AST: 91/91, Alk Phos/T Bili: 68/0.9, Amylase/Lipase: 19, Differential-Neuts: 90.2%, Lymph: 6.0%, Mono: 3.1%, Eos: 0.6%, Albumin: 3.3 g/dL, LDH: 506 IU/L, Ca++: 8.9 mg/dL, Mg++: 2.2 mg/dL, PO4: 3.8 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Neurological: The patient's encephalopathy may worsen, leading to further neurological deficits or even brain death.
2. Cardiac: The patient's cardiac enzymes and LFTs are elevated, and he has a dilated heart with preserved EF. He may be at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory: The patient is on a ventilator, and his respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure.
4. Infection: The patient has a fever, and there is a concern for aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis.
5. Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and may be at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or malnutrition.
6. Hematological: The patient's platelet count is low, and he may be at risk for bleeding complications.
7. Endocrine: The patient's glucose levels are slightly elevated, and he may be at risk for hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
8. Renal: The patient's creatinine levels are slightly elevated, and he may be at risk for acute kidney injury.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his sedation and analgesia accordingly.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and LFTs, and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his ventilator settings accordingly.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and adjust his antibiotic therapy accordingly.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust his nutrition plan accordingly.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's hematological status and adjust his platelet transfusion plan accordingly.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's endocrine status and adjust his glucose control plan accordingly.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's renal status and adjust his fluid management plan accordingly.

Potential next steps:

1. Consider performing an MRI or MRA to further investigate the patient's posterior circulation distribution abnormality.
2. Consider performing a cardiac catheterization to further investigate the patient's cardiac status.
3. Consider performing a gastrointestinal workup to further investigate the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms.
4. Consider performing a hematological workup to further investigate the patient's hematological status.
5. Consider performing an endocrine workup to further investigate the patient's endocrine status.
6. Consider performing a renal workup to further investigate the patient's renal status."

   24 Hour Events:
   - Family Meeting: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1795**] and Neuro hopeful. Will monitor over weekend
   and re-assess function beginning of week.
   - Simvastatin DC'd and Vancomycin DC'd
   - CT Head final: Prelim without significant change from previous.
   Neuro: EEG suggests a moderate to severe encephalopathy involving
   cortical and subcortical structures. Additionally, posterior
   parasagittal suppression suggests a posterior circulation distribution
   abnormalitiy and may warrant further investigation. Overall, this
   record is slightly improved from the previous 24 hours due to the
   increase in frequency of the background rhythm. NO electrographic
   seizures were noted
   - Spoke with ENT physician in RI ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7448**]) patient had
   Right Stapedectomy with a prosthetic stapes implant about 10 years ago
   (NO COCHLEAR IMPLANT! RADIOLOGY REPORT WAS INCORRECT!); He had a McGee
   Piston prosthetic that is likely MRI compatible.
   There is one brand made in [**2136**] that is not compatible, and not sure
   which brand patient has. So...radiology is willing to do an MRI on
   patient with proper consent if an MRI is needed. There are 2
   complications that the family must know. If patient has the one brand
   that is incompatible: 1. Deafness (wife says patient is already deaf in
   that ear...) 2. Disruption of oval window that can cause a fluid leak,
   and surgery will need to fix this. If family is willing to agree to
   these potential complications, than radiology will perform the MRI.
   - Will contact Neuro and let them know.
   - Increased metoprolol to 100 TID b/c of increased ectopy

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 YO M wtih history of MVP and bicuspid aortic
   valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation
   in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   Unresponsive
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   - Appreciate further Neuro recommendations now that off sedation for 48
   hrs.
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  r/o other causes of
   encephalopathy
all tests negative. B12, TSH, NH3
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   -CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens
   -Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to stimuli
   -Will d/w neuro and family possibility of MRI/MRA as patient may be a
   candidate now.
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. No
   leukocytosis.  Febrile to 101initially, continues with low-grade
   fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent withdrawal in
   pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or tachycardic.
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**3-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission; Increased ectopy (NSVT)
   overnight.
   - Repelte electrolytes PRN
   - Increased metoprolol from 75 mg TID to 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   -If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metorpolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unablel to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Family Meeting: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1795**] and Neuro hopeful. Will monitor over weekend
   and re-assess function beginning of week.
   - Simvastatin DC'd and Vancomycin DC'd
   - CT Head final: Prelim without significant change from previous.
   Neuro: EEG suggests a moderate to severe encephalopathy involving
   cortical and subcortical structures. Additionally, posterior
   parasagittal suppression suggests a posterior circulation distribution
   abnormalitiy and may warrant further investigation. Overall, this
   record is slightly improved from the previous 24 hours due to the
   increase in frequency of the background rhythm. NO electrographic
   seizures were noted
   - Spoke with ENT physician in RI ([**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 7448**]) patient had
   Right Stapedectomy with a prosthetic stapes implant about 10 years ago
   (NO COCHLEAR IMPLANT! RADIOLOGY REPORT WAS INCORRECT!); He had a McGee
   Piston prosthetic that is likely MRI compatible.
   There is one brand made in [**2136**] that is not compatible, and not sure
   which brand patient has. So...radiology is willing to do an MRI on
   patient with proper consent if an MRI is needed. There are 2
   complications that the family must know. If patient has the one brand
   that is incompatible: 1. Deafness (wife says patient is already deaf in
   that ear...) 2. Disruption of oval window that can cause a fluid leak,
   and surgery will need to fix this. If family is willing to agree to
   these potential complications, than radiology will perform the MRI.
   - Will contact Neuro and let them know.
   - Increased metoprolol to 100 TID b/c of increased ectopy

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve who was admitted to the ICU after a possible seizure and cardiac arrest. He has been intubated and is currently on a ventilator. His neurological status is unchanged, with moderate to severe encephalopathy and posterior circulation distribution abnormality on EEG. He has been off sedation for 72 hours and is showing minor withdrawal to pain and more EEG activity.

The patient has had several complications, including a left-to-right shunt, possible Afib, and an abnormal MRI. He has also had episodes of ectopy and NSVT, which have responded well to IV boluses of K+. His cardiac enzymes and LFTs are elevated, and he has been diagnosed with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis.

The patient's medical team is concerned about several potential complications, including:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is still unclear, and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM, or stroke with Afib.
2. Neurological recovery: The patient's neurological status is still uncertain, and his EEG shows signs of anoxic brain injury.
3. Fever: The patient has had low-grade fevers, which may be due to aspiration PNA or pneumonitis.
4. Rhythm: The patient's heart rhythm is abnormal, with dilated heart and preserved EF, and he has had episodes of ectopy and NSVT.
5. Left-to-right shunt: The patient has a left-to-right shunt, which may be secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return.

Potential medical complications:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is still unclear, and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM, or stroke with Afib.
2. Neurological recovery: The patient's neurological status is still uncertain, and his EEG shows signs of anoxic brain injury.
3. Fever: The patient has had low-grade fevers, which may be due to aspiration PNA or pneumonitis.
4. Rhythm: The patient's heart rhythm is abnormal, with dilated heart and preserved EF, and he has had episodes of ectopy and NSVT.
5. Left-to-right shunt: The patient has a left-to-right shunt, which may be secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust medication as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust sedation as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's fever and adjust antibiotics as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's left-to-right shunt and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Consider performing a cardiac MRI to further characterize the patient's cardiac anatomy and function.

Note: The patient's family should be informed of the potential complications and recommendations, and a family meeting should be scheduled to discuss the patient's condition and prognosis."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3L positive length of stay.   Ge started Lasix 20mg IV x 2
   yesterday but did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   - Standing Lasix 40mg po BID to diurese, as receiving tube feeds and
   not self-diuresing
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - Family consented for MRI/MRA; will do this tomorrow to assess neuro
   status
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. WBC
   increased to 11.3 today.  Febrile to 100.2 in last 24 hours and with
   low-grade fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent
   withdrawal in pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or
   tachycardic.
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora, last chest xray [**6-27**]
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**4-12**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission; Increased ectopy (NSVT)
   overnight.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Increased metoprolol from 75 mg TID to 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.  Will get MRI tomorrow.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #.[**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   #Access: Hold PICC for now as patient will be get lab draws q 3 days

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Disposition: CCU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve who suffered a cardiac arrest and is currently intubated and minimally responsive. The patient has been in the ICU for 3 days and has undergone various tests and treatments.

The patient's neurological status has shown some improvement, with minor withdrawal to pain and more EEG activity. However, the patient remains unresponsive and has a CT scan showing signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.

The patient has a fever, which is being treated with Tylenol, and has increased white blood cell count. The patient's rhythm is abnormal, with episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to IV boluses of K+. The patient has also been experiencing left-to-right shunt, which is likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return.

The patient's cardiac enzymes and LFTs are trending down, and the patient is receiving tube feeds. The patient's electrolytes are being monitored and repleted as needed.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on a ventilator, which increases the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Neurological damage: The patient's anoxic brain injury may lead to long-term neurological damage or even death.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and increased white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infection, which can be life-threatening.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's abnormal rhythm may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening.
5. Left-to-right shunt: The patient's left-to-right shunt may lead to heart failure or other cardiovascular complications.
6. Ischemic hepatitis: The patient's LFTs are trending down, which may indicate ischemic hepatitis, a potentially life-threatening condition.
7. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds, which may not be sufficient to meet their nutritional needs, leading to malnutrition.
8. Wound complications: The patient has a slight skin breakdown behind the neck and burn marks from the defibrillator pads, which may lead to wound complications.

To mitigate these risks, the patient's care team should continue to monitor his vital signs, neurological status, and cardiac function, and provide supportive care to manage his symptoms and prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3L positive length of stay.   Ge started Lasix 20mg IV x 2
   yesterday but did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   - Standing Lasix 40mg po BID to diurese, as receiving tube feeds and
   not self-diuresing
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - Family consented for MRI/MRA; will do this tomorrow to assess neuro
   status
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. WBC
   increased to 11.3 today.  Febrile to 100.2 in last 24 hours and with
   low-grade fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent
   withdrawal in pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or
   tachycardic.
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora, last chest xray [**6-27**]
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**4-12**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission; Increased ectopy (NSVT)
   overnight.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Increased metoprolol from 75 mg TID to 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.  Will get MRI tomorrow.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #.[**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   #Access: Hold PICC for now as patient will be get lab draws q 3 days

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks: neuron status unchanged.  For mri
   tomorrow
   Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 1795**] to resume coverage tomorrow
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) **]  on:[**2159-7-1**]

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who suffered cardiac arrest and was intubated. He remains minimally responsive and has been on mechanical ventilation. His neurological status has shown some improvement over the past week, with minor withdrawal to pain and more EEG activity. However, he still has anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift, and his muscle fasciculations and involuntary movements are unclear in etiology.

The patient's cardiac enzymes and LFTs are elevated, suggesting possible cardiac injury. He has a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve, and his echocardiogram shows a dilated heart with preserved EF.

The patient's respiratory support is ongoing, with a Vt set at 500 mL and a PS of 10 cmH2O. His SpO2 is 96%, and his ABG shows a pH of 7.51, PaO2 of 298, and PaCO2 of 25.

The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he is receiving antibiotics for possible pneumonia. His WBC count is 11.3, and his temperature is 100.2°F.

The patient's cardiac rhythm is stable, with no episodes of Afib since admission. His electrolytes are being monitored and repleted as needed.

The patient's cervical spine is stable, with a CT scan showing no fracture. However, he is still wearing a collar until his neck is cleared by MRI.

The patient's alcohol abuse history is being monitored, and he is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and WBC count suggest the possibility of pneumonia.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes and LFTs are elevated, and he has a history of cardiac injury.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's anoxic brain injury and muscle fasciculations and involuntary movements suggest the possibility of further neurological decline.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory support is ongoing, and he may be at risk for further respiratory decline.
5. Infection: The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he is at risk for further infection.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac rhythm is stable, but he may be at risk for further arrhythmias.
7. Cervical spine instability: The patient's cervical spine is stable, but he may be at risk for further instability if his neck is not cleared by MRI.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3L positive length of stay.   Ge started Lasix 20mg IV x 2
   yesterday but did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   - Standing Lasix 40mg po BID to diurese, as receiving tube feeds and
   not self-diuresing
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - Family consented for MRI/MRA; will do this tomorrow to assess neuro
   status
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. WBC
   increased to 11.3 today.  Febrile to 100.2 in last 24 hours and with
   low-grade fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent
   withdrawal in pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or
   tachycardic.
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**4-12**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission; Increased ectopy (NSVT)
   overnight.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Increased metoprolol from 75 mg TID to 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #. CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #. Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.  Will get MRI tomorrow.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #. [**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3L positive length of stay.   Ge started Lasix 20mg IV x 2
   yesterday but did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   - Standing Lasix 40mg po BID to diurese, as receiving tube feeds and
   not self-diuresing
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - Family consented for MRI/MRA; will do this tomorrow to assess neuro
   status
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis. WBC
   increased to 11.3 today.  Febrile to 100.2 in last 24 hours and with
   low-grade fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent
   withdrawal in pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or
   tachycardic.
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora, last chest xray [**6-27**]
   - FU Blood cultures
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**4-12**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission; Increased ectopy (NSVT)
   overnight.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Increased metoprolol from 75 mg TID to 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.  Will get MRI tomorrow.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #.[**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above
   #Access: Hold PICC for now as patient will be get lab draws q 3 days

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   increased to 11.3 today.  Febrile to 100.2 in last 24 hours and with
   low-grade fevers. Responds well to tylenol. Unlikely to represent
   withdrawal in pt with hx of EtOH abuse b/c not hypertensive or
   tachycardic.
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora, last chest xray [**6-27**]

   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission; Increased ectopy (NSVT)
   overnight.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Increased metoprolol from 75 mg TID to 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI

   Disposition: CCU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest. He remains intubated and minimally responsive with slight improvement in his neurological status over the past week.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is still unclear, and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia, or stroke with AFib. Further investigation and treatment are needed to determine the cause and prevent future episodes.
2. Neurological status: The patient's neurological status is still uncertain, and further imaging studies such as MRI/MRA are needed to assess the extent of anoxic brain injury. The presence of muscle fasciculations and involuntary movements may indicate central neurological injuries.
3. Fever: The patient's fever is likely due to aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis, and further investigation with sputum cultures and blood cultures is needed to determine the cause. The patient's WBC count has increased, and he is at risk of developing sepsis.
4. Rhythm: The patient's rhythm is unstable, with episodes of ectopy and NSVT. Further management with IV boluses of K+ and increased metoprolol may be necessary to control his rhythm.
5. Left to Right Shunt: The patient's shunt is likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return, and further characterization with MRI is needed. If the patient awakens, a cardiac MRI may be necessary to further assess his cardiac function.
6. CAD: The patient's CAD is minimal, but further management with metoprolol and ASA may be necessary to prevent further complications.
7. Pump failure: The patient's pump function is preserved, but further monitoring is necessary to detect any signs of heart failure.
8. Cervical spine: The patient's cervical spine is unstable, and further imaging studies such as MRI are needed to assess the extent of any damage. If the patient awakens, the collar may need to be removed, and further management with physical therapy may be necessary.
9. Alcohol abuse: The patient's history of alcohol abuse may indicate a risk of withdrawal, and further management with CIWA may be necessary.
10. LFTs: The patient's LFTs are trending down, but further monitoring is necessary to detect any signs of liver damage.

In summary, the patient's condition is complex and requires further investigation and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3.5L positive length of stay.  Did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc, but input is much greater
   than output, given continuous tube feeds.
    -Will give 20 mg IV Lasix x 1 and monitor- will give more as needed,
   with goal of
 500 cc- 1 Liter today.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3. Now with left upper
   extremity tremors of unsure etiology at this time.
   - F/U EEG results
   - Family consented for MRI/MRA; will do this today to assess neuro
   status
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis;
   unable to isolate an organism at this point. WBC decreased to 9.6
   today.  Afebrile in last 24 hours. Responds well to tylenol. Patient
   appears to be improving on current Antibiotic regimen
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora,
   - F/U CXR this AM
   - FU Blood cultures; [**6-25**] shows no growth, [**6-27**] set pending
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**5-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to increased metoprolol PVC
s and NSVT overnight; but
   maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent ectopy or stops
   responding to K boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Skin Breakdown: Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around edge of
   cervical collar and unable to remove until negative MRI; Unable to
   assess sacrum as patient unable to move with cervical collar in place.
   - MRI today; if negative, will remove cervical collar and turn patient.
   - Frequent turning after MRI to assess dorsum
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #Respitory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.  RSBI this
   AM 87
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but given his
   depressed mental status will hold for now.
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated for 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.  Will get MRI today.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #.[**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3.5L positive length of stay.  Did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc, but input is much greater
   than output, given continuous tube feeds.
    -Will give 20 mg IV Lasix x 1 and monitor- will give more as needed,
   with goal of
 500 cc- 1 Liter today.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3. Now with left upper
   extremity tremors of unsure etiology at this time.
   - F/U EEG results
   - Family consented for MRI/MRA; will do this today to assess neuro
   status
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis;
   unable to isolate an organism at this point. WBC decreased to 9.6
   today.  Afebrile in last 24 hours. Responds well to tylenol. Patient
   appears to be improving on current Antibiotic regimen
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora,
   - F/U CXR this AM
   - FU Blood cultures; [**6-25**] shows no growth, [**6-27**] set pending
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**5-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to increased metoprolol PVC
s and NSVT overnight; but
   maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent ectopy or stops
   responding to K boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Skin Breakdown: Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around edge of
   cervical collar and unable to remove until negative MRI; Unable to
   assess sacrum as patient unable to move with cervical collar in place.
   - MRI today; if negative, will remove cervical collar and turn patient.
   - Frequent turning after MRI to assess dorsum
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #Respitory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.  RSBI this
   AM 87
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but given his
   depressed mental status will hold for now.
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated for 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.  Will get MRI today.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #.[**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve who was admitted after a possible seizure and cardiac arrest. He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement in his neurological status over the past week. The patient has a cardiac arrest with unclear etiology, and possible stroke with AFib is another possibility. He has left upper extremity tremors of unknown etiology, and an EEG is pending. The patient has a fever, and the etiology is unclear, with oral flora on sputum culture. He has dilated heart in echocardiogram with preserved EF, and has had episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased metoprolol. The patient has a stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar and unable to remove until negative MRI. He is intubated on moderate settings, and RSBI is 87. The patient has a left to right shunt, most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return, and a cardiac MRI is recommended. He has minimal CAD, and CE's are down. The patient's LFTs are trending down, and he has shock liver or ischemic hepatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is still unclear, and possible etiologies include arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia, and stroke with AFib. Further investigation and treatment are needed to determine the cause and prevent future episodes.
2. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is still improving, but he remains minimally responsive and intubated. Further evaluation with EEG and MRI is needed to determine the cause of his neurological deterioration and to monitor for any further changes.
3. Fever: The patient's fever is unclear, and further investigation is needed to determine the etiology and to prevent further complications.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient has a stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar, and further evaluation with MRI is needed to determine the extent of the damage and to plan for further treatment.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated on moderate settings, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of his respiratory failure and to plan for weaning from the ventilator.
6. Left to right shunt: The patient has a left to right shunt, most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return, and further evaluation with cardiac MRI is needed to determine the extent of the shunt and to plan for further treatment.
7. Shock liver or ischemic hepatitis: The patient's LFTs are trending down, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of his shock liver or ischemic hepatitis and to plan for further treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and to treat any arrhythmias that occur.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and to treat any further changes or deterioration.
3. Continue to investigate the etiology of the patient's fever and to treat any further complications.
4. Continue to evaluate and treat the patient's skin breakdown and pressure ulcer.
5. Continue to evaluate and treat the patient's respiratory failure and to plan for weaning from the ventilator.
6. Continue to evaluate and treat the patient's left to right shunt and to plan for further treatment.
7. Continue to evaluate and treat the patient's shock liver or ischemic hepatitis and to plan for further treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3.5L positive length of stay.  Did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc, but input is much greater
   than output, given continuous tube feeds.
    -Will give 20 mg IV Lasix x 1 and monitor- will give more as needed,
   with goal of
 500 cc- 1 Liter today.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3. Now with left upper
   extremity tremors of unsure etiology at this time.
   - F/U EEG results
   - Family consented for MRI/MRA; will do this today to assess neuro
   status
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis;
   unable to isolate an organism at this point. WBC decreased to 9.6
   today.  Afebrile in last 24 hours. Responds well to tylenol. Patient
   appears to be improving on current Antibiotic regimen
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora,
   - F/U CXR this AM
   - FU Blood cultures; [**6-25**] shows no growth, [**6-27**] set pending
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**5-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to increased metoprolol PVC
s and NSVT overnight; but
   maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent ectopy or stops
   responding to K boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Skin Breakdown: Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around edge of
   cervical collar and unable to remove until negative MRI; Unable to
   assess sacrum as patient unable to move with cervical collar in place.
   - MRI today; if negative, will remove cervical collar and turn patient.
   - Frequent turning after MRI to assess dorsum
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #Respitory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.  RSBI this
   AM 87
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but given his
   depressed mental status will hold for now.
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated for 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve, who was admitted with a possible seizure and cardiac arrest. He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with a slight improvement in his neurological status over the past week. The patient has been experiencing various medical complications, including left upper extremity tremors, fever, cardiac rhythm disturbances, and skin breakdown.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 105/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and heart medications. He is also receiving tube feeds and has a central line and arterial line in place.

Potential medical complications:

1. Seizure disorder: The patient's history of possible seizure and cardiac arrest, as well as his current left upper extremity tremors, suggest that he may be at risk for seizure activity.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and abnormal laboratory results, such as elevated white blood cell count and abnormal liver function tests, suggest that he may have an underlying infection.
3. Cardiac rhythm disturbances: The patient's cardiac rhythm disturbances, including wide-complex tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, may indicate a high risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown and pressure ulcer around the edge of his cervical collar may require further evaluation and management.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure, as indicated by his RSBI of 87, may require further evaluation and management, including possible tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation.
6. Left-to-right shunt: The patient's left-to-right shunt, as suggested by his echocardiogram, may require further evaluation and management, including possible cardiac MRI.
7. Cervical spine injury: The patient's cervical spine injury, as suggested by his CT scan, may require further evaluation and management, including possible MRI and removal of his cervical collar.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his sedation and analgesia as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust his medications as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's skin breakdown and pressure ulcer, and consider further evaluation and management.
4. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's respiratory failure, including possible tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation.
5. Consider further evaluation and management of the patient's left-to-right shunt, including possible cardiac MRI.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3.5L positive length of stay.  Did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc, but input is much greater
   than output, given continuous tube feeds.
    -Will give 20 mg IV Lasix x 1 and monitor- will give more as needed,
   with goal of
 500 cc- 1 Liter today.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3. Now with left upper
   extremity tremors of unsure etiology at this time.
   - F/U EEG results
   - Family consented for MRI/MRA; will do this today to assess neuro
   status
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis;
   unable to isolate an organism at this point. WBC decreased to 9.6
   today.  Afebrile in last 24 hours. Responds well to tylenol. Patient
   appears to be improving on current Antibiotic regimen
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora,
   - F/U CXR this AM
   - FU Blood cultures; [**6-25**] shows no growth, [**6-27**] set pending
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**5-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission; Increased ectopy (NSVT)
   overnight.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Skin Breakdown: Patient with breakdown around collar and unable to
   remove until negative MRI
   - MRI today
   - Frequent turning after MRI to assess dorsum
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #Respitory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.  RSBI this
   AM 87
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but given his
   depressed mental status will hold for now.
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated for 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.  Will get MRI today.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #.[**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3.5L positive length of stay.  Did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc, but input is much greater
   than output, given continuous tube feeds.
    -Will give 20 mg IV Lasix x 1 and monitor- will give more as needed,
   with goal of
 500 cc- 1 Liter today.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3. Now with left upper
   extremity tremors of unsure etiology at this time.
   - F/U EEG results
   - Family consented for MRI/MRA; will do this today to assess neuro
   status
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis;
   unable to isolate an organism at this point. WBC decreased to 9.6
   today.  Afebrile in last 24 hours. Responds well to tylenol. Patient
   appears to be improving on current Antibiotic regimen
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora,
   - F/U CXR this AM
   - FU Blood cultures; [**6-25**] shows no growth, [**6-27**] set pending
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**5-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to IV boluses of K+. Initial discussion of possible
   Afib; has had no episodes since admission; Increased ectopy (NSVT)
   overnight.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent or stops responding to K
   boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Skin Breakdown: Patient with breakdown around collar and unable to
   remove until negative MRI
   - MRI today
   - Frequent turning after MRI to assess dorsum
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed

   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.

   Disposition: CCU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition is as follows:

**Cardiovascular:**

* The patient has a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs.
* The cardiac arrest was likely caused by arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at 220 BPM (VFib specifically), or stroke with AFib.
* The patient has a dilated heart in echocardiogram with preserved EF, bicuspid AS, and mitral valve mixomatous degeneration.
* The patient has had episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which responded well to IV boluses of K+.
* The patient is on metoprolol 100mg TID and ASA 325 mg daily.

**Neurological:**

* The patient is minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement in his neurological status over the past week.
* The patient has an anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift, as seen on CT scan.
* The patient has muscle fasciculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, possibly due to central neurological injuries.
* The patient has left upper extremity tremors of unsure etiology.
* The patient's EEG is pending, and an MRI/MRA is planned today to assess neuro status.

**Respiratory:**

* The patient is intubated on moderate settings, with a RSBI of 87.
* The patient's lung status is appropriate for weaning, but given his depressed mental status, intubation will be held for now.
* Consideration is being given to tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to prolonged intubation.

**Infectious:**

* The patient has a fever, which is concerning for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis.
* The patient's WBC has decreased to 9.6, and they are afebrile in the last 24 hours.
* The patient's sputum cultures are pending, and blood cultures are pending.

**Other:**

* The patient has skin breakdown around the collar and is unable to remove it until a negative MRI is obtained.
* The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with intubation and mechanical ventilation.
* The patient has a left-to-right shunt, which is likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return.
* The patient's CAD is minimal, and they have been catheterized with clean coronaries.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Further cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest
* Increased risk of respiratory failure or pneumonia
* Development of skin breakdown or pressure ulcers
* Increased risk of infection, particularly respiratory or bloodstream infections
* Further neurological decline or seizures
* Development of cardiac failure or heart failure
* Need for further surgical intervention, such as tracheostomy or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3.5L positive length of stay.  Did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc, but input is much greater
   than output, given continuous tube feeds.
    -Will give 20 mg IV Lasix x 1 and monitor- will give more as needed,
   with goal of even to +300 cc today.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3. Now with left upper
   extremity tremors of unsure etiology at this time.
   - F/U EEG results
   - Family has not officially consented for MRI/MRA with radiology; will
   contact radiology today to assess status of MRI/MRA today
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis;
   unable to isolate an organism at this point.  Diaphoretic although,
   afebrile in last 24 hours. Responds well to tylenol. Patient appears to
   be improving on current Antibiotic regimen
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora,
   - F/U CXR this AM
   - FU Blood cultures; [**6-25**] shows no growth, [**6-27**] set pending
   - Last day of  Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is
   day [**6-12**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to increased metoprolol PVC
s and NSVT overnight; but
   maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent ectopy or stops
   responding to K boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Skin Breakdown: Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around edge of
   cervical collar and unable to remove until negative MRI; Unable to
   assess sacrum as patient unable to move with cervical collar in place.
   - MRI today; if negative, will remove cervical collar and turn patient.
   - Frequent turning after MRI to assess dorsum
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #Respitory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.  RSBI this
   AM 87
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but given his
   depressed mental status will hold for now.
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated for 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.  Will get MRI today.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #.[**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve, who suffered a cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs. He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement in his neurological status over the past week.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is still unclear, and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia, or stroke with AFib. Continuous monitoring and further investigation are necessary to determine the cause.
2. Neurological status: The patient's neurological status is still uncertain, and further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of his brain injury. The presence of muscle fasciculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology is a concern.
3. Fever: The patient's fever is concerning, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. Aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis are possible diagnoses, and cultures are pending.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated on moderate settings, and his lung status is appropriate for weaning. However, his depressed mental status and potential for cardiac complications may necessitate continued mechanical ventilation.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient has developed a stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of his cervical collar, which requires careful management to prevent further deterioration.
6. Left-to-right shunt: The patient's TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of intracardiac shunting, but a left-to-right shunt is suspected. MRI is recommended to further characterize this finding.
7. CAD: The patient has minimal CAD, and his CE levels are down. However, he is on metoprolol and ASA, which may need to be adjusted.
8. Pump failure: The patient's EF is preserved, but his cardiac function may still be compromised.
9. Cervical spine: The patient's CT scan showed no evidence of fracture, but he is unable to remove his cervical collar without MRI or verbalizing pain. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the extent of his cervical spine injury.
10. Liver function: The patient's LFTs are trending down, indicating possible shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

In summary, the patient requires continued close monitoring and management to address these potential complications and optimize his care."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3.5L positive length of stay.  Did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc, but input is much greater
   than output, given continuous tube feeds.
    -Will give 20 mg IV Lasix x 1 and monitor- will give more as needed,
   with goal of even to +300 cc today.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3. Now with left upper
   extremity tremors of unsure etiology at this time.
   - F/U EEG results
   - Family has not officially consented for MRI/MRA with radiology; will
   contact radiology today to assess status of MRI/MRA today
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis;
   unable to isolate an organism at this point.  Diaphoretic although,
   afebrile in last 24 hours. Responds well to tylenol. Patient appears to
   be improving on current Antibiotic regimen
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora,
   - F/U CXR this AM
   - FU Blood cultures; [**6-25**] shows no growth, [**6-27**] set pending
   - Last day of  Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is
   day [**6-12**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to increased metoprolol PVC
s and NSVT overnight; but
   maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent ectopy or stops
   responding to K boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Skin Breakdown: Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around edge of
   cervical collar and unable to remove until negative MRI; Unable to
   assess sacrum as patient unable to move with cervical collar in place.
   - MRI today; if negative, will remove cervical collar and turn patient.
   - Frequent turning after MRI to assess dorsum
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #Respitory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.  RSBI this
   AM 87
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but given his
   depressed mental status will hold for now.
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated for 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.  Will get MRI today.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #.[**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60
   - Trend LFTs
   - BP management as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve, who suffered a possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs. He remains intubated and minimally responsive, with slight improvement in his neurological status over the past week. He has a positive fluid balance, with input exceeding output, and is receiving 20 mg IV lasix to manage this. His cardiac enzymes and LFTs are trending down, and he is being monitored for signs of heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is still unclear, and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia, or stroke with AFib. Further investigation and treatment are needed to determine the cause and prevent future episodes.
2. Neurological Status: The patient's neurological status is improving, but he remains minimally responsive. Further EEG results are pending, and an MRI/MRA has been recommended to further characterize the patient's condition.
3. Fever: The patient's fever is concerning for aspiration PNA or pneumonitis, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause. Sputum cultures and blood cultures are pending.
4. Rhythm: The patient has experienced episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased metoprolol. Further monitoring and treatment are needed to prevent future episodes.
5. Skin Breakdown: The patient has developed a stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of his cervical collar, and further treatment is needed to prevent further breakdown.
6. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and has a moderate RSBI. Weaning from the ventilator is being held due to his depressed mental status.
7. Left to Right Shunt: The patient has a likely secondary left to right shunt due to anomalous pulmonary venous return. An MRI has been recommended to further characterize this condition.
8. CAD: The patient has minimal CAD, and his lipid profile is normal. Further monitoring and treatment are needed to prevent future cardiac events.
9. Pump Failure: The patient's cardiac enzymes and LFTs are trending down, indicating that his heart is not failing at this time.
10. Cervical Spine: The patient's cervical spine is stable, but further evaluation is needed to determine if he has a ligamentous injury.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and LFTs to ensure that his heart is not failing.
2. Further investigate the patient's neurological status and potential causes of his seizures.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's fever and treat any underlying infections.
4. Monitor the patient's rhythm and treat any further episodes of ectopy/NSVT.
5. Continue to treat the patient's skin breakdown and prevent further breakdown.
6. Wean the patient from the ventilator when his mental status improves.
7. Consider further evaluation of the patient's left to right shunt and potential treatment options.
8. Monitor the patient's CAD and lipid profile to prevent future cardiac events.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's pump failure and treat any signs of heart failure.
10. Consider further evaluation of the patient's cervical spine and potential treatment options for any ligamentous injuries."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3.5L positive length of stay.  Did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc, but input is much greater
   than output, given continuous tube feeds.
    -Will give 20 mg IV Lasix x 1 and monitor- will give more as needed,
   with goal of
 500 cc- 1 Liter today.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3. Now with left upper
   extremity tremors of unsure etiology at this time.
   - F/U EEG results
   - Family consented for MRI/MRA; will do this today to assess neuro
   status
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis;
   unable to isolate an organism at this point. WBC decreased to 9.6
   today.  Afebrile in last 24 hours. Responds well to tylenol. Patient
   appears to be improving on current Antibiotic regimen
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora,
   - F/U CXR this AM
   - FU Blood cultures; [**6-25**] shows no growth, [**6-27**] set pending
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**5-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to increased metoprolol PVC
s and NSVT overnight; but
   maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent ectopy or stops
   responding to K boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Skin Breakdown: Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around edge of
   cervical collar and unable to remove until negative MRI; Unable to
   assess sacrum as patient unable to move with cervical collar in place.
   - MRI today; if negative, will remove cervical collar and turn patient.
   - Frequent turning after MRI to assess dorsum
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #Respitory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.  RSBI this
   AM 87
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but given his
   depressed mental status will hold for now.
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated for 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily

   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male wtih history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p possible seizure and cardiac arrest with subsequent
   elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs transfered for further work up.
   He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with slight improvement
   in his neurological status over the past week.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest - The preciptiant of the cardiac arrest is still
   unclear and etiologies suggest arrhythmia, wide-complex tachycardia at
   220 BPM.  (VFib specifically). Stroke with AFib is another possibility,
   but we still cannot assess any deficits at this time given
   unresponsiveness, although there may be a suggestion of PCA infarct on
   EEG. He is 3.5L positive length of stay.  Did not meet goal of -500 cc.
   UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc, but input is much greater
   than output, given continuous tube feeds.
    -Will give 20 mg IV Lasix x 1 and monitor- will give more as needed,
   with goal of
 500 cc- 1 Liter today.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - ECGs in AM
   - Monitor lytes and replete as needed
   .
   #Neuro status: Improvement in neuro status with minor withdrawal to
   pain and more EEG activity; off sedation for 72 hours. CT with signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Presence of muscle
   fasiculations and involuntary movements of unclear etiology, but
   possibly due to central neurological injuries.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3. Now with left upper
   extremity tremors of unsure etiology at this time.
   - F/U EEG results
   - Family consented for MRI/MRA; will do this today to assess neuro
   status
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - CT showed no C-spine fx, cannot r/o ligamentous injury; continue
   collar until neck cleared if awakens or via MRI
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Fever - Concern for aspiration PNA vs. aspiration pneumonitis;
   unable to isolate an organism at this point. WBC decreased to 9.6
   today.  Afebrile in last 24 hours. Responds well to tylenol. Patient
   appears to be improving on current Antibiotic regimen
   - Sputum Cultures: oral flora,
   - F/U CXR this AM
   - FU Blood cultures; [**6-25**] shows no growth, [**6-27**] set pending
   - Continue Levofloxacin (Day 1=[**6-27**]) for total of 7 days; today is day
   [**5-13**].
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continued
   having episodes of ectopy/NSVTlast night and this morning, which have
   responded well to increased metoprolol PVC
s and NSVT overnight; but
   maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent ectopy or stops
   responding to K boluses
   - Serial ECGs
   - Telemetry
   .
   #Skin Breakdown: Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around edge of
   cervical collar and unable to remove until negative MRI; Unable to
   assess sacrum as patient unable to move with cervical collar in place.
   - MRI today; if negative, will remove cervical collar and turn patient.
   - Frequent turning after MRI to assess dorsum
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #Respitory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.  RSBI this
   AM 87
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but given his
   depressed mental status will hold for now.
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated for 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize
   pain.  Will get MRI today.
   .
   #. Alcohol abuse
 No signs of withdrawal, however patient beta
   blocked.
   - CIWA with ativan given shock liver; neuro reccommended to continue
   CIWA.
   .
   #.[**Name (NI) 7334**] LFTs - Pt with shock liver or ischemic hepatitis. LFTs
   continue to trend down, now close to nl in 60

   Disposition: CCU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

* Neurological status: The patient remains minimally responsive and intubated, with some improvement in his neurological status over the past week. He has a GCS score of 6T and is off sedation for 72 hours. His EEG shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.
* Cardiac status: The patient has a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve, and had a cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs. He remains at risk for cardiac arrhythmias and has had episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased metoprolol.
* Respiratory status: The patient is intubated on moderate settings, with a RSBI of 87. His lung status is appropriate for weaning, but given his depressed mental status, it is being held for now.
* Hemodynamic status: The patient has a positive fluid balance, with a net input of 2,084 mL and a net output of 1,480 mL over the past 24 hours. His blood pressure is 118/78 mmHg, and his heart rate is 75 bpm.
* Renal status: The patient's creatinine is 0.9 mg/dL, and his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 28 mg/dL.
* Hepatic status: The patient has a history of shock liver or ischemic hepatitis, and his LFTs are trending down, now close to normal.
* Endocrine status: The patient's glucose is 130 mg/dL, and his electrolytes are within normal limits.
* Infectious disease status: The patient has a fever, and his WBC count is decreasing. He is receiving antibiotics for possible pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis.
* Skin breakdown: The patient has a stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of his cervical collar, and is unable to remove the collar until a negative MRI is obtained.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and has a RSBI of 87. He is at risk for developing respiratory failure.
* Left-to-right shunt: The patient has an anomalous pulmonary venous return, which is likely causing the shunt. An MRI is recommended to further characterize the shunt.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve, and his recent cardiac arrest, make him at risk for cardiac arrhythmias.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's intubation and RSBI of 87 make him at risk for developing respiratory failure.
* Skin breakdown: The patient's stage II pressure ulcer and inability to remove his cervical collar make him at risk for further skin breakdown.
* Infectious disease: The patient's fever and WBC count decreasing make him at risk for developing an infectious disease.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient's anoxic brain injury and history of cardiac arrest make him at risk for neurological deterioration.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Cardiac monitoring: The patient will continue to be monitored for cardiac arrhythmias and will receive metoprolol to control his heart rate.
* Respiratory support: The patient will continue to be intubated and will receive respiratory support as needed.
* Skin care: The patient will receive frequent turning and repositioning to prevent further skin breakdown.
* Infection control: The patient will receive antibiotics for possible pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis, and will have his wound dressed daily.
* Neurological monitoring: The patient will continue to be monitored for neurological deterioration and will receive further evaluation and treatment as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac
   enzymes and LFTs transferred for further work up. He remains minimally
   responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his
   neurological status since admission.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT shows signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.  Neurology has
   discussed poor prognosis with the family, but recommends finishing a 24
   hour EEG monitoring for another assessment of his neuro status.
   - F/U 24 hour EEG results
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - Family meeting regarding decision of extubation vs Trach/PEG.  Wife
   has stated that the patient would not want to be sustained on a
   ventilator long-term.
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  He is 4.3L positive length of stay, +300ml over last 24
   hours. UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc.  Daily goal on
   this patient should be even to slightly positive, as he has many
   insensible losses with NG tube and ventilator.
   - Continue to give Lasix prn for uneven I/O
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - Monitor lytes every 3 days and replete as needed
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.
   Diaphoretic but remains afebrile. Responds well to tylenol.
   - Sputum Cultures showed oral flora
   - All blood cultures final with no growth
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent ectopy
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Need to address whether patient needs Trach/PEG or will undergo
   extubation, as ETT tube causing ulceration in mouth and not able to
   give ideal mouth care
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Respitory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but must first
   address goals of care after 24 hour EEG
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated > 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily stopped in preparation for possible Trach/PEG
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize pain

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest with ventricular arrhythmias. He remains intubated and minimally responsive with no significant improvement in his neurological status since admission. He has been off sedation for over a week and has undergone various diagnostic tests, including a CT scan, which showed signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. The patient has a history of MVP, bicuspid aortic valve, and mitral valve disease. He has been receiving various medications, including Lasix, ranitidine, and metoprolol.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 118/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with a ventilator mode of MMV/PSV/AutoFlow, with a tidal volume of 500 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O.

The patient has developed several complications, including skin breakdown, mouth ulcers, and respiratory failure. He has been given orabase solution for his mouth ulcers and is being turned frequently to prevent further skin breakdown. His lung status is appropriate for weaning, but his care team is waiting for the results of a 24-hour EEG monitor to assess his neurological status before considering extubation.

The patient's family has been informed of his poor prognosis and has discussed the possibility of tracheostomy or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) with the care team. The patient's wife has stated that he would not want to be sustained on a ventilator long-term.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he may develop further complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or respiratory acidosis, if he is not weaned off the ventilator soon.
2. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown is a concern, and further measures may be needed to prevent further skin breakdown and promote healing.
3. Mouth ulcers: The patient's mouth ulcers are causing discomfort and may lead to further complications, such as aspiration or respiratory failure, if not properly managed.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmias may lead to further cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac tamponade or cardiogenic shock, if not properly managed.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is a concern, and further complications, such as seizures or cerebral edema, may develop if his condition does not improve.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory status closely.
2. Consider weaning the patient off the ventilator once his neurological status is assessed and his lung status is stable.
3. Continue to provide wound care and turn the patient frequently to prevent further skin breakdown.
4. Consider tracheostomy or PEG if the patient's respiratory status does not improve and he requires long-term mechanical ventilation.
5. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely and consider further interventions, such as cardiac catheterization or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, if necessary.
6. Continue to provide neurological support and consider further interventions, such as seizure prophylaxis or cerebral edema treatment, if necessary."

   process noted per my read
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac
   enzymes and LFTs transferred for further work up. He remains minimally
   responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his
   neurological status since admission.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT shows signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.  Neurology has
   discussed poor prognosis with the family, but recommends finishing a 24
   hour EEG monitoring for another assessment of his neuro status.
   - F/U 24 hour EEG results
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - Family meeting regarding decision of extubation vs Trach/PEG.  Wife
   has stated that the patient would not want to be sustained on a
   ventilator long-term.
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  He is 4.3L positive length of stay, +300ml over last 24
   hours. UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc.  Daily goal on
   this patient should be even to slightly positive, as he has many
   insensible losses with NG tube and ventilator.
   - Continue to give Lasix prn for uneven I/O
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - Monitor lytes every 3 days and replete as needed
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.
   Diaphoretic but remains afebrile. Responds well to tylenol.
   - Sputum Cultures showed oral flora
   - All blood cultures final with no growth
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent ectopy
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Need to address whether patient needs Trach/PEG or will undergo
   extubation, as ETT tube causing ulceration in mouth and not able to
   give ideal mouth care
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.  RSBI
   attempted this morning but unable to do it due to fast RR and some
   blood-tinged sputum.
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but must first
   address goals of care after 24 hour EEG
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated > 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily stopped in preparation for possible Trach/PEG
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize pain
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: CCU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current status as follows:

1. The patient is a 64-year-old male who suffered a cardiac arrest, intubated, and not responsive.
2. He has been in the ICU for 4.3 days, with a positive fluid balance of 300ml over the last 24 hours.
3. The patient's neurological status remains poor, with minor improvements noted since admission. He has been off sedation for more than a week, and his CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.
4. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which has been treated with a course of levofloxacin. He is diaphoretic but remains afebrile and responds well to tylenol.
5. The patient has a dilated heart with preserved EF, bicuspid aortic valve, and mitral valve disease. He has episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased metoprolol.
6. The patient is developing skin breakdown, including mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT, and a Stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar.
7. The patient is intubated on moderate settings, with an attempted RSBI this morning but unable to do it due to fast RR and some blood-tinged sputum.
8. The patient has a left-to-right shunt, likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return, which cannot be further characterized due to the presence of an intubation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current status include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's lung status is appropriate for weaning, but must first address goals of care after 24-hour EEG monitoring.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated with levofloxacin, but the risk of pneumonia persists, especially with prolonged intubation.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of ventricular arrhythmias, which can recur and worsen his condition.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown, including mouth ulcers and pressure ulcers, can lead to infections and further complications.
5. Left-to-right shunt: The patient's left-to-right shunt can lead to increased pulmonary artery pressure, right ventricular failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Neurological deterioration: The patient's poor neurological status can worsen with prolonged intubation and sedation.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, especially with prolonged intubation and the presence of a central line and urinary catheter.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's cardiac condition, including his dilated heart and mitral valve disease, can lead to further complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.

Given the patient's poor neurological status and the risks associated with prolonged intubation, it is essential to weigh the benefits and risks of further treatment and to involve the patient's family in the decision-making process."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac
   enzymes and LFTs transferred for further work up. He remains minimally
   responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his
   neurological status since admission.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT shows signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.  Neurology has
   discussed poor prognosis with the family, but recommends finishing a 24
   hour EEG monitoring for another assessment of his neuro status.
   - F/U 24 hour EEG results
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - Family meeting regarding decision of extubation vs Trach/PEG.  Wife
   has stated that the patient would not want to be sustained on a
   ventilator long-term.
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   process noted per my read
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac
   enzymes and LFTs transferred for further work up. He remains minimally
   responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his
   neurological status since admission.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT shows signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.  Neurology has
   discussed poor prognosis with the family, but recommends finishing a 24
   hour EEG monitoring for another assessment of his neuro status.
   - F/U 24 hour EEG results
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - Family meeting regarding decision of extubation vs Trach/PEG.  Wife
   has stated that the patient would not want to be sustained on a
   ventilator long-term.
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  He is 4.3L positive length of stay, +300ml over last 24
   hours. UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc.  Daily goal on
   this patient should be even to slightly positive, as he has many
   insensible losses with NG tube and ventilator.
   - Continue to give Lasix prn for uneven I/O
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - Monitor lytes every 3 days and replete as needed
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.
   Diaphoretic but remains afebrile. Responds well to tylenol.
   - Sputum Cultures showed oral flora
   - All blood cultures final with no growth
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent ectopy
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Need to address whether patient needs Trach/PEG or will undergo
   extubation, as ETT tube causing ulceration in mouth and not able to
   give ideal mouth care
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.  RSBI
   attempted this morning but unable to do it due to fast RR and some
   blood-tinged sputum.
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but must first
   address goals of care after 24 hour EEG
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated > 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily stopped in preparation for possible Trach/PEG
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize pain
   .

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: CCU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male who suffered a cardiac arrest and has been intubated and non-responsive. He has been in the ICU for 4.3 days and has had minor improvements in his neurological status, but remains minimally responsive. His CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.

The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Respiratory failure: He is intubated on moderate settings and has a respiratory rate of 25 inspirations per minute. He has been unable to wean from the ventilator due to fast RR and blood-tinged sputum.
2. Cardiac arrest: He is still in cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias and has had multiple episodes of ectopy/NSVT.
3. Pneumonia: He has completed a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia and is still afebrile, but has developed oral flora in his sputum.
4. Skin breakdown: He has developed mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT and has a Stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of his cervical collar.
5. Left to right shunt: He has an anomalous pulmonary venous return, which is likely causing a left to right shunt.
6. CAD: He has minimal CAD and is taking metoprolol and ASA.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events: Had family meeting.  Family wants to extubate, but
   wants to wait until Friday to give family a chance to come and say
   goodbye.  Will readdress tomorrow about timing of extubation.  Also
   state that if he is extubated and breaths on his own, they do not want
   tube feeds or PEG placement.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: CCU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest, currently intubated and in the ICU. The patient remains minimally responsive and has not shown significant improvement in his neurological status since admission.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's RSBI is 121, indicating a high risk of respiratory failure. The patient is intubated, but the RSBI may increase further, leading to respiratory distress.
2. Skin breakdown: The patient has developed mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT and a Stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar. This increases the risk of further skin breakdown and infection.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is at risk of further cardiac events, including arrhythmias and heart failure.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's neurological status is stable, but there is a risk of further deterioration or development of new neurological deficits.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk of developing further infections, particularly in the respiratory and urinary tracts.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk of developing pressure ulcers due to prolonged bedrest and the presence of a cervical collar.
7. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving tube feeds, but there is a risk of malnutrition due to the prolonged duration of intubation and the patient's overall nutritional status.

The patient's current medications include ranitidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis, heparin for DVT prophylaxis, and metoprolol for cardiac arrhythmias. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is currently CCU.

The patient's family is requesting to extubate the patient, but the physician is hesitant due to the patient's unstable condition and the risk of respiratory failure. The patient's family also does not want the patient to receive tube feeds or PEG placement if they are extubated and breathing on their own."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac
   enzymes and LFTs transferred for further work up. He remains minimally
   responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his
   neurological status since admission.
   .
#Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological status sin
ce admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He has been off sedatio
n for more than one week and his CT shows signs of anoxic brain injury without h
emorrhage or shift.  Have ruled out other causes of encephalopathy including B12
, TSH, NH3.  Second video EEG without change, no seizure activity.
   - Family meeting, discuss code status and plan.
   .
   # Comfort Measures: After family is prepared for extubation we will dc
   cervical collar and metoprolol and provide morphine gtt.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.
   -          DC Telemetry.
   -          At this time further lab draws/lasix not indicated.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs. He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission. The patient has had minor improvements in his neurological status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive. He has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated on moderate settings, and his RSBI is 120 this morning, indicating a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Skin Breakdown: The patient is developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT and has a Stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar.
3. Left to Right Shunt: The patient has a most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return, which may lead to further complications.
4. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has had a cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias and has a dilated heart with preserved EF, which may lead to further cardiovascular complications.
5. Infection: The patient has finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia and has low-grade temperatures, which may indicate a risk of infection.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient has had minor improvements in his neurological status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive, which may indicate a risk of further neurological complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider extubation after family has had a chance to visit.
2. Continue to manage the patient's skin breakdown by providing orabase solution, frequent turning, and ensuring an appropriate low-pressure bed.
3. Consider further evaluation of the patient's left to right shunt with an MRI once he is extubated.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and consider further interventions if necessary.
5. Consider further evaluation of the patient's infection risk and consider antibiotics if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and consider further interventions if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac
   enzymes and LFTs transferred for further work up. He remains minimally
   responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his
   neurological status since admission.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT shows signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.  Neurology has
   discussed poor prognosis with the family, but recommends finishing a 24
   hour EEG monitoring for another assessment of his neuro status.
   - F/U 24 hour EEG results
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - Family meeting regarding decision of extubation vs Trach/PEG.  Wife
   has stated that the patient would not want to be sustained on a
   ventilator long-term.
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  He is 4.3L positive length of stay, +300ml over last 24
   hours. UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc.  Daily goal on
   this patient should be even to slightly positive, as he has many
   insensible losses with NG tube and ventilator.
   - Continue to give Lasix prn for uneven I/O
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - Monitor lytes every 3 days and replete as needed
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.
   Diaphoretic but remains afebrile. Responds well to tylenol.
   - Sputum Cultures showed oral flora
   - All blood cultures final with no growth
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent ectopy
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Need to address whether patient needs Trach/PEG or will undergo
   extubation, as ETT tube causing ulceration in mouth and not able to
   give ideal mouth care
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.  RSBI
   attempted this morning but unable to do it due to fast RR and some
   blood-tinged sputum.
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but must first
   address goals of care after 24 hour EEG
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated > 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of
   intracardiac shunting.
   - If awakens, suggest cardiac MRI
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   - Metoprolol 100mg po/ng TID
   - Stop simvastatin 20mg po daily b/c clean coronaries and LDLc is 91
   - ASA 325 mg Daily stopped in preparation for possible Trach/PEG
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - Unable to remove collar without MRI or patient able to verbalize pain

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events: Had family meeting.  Family wants to extubate, but
   wants to wait until Friday to give family a chance to come and say
   goodbye.  Will readdress tomorrow about timing of extubation.  Also
   state that if he is extubated and breaths on his own, they do not want
   tube feeds or PEG placement.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac
   enzymes and LFTs transferred for further work up. He remains minimally
   responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his
   neurological status since admission.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT shows signs of
   anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled out other
   causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.  Neurology has
   discussed poor prognosis with the family, but recommends finishing a 24
   hour EEG monitoring for another assessment of his neuro status.
   - F/U 24 hour EEG results
   - F/U Neuro recs on prognosis
   - Family meeting regarding decision of extubation vs Trach/PEG.  Wife
   has stated that the patient would not want to be sustained on a
   ventilator long-term.
   - Continue to monitor physical exam, responsiveness, response to
   stimuli
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  He is 4.3L positive length of stay, +300ml over last 24
   hours. UOP appropriate for 20 mg IV lasix of 400 cc.  Daily goal on
   this patient should be even to slightly positive, as he has many
   insensible losses with NG tube and ventilator.
   - Continue to give Lasix prn for uneven I/O
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - EP recs: wait to do further investigtion/tx until neurological
   recovery
   - Monitor lytes every 3 days and replete as needed
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.
   Diaphoretic but remains afebrile. Responds well to tylenol.
   - Sputum Cultures showed oral flora
   - All blood cultures final with no growth
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Replete electrolytes PRN
   - Continue metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - EP recommendations if becomes more frequent ectopy
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Need to address whether patient needs Trach/PEG or will undergo
   extubation, as ETT tube causing ulceration in mouth and not able to
   give ideal mouth care
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.  RSBI
   attempted this morning but unable to do it due to fast RR and some
   blood-tinged sputum.
   -Patient
s lung status is appropriate for weaning, but must first
   address goals of care after 24 hour EEG
   -Consider Trach/Peg as patient has been intubated > 10 days ([**6-23**])
   -
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - TTE showed aneurysmal interatrial septum without evidence of

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve who suffered a cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and liver function tests. He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission. The patient has had minor improvements in his neurological status, but is still not meaningfully responsive. He has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which has been treated with levofloxacin, and has finished a course of antibiotics. He has also been diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy and has had episodes of ectopy and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, which have responded well to increased metoprolol. The patient has developed mouth ulcers secondary to the endotracheal tube and has a stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he has been intubated for more than 10 days and may need to be considered for tracheostomy or PEG placement. He also has a left-to-right shunt, which is most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return. An MRI is recommended to further characterize the shunt, but it is not possible with the patient intubated.

The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a preserved ejection fraction and minimal coronary artery disease. He has been taking metoprolol and simvastatin, but the simvastatin has been stopped due to clean coronaries and a low LDL cholesterol level.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated for more than 10 days and may need to be considered for tracheostomy or PEG placement.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has finished a course of antibiotics, but may still be at risk for developing pneumonia again.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and may be at risk for another cardiac arrest.
4. Left-to-Right Shunt: The patient has a left-to-right shunt, which may lead to complications such as heart failure or pulmonary hypertension.
5. Skin Breakdown: The patient has developed mouth ulcers and a stage II pressure ulcer, which may lead to further skin breakdown and infection.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient has had minor improvements in his neurological status, but is still not meaningfully responsive. He may be at risk for further neurological decline or complications.
7. Infection: The patient has been intubated for more than 10 days and may be at risk for developing infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
8. Bleeding: The patient has been taking anticoagulants and may be at risk for bleeding complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider tracheostomy or PEG placement if necessary.
2. Continue to treat the patient's pneumonia with antibiotics and monitor for signs of infection.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and consider further investigation or treatment if necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and consider further investigation or treatment if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's skin breakdown and take measures to prevent further skin breakdown and infection.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and take measures to prevent infection.
7. Consider further investigation or treatment for the patient's left-to-right shunt.
8. Consider further investigation or treatment for the patient's cardiac arrest history."

   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.  Low
   grade temperatures. Responds well to tylenol. Sputum Cultures showed
   oral flora. All blood cultures final with no growth
   - No intervention at this time given patient
s prognosis.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - DC metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - DC cervical collar.
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.
   -Extubation today
   -
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - No intervention at this time.
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac
   enzymes and LFTs transferred for further work up. He remains minimally
   responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his
   neurological status since admission.
   .
#Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological status sin
ce admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He has been off sedatio
n for more than one week and his CT shows signs of anoxic brain injury without h
emorrhage or shift.  Have ruled out other causes of encephalopathy including B12
, TSH, NH3.  Second video EEG without change, no seizure activity.
   - Extubate today.
   .
   # Comfort Measures: After family is prepared for extubation we will dc
   cervical collar and metoprolol and provide morphine gtt.
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.
   -          DC Telemetry.
   -          At this time further lab draws/lasix not indicated.
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.  Low
   grade temperatures. Responds well to tylenol. Sputum Cultures showed
   oral flora. All blood cultures final with no growth
   - No intervention at this time given patient
s prognosis.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - DC metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - DC cervical collar.
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.
   -Extubation today
   -
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - No intervention at this time.
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.

   Disposition: CCU for now<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve, who was transferred to the ICU after cardiac arrest. He remains intubated and minimally responsive, with no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission.

The patient has had minor improvements in his neurological status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive. His CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. He has been off sedation for more than one week, and his second video EEG did not show any seizure activity.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which was treated with levofloxacin, and his sputum cultures showed oral flora. He has also been diagnosed with a dilated heart with preserved EF, bicuspid AS, and mitral valve mixomatous degeneration.

The patient is developing skin breakdown, including mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT, and a Stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar. He has also developed left-to-right shunt, which is likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return.

The patient's cardiac enzymes and LFTs have elevated, and he has had episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased metoprolol.

The patient's medical plan includes extubation today, removal of the cervical collar, and provision of morphine for comfort measures. He will also be given orabase solution to treat his mouth ulcers and will be turned frequently to prevent further skin breakdown.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and may experience respiratory failure if not extubated properly.
2. Skin breakdown: The patient is developing skin breakdown, including mouth ulcers and a Stage II pressure ulcer, which can lead to further complications if not treated promptly.
3. Infection: The patient has pneumonia, which can lead to further complications if not treated promptly.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has had episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which can lead to cardiac arrest if not treated promptly.
5. Neurological decline: The patient's neurological status has not improved since admission, and he may experience further decline if not treated promptly.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has been on tube feeds, which can lead to gastrointestinal complications if not managed properly.
7. Venous thromboembolism: The patient is at risk for venous thromboembolism due to his immobility and the presence of a central line.
8. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk for developing further pressure ulcers due to his immobility and the presence of a cervical collar.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust his treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 64-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs. He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission. The patient has a history of MVP, bicuspid aortic valve, and cardiac arrest. He has been off sedation for over a week and his CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. The patient's condition is complicated by pneumonia, dilated heart, episodes of ectopy/NSVT, skin breakdown, respiratory failure, left to right shunt, and CAD.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated on moderate settings, and extubation is planned for today. There is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient does not tolerate extubation or if the underlying respiratory condition worsens.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has completed a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia, but there is still a risk of pneumonia-related complications, such as sepsis or respiratory failure.
3. Skin Breakdown: The patient has developed mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT and a Stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar. There is a risk of further skin breakdown and potential infection.
4. Left to Right Shunt: The patient has a left to right shunt, which may lead to further cardiac complications, such as pulmonary hypertension or congestive heart failure.
5. CAD: The patient has a history of CAD, which may lead to further cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status remains unstable, and there is a risk of further neurological decline or complications, such as seizures or increased intracranial pressure.
7. Cardiac Arrest: The patient is at risk of further cardiac arrest due to his underlying cardiac conditions and the presence of cardiac arrhythmias.
8. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, such as sepsis or pneumonia, due to his compromised immune system and the presence of tubes and lines.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely after extubation to ensure that he is tolerating the removal of the ETT.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's skin breakdown and take steps to prevent further breakdown and potential infection.
3. Consider further cardiac evaluation to assess the patient's cardiac function and potential cardiac complications.
4. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely for signs of further decline or complications.
5. Consider a palliative care consult to discuss the patient's end-of-life care options with the family.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac arrhythmias and consider further treatment options to manage these complications.
7. Consider a transfer to a palliative care unit for further management of the patient's complex condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve, was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac enzymes and LFTs. He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission. The patient has had minor improvements in his neurological status, but is still not meaningfully responsive. His CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated on moderate settings, and extubation is planned for today. There is a risk of respiratory failure if the patient does not tolerate extubation or if there is a delay in extubation.
2. Neurological Complications: The patient has had minor improvements in his neurological status, but is still not meaningfully responsive. There is a risk of further neurological decline or worsening of his anoxic brain injury.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and has had episodes of ectopy/NSVT. There is a risk of further cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and has been treated with levofloxacin. There is a risk of further infection, particularly if the patient is not properly managed.
5. Skin Breakdown: The patient has developed mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT and has a stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of his cervical collar. There is a risk of further skin breakdown or infection.
6. Left to Right Shunt: The patient has an anomalous pulmonary venous return, which may lead to further complications if not properly managed.
7. Cervical Spine Injury: The patient has a CT scan without evidence of fracture, but there is a risk of further cervical spine injury if the cervical collar is not properly managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and prepare for extubation.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and consider further imaging studies to evaluate the extent of his anoxic brain injury.
3. Continue to manage the patient's cardiovascular status, including monitoring for further cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
4. Continue to manage the patient's infection risk, including monitoring for signs of further infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's skin breakdown, including applying orabase solution and frequent turning to prevent further skin breakdown.
6. Consider further imaging studies to evaluate the extent of the patient's left to right shunt and plan for further management.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cervical spine status and consider further imaging studies to evaluate the extent of any potential injury."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 64 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with subsequent elevation in cardiac
   enzymes and LFTs transferred for further work up. He remains minimally
   responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his
   neurological status since admission.
   .
#Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological status sin
ce admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He has been off sedatio
n for more than one week and his CT shows signs of anoxic brain injury without h
emorrhage or shift.  Have ruled out other causes of encephalopathy including B12
, TSH, NH3.  Second video EEG without change, no seizure activity.
   - Extubate today.
   .
   # Comfort Measures: After family is prepared for extubation we will dc
   cervical collar and metoprolol and provide morphine gtt.
   - Scopalamine 0.5mg TID
   - Morphine IV PRN, Consider changing to gtt
   - Palliative care consult
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.
   -          DC Telemetry.
   -          At this time further lab draws/lasix not indicated.
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.  Low
   grade temperatures. Responds well to tylenol. Sputum Cultures showed
   oral flora. All blood cultures final with no growth
   - No intervention at this time given patient
s prognosis.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - DC metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - DC cervical collar.
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Respiratory Failure: Patient intubated on moderate settings.
   -Extubation today
   -
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but not possible
   with intubation.
   - No intervention at this time.
   .
   #.CAD
 Cath with minimal CAD. CE
s are down
   .
   #.Pump - No signs of heart failure at this time. Preserved EF.
   .
   #Cervical Spine: CT scan without evidence of fracture.
   - DC cervical collar today.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve, who suffered a cardiac arrest and was transferred to the ICU. He remains minimally responsive and intubated, with no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission.

The patient has had minor improvements in his neurological status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive. He has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT scan shows signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. The patient has been ruled out for other causes of encephalopathy, including B12 deficiency, TSH, and NH3.

The patient is expected to be extubated today, and the family has been prepared for this. Comfort measures will be provided, including discontinuation of the cervical collar and metoprolol, and administration of morphine via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump.

The patient has a history of cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias, and is currently being monitored on telemetry. He has also had episodes of ectopy and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), which have responded well to increased metoprolol.

The patient has developed skin breakdown, including mouth ulcers secondary to the endotracheal tube, and a Stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar. The cervical collar will be discontinued, and the patient will be turned frequently to prevent further breakdown.

The patient has a left-to-right shunt, likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return, and an MRI is recommended to further characterize this condition. However, this is not possible at present due to the patient's intubation.

The patient has a history of cardiac catheterization, which showed minimal coronary artery disease. His cardiac enzymes and liver function tests (LFTs) are elevated, and he has been treated with antibiotics for pneumonia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and troponin levels, and decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

The patient's plan of care includes continued monitoring of his neurological status, discontinuation of the cervical collar, and provision of comfort measures. He will be extubated today, and will be transferred to a palliative care unit if his condition worsens.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying lung disease and the need for mechanical ventilation.
* Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is at risk for further cardiac complications, including arrhythmias and heart failure.
* Neurological complications: The patient has a significant neurological injury and is at risk for further decline in his neurological status.
* Skin breakdown: The patient has developed skin breakdown, including mouth ulcers and a Stage II pressure ulcer, and is at risk for further breakdown.
* Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for further infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia.
* Hemodynamic instability: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is at risk for hemodynamic instability, including hypotension and hypertension."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 54 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury and with
   no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission.
   He is now extubated and breathing on his own.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT and EEG shows
   signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled
   out other causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - Patient extubated, still without improvement in neuro status
   .
   # Comfort Measures: Have stopped all medications except comfort meds.
   Now on morphine prn and scopolamine.  Also, written for lorazepam prn
   and tylenol prn.  Appears very comfortable with some difficulty
   managing secretions
   - Scopalamine 0.5mg TID
   - Morphine IV PRN, Consider changing to gtt
   - Palliative care saw patient, will evaluate again on Monday and help
   with placement
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  Still on telemetry.
   - Continue telemetry.
   - At this time further lab draws/lasix not indicated.
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.  Low
   grade temperatures. Responds well to tylenol. Sputum Cultures showed
   oral flora. All blood cultures final with no growth
   - No intervention at this time given patient
s prognosis.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Stopped metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Removed cervical collar.
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but no longer
   indicated in this comfort measures only patient.
   - No intervention at this time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve, who suffered a cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury. The patient remains unresponsive and has not shown significant improvement in his neurological status since admission.

The patient is extubated and breathing on his own, but still requires comfort measures. He is currently on morphine and scopolamine for pain and secretions management. The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a dilated heart and preserved ejection fraction, but he continues to experience episodes of ectopy and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, which have responded well to increased metoprolol.

The patient has developed skin breakdown, including mouth ulcers and a Stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar. He also has a left-to-right shunt, likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return, but this is no longer a priority given his comfort measures-only status.

The patient's lab results show mild anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and mildly elevated liver enzymes. His electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of pneumonia, there is a risk of recurrent infection.
2. Skin breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown can lead to further complications, such as infection or tissue necrosis.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but there is a risk of further arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
4. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status has not improved since admission, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding is a concern, especially given his increased risk of bleeding due to his anticoagulant therapy.

Given the patient's comfort measures-only status, the focus should be on providing palliative care and managing his symptoms. Further intervention should be limited to addressing any complications that arise, such as skin breakdown or gastrointestinal bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 54 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury and with
   no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission.
   He is now extubated and breathing on his own.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT and EEG shows
   signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled
   out other causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - Patient extubated, still without improvement in neuro status
   .
   # Comfort Measures: Have stopped all medications except comfort meds.
   Now on morphine prn and scopolamine.  Also, written for lorazepam prn
   and tylenol prn.  Appears very comfortable with some difficulty
   managing secretions
   - Scopalamine 0.5mg TID
   - Morphine IV PRN, Consider changing to gtt
   - Palliative care saw patient, will evaluate again on Monday and help
   with placement
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  Still on telemetry.
   - Continue telemetry.
   - At this time further lab draws/lasix not indicated.

   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.  Low
   grade temperatures. Responds well to tylenol. Sputum Cultures showed
   oral flora. All blood cultures final with no growth
   - No intervention at this time given patient
s prognosis.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Stopped metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - Telemetry

   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Removed cervical collar.
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I will summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU and identify potential medical complications that can arise.

**Summary of Patient's Health Progress:**

The patient, a 54-year-old male, was admitted to the ICU with severe neurologic injury following cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias. He has been off sedation for more than a week and has shown minor improvements in his neurological status, but remains unresponsive. The patient was extubated yesterday and is breathing independently. He has a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve and has undergone cardiac arrest.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pneumonia:** The patient has a history of pneumonia, and although he has completed a course of levofloxacin, he still has low-grade temperatures. This may indicate a persistent infection, which could lead to further complications.
2. **Cardiac Arrhythmias:** The patient has a history of ventricular arrhythmias, and his rhythm continues to be monitored. He has responded well to increased metoprolol, but there is a risk of further arrhythmias or cardiac complications.
3. **Skin Breakdown:** The patient has developed mouth ulcers and a Stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of his cervical collar. This may lead to further skin breakdown and infection if not properly managed.
4. **Left-to-Right Shunt:** The patient has an anomalous pulmonary venous return, which may lead to further complications if not properly managed.
5. **Neurological Status:** The patient's neurological status remains unchanged, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not properly managed.
6. **Palliative Care:** The patient's prognosis is poor, and he may require palliative care to manage his symptoms and improve his quality of life.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust his medication as needed.
2. Implement measures to prevent further skin breakdown and infection, such as frequent turning and using an orabase solution.
3. Consider further imaging studies, such as an MRI, to better characterize the patient's left-to-right shunt.
4. Continue to manage the patient's pain and symptoms with morphine and scopolamine.
5. Consider transferring the patient to a palliative care unit to improve his quality of life."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 54 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury and with
   no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission.
   He is now extubated and breathing on his own.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT and EEG shows
   signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled
   out other causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - Patient extubated, still without improvement in neuro status
   .
   # Comfort Measures: Have stopped all medications except comfort meds.
   Now on morphine prn and scopolamine.  Also, written for lorazepam prn
   and tylenol prn.  Appears very comfortable with some difficulty
   managing secretions
   - Scopalamine 0.5mg TID
   - Morphine IV PRN, Consider changing to gtt
   - Palliative care saw patient, will evaluate again on Monday and help
   with placement
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  Still on telemetry.
   - Continue telemetry.
   - At this time further lab draws/lasix not indicated.
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.  Low
   grade temperatures. Responds well to tylenol. Sputum Cultures showed
   oral flora. All blood cultures final with no growth
   - No intervention at this time given patient
s prognosis.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Stopped metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Removed cervical collar.
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but no longer
   indicated in this comfort measures only patient.
   - No intervention at this time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Respiratory rate: 28 inspirations per minute (11-28 inspirations per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 93%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

**Neurological Status:**

* Patient is unresponsive, but opens eyes to painful stimuli or light
* Pupils are reactive to 2mm light, but unequal bilaterally
* Babinski reflex is upgoing
* Patient has no meaningful improvement in neurological status since admission

**Medical Complications:**

* Pneumonia: Patient finished a course of levofloxacin and responded well to tylenol
* Cardiac arrest: Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias and is still on telemetry
* Rhythm: Patient has dilated heart with preserved EF, bicuspid AS, and mitral valve mixomatous degeneration, with episodes of ectopy/NSVT
* Skin breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers and stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar
* Left-to-right shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return, but no longer indicated for further characterization

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Respiratory failure: Patient is at risk for respiratory failure due to pneumonia and cardiac arrest
* Sepsis: Patient is at risk for sepsis due to pneumonia and cardiac arrest
* Cardiac arrhythmias: Patient is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias due to cardiac arrest and rhythm disturbances
* Skin infections: Patient is at risk for skin infections due to skin breakdown and mouth ulcers
* Neurological deterioration: Patient is at risk for neurological deterioration due to anoxic brain injury and lack of meaningful improvement in neurological status

**Plan:**

* Continue telemetry and monitor for cardiac arrhythmias
* Continue antibiotics for pneumonia
* Manage skin breakdown with orabase solution, frequent turning, and low-pressure bed
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and respiratory failure
* Consider transfer to palliative care unit for comfort measures only patient."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 54 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury and with
   no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission.
   He is now extubated and breathing on his own.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT and EEG shows
   signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled
   out other causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - Patient extubated, still without improvement in neuro status
   .
   # Comfort Measures: Have stopped all medications except comfort meds.
   Now on morphine prn and scopolamine.  Also, written for lorazepam prn
   and tylenol prn.
   - Scopalamine 0.5mg TID
   - Morphine IV PRN, Consider changing to gtt
   - Palliative care saw patient, will evaluated again on Monday and help
   with placement
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  Still on telemetry.
   - Continue telemetry.
   - At this time further lab draws/lasix not indicated.
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.  Low
   grade temperatures. Responds well to tylenol. Sputum Cultures showed
   oral flora. All blood cultures final with no growth
   - No intervention at this time given patient
s prognosis.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Stopped metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Removed cervical collar.
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male who suffered a severe neurologic injury following a cardiac arrest. He has been in the ICU for an extended period and has shown minimal improvement in his neurological status.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 132/68 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%. He is intubated and on a ventilator, with a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination reveals a unresponsive patient with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3. He has 3 mm reactive pupils, and his neck is supple with no jugular venous distension or carotid bruits. His lungs are clear, and his abdomen is soft and non-tender.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.9 K/μL, hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 534 K/μL. His electrolytes are within normal limits, with a potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, sodium level of 137 mg/dL, and chloride level of 103 mEq/L. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 36 mg/dL, and his creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show signs of anoxic brain injury on his computed tomography (CT) and electroencephalogram (EEG). His echocardiogram shows a dilated heart with preserved ejection fraction, and his sputum cultures showed oral flora.

The patient's medical conditions include a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve, and he has had a cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias. He has also developed a stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of his cervical collar.

The patient's plan of care includes continued telemetry monitoring, comfort measures, and palliative care. He is on morphine and scopolamine for pain and anxiety, and his tube feeds have been stopped. His skin breakdown is being managed with orabase solution and frequent turning, and his left to right shunt is being monitored.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's low-grade temperatures and oral flora on his sputum cultures suggest a possible pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's prolonged ICU stay and presence of central lines and urinary catheters increase his risk of developing sepsis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing need for mechanical ventilation and his history of cardiac arrest increase his risk of developing respiratory failure.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of ventricular arrhythmias and his ongoing telemetry monitoring suggest a risk of developing further cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient's stage II pressure ulcer and his ongoing need for mechanical ventilation increase his risk of developing further skin breakdown.
6. Neurological deterioration: The patient's anoxic brain injury and ongoing neurological deficits increase his risk of further neurological deterioration.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires ongoing monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 54 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury and with
   no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission.
   He is now extubated and breathing on his own.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT and EEG shows
   signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled
   out other causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - Patient extubated, still without improvement in neuro status
   .
   # Comfort Measures: Have stopped all medications except comfort meds.
   Now on morphine prn and scopolamine.  Also, written for lorazepam prn
   and tylenol prn.
   - Scopalamine 0.5mg TID
   - Morphine IV PRN, Consider changing to gtt
   - Palliative care saw patient, will evaluated again on Monday and help
   with placement
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  Still on telemetry.
   - Continue telemetry.
   - At this time further lab draws/lasix not indicated.
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.  Low
   grade temperatures. Responds well to tylenol. Sputum Cultures showed
   oral flora. All blood cultures final with no growth
   - No intervention at this time given patient
s prognosis.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Stopped metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Removed cervical collar.
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but no longer
   indicated in this comfort measures only patient.
   - No intervention at this time.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve who suffered a cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury. The patient is currently extubated and breathing on his own, but his neurologic status has not improved meaningfully since admission.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 132/68 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's respiratory support is on standby, with a ventilation mode set to 500 mL and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3, with pupils that are 3mm and reactive to 2mm light. The patient's neck is supple, and there are no carotid bruits or jugular venous distension (JVD). The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no masses or rebound/guarding.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 534 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with a sodium level of 137 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L, and chloride level of 103 mEq/L.

The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a sinus rhythm and a dilated heart in echocardiogram. The patient has had episodes of ectopy and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), which have responded well to increased metoprolol.

The patient's skin breakdown is significant, with mouth ulcers secondary to the endotracheal tube (ETT) and a Stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar. The patient's left upper extremity is posturing, and there is slight skin breakdown behind the neck where the collar was rubbing.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Neurologic deterioration: The patient's neurologic status has not improved meaningfully since admission, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia, and there is a risk of recurrence or development of new infections.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has had episodes of ectopy and NSVT, and there is a risk of further arrhythmias.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient has significant skin breakdown, including mouth ulcers and a Stage II pressure ulcer, which can lead to infection and further complications.
5. Left-to-right shunt: The patient has a suspected left-to-right shunt, which can lead to further complications and worsening of his condition.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 11.8 g/dL, which is below the normal range.
7. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 534 K/uL, which is below the normal range.

Based on the patient's condition, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's neurologic status closely and adjust his care plan accordingly.
2. Consider further evaluation of the patient's cardiac status, including echocardiogram and stress test, to assess for any underlying cardiac conditions that may be contributing to his condition.
3. Continue to provide supportive care, including oxygen therapy, pain management, and skin care, to prevent further complications.
4. Consider transferring the patient to a palliative care unit to focus on his comfort and quality of life.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results and adjust his care plan accordingly.
6. Consider further evaluation of the patient's skin breakdown, including wound care and prevention of further complications.
7. Consider further evaluation of the patient's left-to-right shunt, including MRI and echocardiogram, to assess for any underlying cardiac conditions that may be contributing to his condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 54 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury and with
   no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission.
   He is now extubated and breathing on his own.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT and EEG shows
   signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled
   out other causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - Patient extubated, still without improvement in neuro status
   .
   # Comfort Measures: Have stopped all medications except comfort meds.
   Now on morphine prn and scopolamine.  Also, written for lorazepam prn
   and tylenol prn.  Appears very comfortable with some difficulty
   managing secretions
   - Scopalamine 0.5mg TID
   - Morphine IV PRN
   - Palliative care saw patient, will evaluate again on Monday and help
   with placement
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  Still on telemetry.
   - Continue telemetry.
   - At this time further lab draws/lasix not indicated.
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.  Low
   grade temperatures. Responds well to tylenol. Sputum Cultures showed
   oral flora. All blood cultures final with no growth
   - No intervention at this time given patient
s prognosis.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Stopped metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Removed cervical collar
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but no longer
   indicated in this comfort measures only patient.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve who suffered an anoxic brain injury following cardiac arrest. He remains unresponsive and has not shown meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 143/94 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 30 inspirations per minute. He is breathing independently and has a SpO2 of 92% on room air.

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds throughout the lungs, a III/VI systolic murmur, and no masses or rebound/guarding in the abdomen. His skin shows slight breakdown behind the neck and burn marks from defibrillator pads.

The patient's laboratory results show no new labs, and his assessment and plan include the following:

* Neuro status: The patient has had minor improvements in his neurological status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.
* Comfort measures: The patient is on morphine prn and scopolamine, and has been written for lorazepam prn and tylenol prn. He appears very comfortable, but has difficulty managing secretions.
* Cardiac arrest: The patient is still on telemetry and has had episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased metoprolol.
* Pneumonia: The patient has finished a course of levofloxacin and has responded well to tylenol.
* Skin breakdown: The patient is developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT and has a Stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar.
* Left to right shunt: The patient is most likely experiencing a left to right shunt secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return, but this is no longer being treated due to the patient's comfort measures only status.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's coarse breath sounds and difficulty managing secretions increase his risk of respiratory failure.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and ongoing episodes of ectopy/NSVT increase his risk of further cardiac complications.
* Skin breakdown: The patient's Stage II pressure ulcer and skin breakdown around the edge of the cervical collar increase his risk of further skin complications.
* Infection: The patient's history of pneumonia and ongoing respiratory support increase his risk of developing further infections.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient's ongoing neurological injury and lack of meaningful improvement in his neurological status increase his risk of further neurological deterioration."

Summary:

The patient, a 54-year-old male, is a cardiac arrest survivor with severe anoxic brain injury and no meaningful improvement in neurological status since admission. He is extubated and breathing on his own, but still not responding to commands. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 116 bpm, and blood pressure of 143/94 mmHg. He has a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve and is currently on comfort measures only.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status has not improved since admission, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. Respiratory complications: Although the patient is breathing on his own, he may still require respiratory support, and there is a risk of respiratory failure.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and is still at risk of arrhythmias.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient has developed mouth ulcers and a Stage II pressure ulcer, which may worsen if not properly managed.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and may be at risk of developing further infections.
6. Left to Right Shunt: The patient has an anomalous pulmonary venous return, which may lead to further complications if not properly managed.

Plan:

1. Continue comfort measures only, including morphine and scopolamine as needed.
2. Monitor the patient's neurological status and respiratory function closely.
3. Manage the patient's skin breakdown by frequent turning, using orabase solution, and ensuring an appropriate low-pressure bed.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular function and arrhythmias closely.
5. Consider transfer to a palliative care unit if the patient's condition does not improve."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve, who suffered a cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury. He is currently in the ICU and has been extubated, breathing independently, and appears comfortable.

The patient's neurological status remains unchanged, with minor improvements since admission, but still not meaningfully responsive. He has been off sedation for over a week, and his CT and EEG show signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. Other causes of encephalopathy have been ruled out.

The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a dilated heart on echocardiogram, preserved EF, and mixed mitral valve disease. He has episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which respond well to increased metoprolol.

The patient has developed skin breakdown, including mouth ulcers and a Stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of the cervical collar. He has also developed left-to-right shunt, likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return.

The patient's comfort measures include stopping all medications except for comfort meds, such as morphine and scopolamine. He is currently on palliative care, and a decision will be made about transferring him to a palliative care unit.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of neurologic status: The patient's neurological status remains unchanged, and further deterioration is possible.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has had episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which could worsen and lead to cardiac arrest.
3. Skin breakdown: The patient has developed skin breakdown, including mouth ulcers and a Stage II pressure ulcer, which could worsen and lead to further complications.
4. Left-to-right shunt: The patient has a left-to-right shunt, which could lead to further complications, such as pulmonary hypertension and heart failure.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia, and further infection could arise, particularly given his compromised immune system.
6. Respiratory compromise: The patient is breathing independently, but could experience respiratory compromise due to his underlying condition and potential for further deterioration.
7. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's cardiac status is stable, but could become unstable due to further deterioration or complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and address any potential complications promptly to ensure his comfort and quality of life."

   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury and with
   no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission.
   He is now extubated and breathing on his own.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT and EEG shows
   signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled
   out other causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - Patient extubated, still without improvement in neuro status
   .
   # Comfort Measures: Have stopped all medications except comfort meds.
   Now on morphine prn and scopolamine.  Also, written for lorazepam prn
   and tylenol prn.  Appears very comfortable with some difficulty
   managing secretions

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve, who suffered a cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury. He is currently extubated and breathing on his own, but remains unresponsive and has not shown meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission. He has been off sedation for over a week and his CT and EEG show signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. The patient has developed some minor improvements in his neurological status, but is still not responding to commands. He has been started on comfort measures, including morphine and scopolamine, and is being managed with palliative care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying neurological injury and potential for aspiration.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is still at risk for developing further infections, particularly given his compromised immune system.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and continues to have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which may require further management.
4. Skin breakdown: The patient has developed skin breakdown around the edge of his cervical collar and is at risk for further skin breakdown due to his immobility and compromised skin integrity.
5. Left-to-right shunt: The patient has a likely left-to-right shunt secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return, which may require further evaluation and management.
6. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk for developing pressure ulcers due to his immobility and compromised skin integrity.
7. Malnutrition: The patient has stopped tube feeds and may be at risk for malnutrition, particularly given his compromised nutritional status.
8. Glycemic control: The patient's glycemic control is being managed without fingersticks, which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
9. VAP: The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to his immobility and compromised respiratory status.
10. DVT: The patient has stopped heparin and is at risk for developing DVT, particularly given his immobility and compromised circulatory status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 54-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve, suffered a cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias and has been in the ICU for an extended period. He has had minor improvements in his neurological status since admission but remains unresponsive. The patient is extubated and breathing on his own, but his neurological status has not improved. He has been off sedation for over a week and has shown signs of anoxic brain injury on CT and EEG. The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a dilated heart and preserved EF, but he continues to experience episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded to increased metoprolol. He has a left-to-right shunt, likely due to anomalous pulmonary venous return, and has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which has responded to treatment. The patient has developed skin breakdown, including mouth ulcers and a Stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of his cervical collar.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever and pneumonia diagnosis put him at risk for developing sepsis.
2. Skin Breakdown: The patient's skin breakdown, including mouth ulcers and a Stage II pressure ulcer, requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.
3. Respiratory Complications: The patient's pneumonia and left-to-right shunt may lead to respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure or pneumonia progression.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of cardiac arrest and ventricular arrhythmias, combined with his ongoing cardiac issues, may lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's anoxic brain injury and ongoing neurological issues may lead to further neurological deterioration, including increased risk of seizures, stroke, or brain death.
6. Infection: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and immunosuppression make him susceptible to infections, including catheter-related infections or hospital-acquired pneumonia.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's prolonged tube feeding cessation and lack of enteral nutrition may lead to malnutrition, which can exacerbate his underlying medical conditions.

Recommendations:

1. Continue close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure.
2. Manage the patient's skin breakdown with regular turning, pressure ulcer care, and orabase solution.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider intubation if necessary.
4. Manage the patient's cardiac status with continued telemetry and consideration of further cardiac interventions if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and consider further imaging or interventions if necessary.
6. Consider further nutrition support, such as enteral nutrition or parenteral nutrition, to prevent malnutrition.
7. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of sepsis and infection, and consider further antibiotics or other interventions if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of MVP and bicuspid aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury. He has been extubated and is breathing on his own, but has not shown meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission. He has minor improvements in his neurological status, but is still not responsive. The patient has been off sedation for over a week and his CT and EEG show signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift. He has been ruled out for other causes of encephalopathy.

The patient is currently on comfort measures only, with medications stopped except for comfort meds, morphine prn, and scopolamine. He is being managed with lorazepam prn and tylenol prn. The patient has a code status of CMO, DNR/DNI, and is being considered for transfer to a palliative care unit.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is a concern, as he is still on oxygen therapy and has a history of cardiac arrest. There is a risk of respiratory failure, especially if his neurological status worsens.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of ventricular arrhythmias and is still on telemetry. There is a risk of cardiac arrhythmias, especially if his cardiac function worsens.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a fever and is at risk of developing sepsis, especially if his immune system is compromised due to his neurological injury.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is still at risk of developing further respiratory infections.
5. Skin breakdown: The patient has skin breakdown around the edge of his cervical collar and is at risk of further skin breakdown, especially if his mobility is limited.
6. Left to right shunt: The patient has a left to right shunt, which may be secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return. This may lead to further complications, such as pulmonary edema or heart failure.
7. Neurological deterioration: The patient's neurological status is still deteriorating, and there is a risk of further neurological deterioration, especially if his cardiac function worsens.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust his oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust his medications as needed.
3. Continue to manage the patient's pain and discomfort with comfort meds and scopolamine.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's skin breakdown and adjust his positioning and pressure ulcer care as needed.
5. Consider further evaluation of the patient's left to right shunt with MRI or echocardiogram to better characterize the anatomy and potential complications.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status closely and adjust his medications and care plan as needed.
7. Consider transfer to a palliative care unit to better manage the patient's comfort and symptoms."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 7331**] is a 54 year old male with history of MVP and bicuspid
   aortic valve s/p cardiac arrest with severe neurologic injury and with
   no meaningful improvement in his neurological status since admission.
   He is now extubated and breathing on his own.
   .
   #Neuro status: Patient has had minor improvements in his neurological
   status since admission, but is still not meaningfully responsive.  He
   has been off sedation for more than one week and his CT and EEG shows
   signs of anoxic brain injury without hemorrhage or shift.  Have ruled
   out other causes of encephalopathy including B12, TSH, NH3.
   - Patient extubated, still without improvement in neuro status
   .
   # Comfort Measures: Have stopped all medications except comfort meds.
   Now on morphine prn and scopolamine.  Also, written for lorazepam prn
   and tylenol prn.  Appears very comfortable with some difficulty
   managing secretions
   - Scopalamine 0.5mg TID
   - Morphine IV PRN
   - Palliative care saw patient, will evaluate again on Monday and help
   with placement
   .
   #. Cardiac arrest
 Patient is s/p cardiac arrest due to ventricular
   arrhythmias.  Still on telemetry.
   - Continue telemetry.
   - At this time further lab draws/lasix not indicated.
   .
   #. Pneumonia
 Finished a course of levofloxacin for pneumonia.  Low
   grade temperatures. Responds well to tylenol. Sputum Cultures showed
   oral flora. All blood cultures final with no growth
   - No intervention at this time given patient
s prognosis.
   .
   #. Rhythm - Dilated heart in echocardiogram in pt with preserved EF,
   bicuspid AS and mixomatous degeneration of mitral valve. Continues to
   have episodes of ectopy/NSVT, which have responded well to increased
   metoprolol.  Has otherwise maintained sinus rhythm.
   - Stopped metoprolol 100 mg TID
   - Telemetry
   .
   #.Skin Breakdown: Patient developing mouth ulcers secondary to the ETT;
   given orabase solution.  Patient with Stage II pressure ulcer around
   edge of cervical collar and unable to remove per neurology.
   - Removed cervical collar
   - Continue orabase solution
   - Frequent turning
   - Ensure appropriate low pressure bed
   .
   #.Left to Right Shunt: Most likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary
   venous return. MRI recommended to further characterize but no longer
   indicated in this comfort measures only patient.
   - No intervention at this time.

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of mitral valve prolapse and bicuspid aortic valve who suffered cardiac arrest and severe neurologic injury. He has been admitted to the ICU and has been extubated, but remains non-meaningfully responsive. His neurological status has shown minor improvements, but he is still not following commands. He has been off sedation for over a week and has had no meaningful improvement in his neurological status.

The patient has a number of medical conditions, including pneumonia, which has been treated with levofloxacin, and a left-to-right shunt, which is likely secondary to anomalous pulmonary venous return. He also has a dilated heart with preserved ejection fraction and mitral valve mixomatous degeneration.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 103.0°F (39.4°C)
* Heart rate: 120 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 126/75 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 36 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 83%
* White blood cell count: 13.9 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 11.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 534 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 36 mg/dL
* Glucose: 137 mg/dL

The patient is receiving comfort measures only, including morphine prn, scopolamine, and lorazepam prn. He is also receiving tylenol prn and has been prescribed orabase solution for mouth ulcers. He has a stage II pressure ulcer around the edge of his cervical collar and is unable to remove it due to his neurologic injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia: The patient has a history of pneumonia and may be at risk for further infection.
* Left-to-right shunt: The patient has a left-to-right shunt, which can lead to heart failure and other complications.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has had episodes of ectopy and NSVT, which can be life-threatening.
* Skin breakdown: The patient has skin breakdown and pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection and other complications.
* Neurological deterioration: The patient has severe neurologic injury and may be at risk for further deterioration.
* Respiratory failure: The patient is extubated and may be at risk for respiratory failure.
* Cardiovascular instability: The patient has a history of cardiac arrest and may be at risk for further cardiovascular instability."
