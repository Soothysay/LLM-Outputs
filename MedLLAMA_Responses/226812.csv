   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 79 year old female with past medical history of
   hypertension and depression who presented with several days of chest
   pain, found to have a NSTEMI, and now s/p cath with 3VD, transferred to
   CCU for closer monitoring and BP control.
   .
   # Chest pain/CORONARIES: Now s/p cath which revealed 3VD. Will likely
   need bypass surgery. Nitro gtt if needed for further chest pain.
   - continue to cycle cardiac enzymes
   - CT surgery c/s to evaluate for need for bypass
   - continue ASA, hold plavix given need for upcoming bypass surgery,
   beta-blocker, integrillin drip until the AM, statin
   - Titrate nitroglycerin drip to pain free and adequate BP control
   - serial EKGs
   .
   # PUMP:
   - continue BB and [**Last Name (un) 284**], TTE in AM to assess EF
   .
   # RHYTHM: Mostly sinus but one episode of VT lasting 3min.  VT likely
   reactive to ongoing ischemia.
   - If VT returns, would consider lidocaine if stable BP.  Cardiovert of
   hypotension
   - Continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Depression: Continue Wellbutrin.
   - consider social work c/s if needed
   .
   # Hypertension: Patient has history of hypertension, per report has
   been quite labile, also likely [**2-23**] cardiac dysfunction. Renal U/S was
   negative for renal artery stenosis.
   - Continue diovan and BB
   - nitro gtt as needed, goal SBP 120 to 150 and DBP > 60 for adequate
   coronary perfusion
   .
   # Epistaxis - One episode which resolved. OK to restart integrillin. If
   further bleeding, will c/s ENT.
   .
   # FEN: cardiac healthy diet

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient has been admitted to the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) for closer monitoring and blood pressure control.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 132/58 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is 19 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation is 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, with a troponin-T level of 1.75 ng/mL, and a creatine kinase (CK) level of 306 U/L. The patient's electrocardiogram (EKG) shows a sinus rhythm with a rate of 70 beats per minute.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.5 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 33.7%
* Platelet count: 261 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 7.4 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 24 mEq/L
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: potassium 4.3 mEq/L, magnesium 1.9 mg/dL, and phosphorus 3.1 mg/dL

The patient's medications include:

* Nitroglycerin drip for chest pain and blood pressure control
* Eptifibatide infusion for antiplatelet therapy
* Metoprolol for beta-blockade
* Aspirin for antiplatelet therapy
* Atorvastatin for lipid-lowering therapy
* BuPROPion for depression
* Pantoprazole for gastroesophageal reflux disease
* Docusate sodium for constipation
* Valsartan for blood pressure control

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia, due to ongoing ischemia
* Hypotension or shock due to cardiac dysfunction or medication side effects
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury due to hypovolemia or medication side effects
* Respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome due to pulmonary edema or pneumonia
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to anticoagulant therapy or medication side effects
* Infection, such as sepsis or pneumonia, due to immunosuppression or invasive procedures

It is essential to monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and cardiac enzymes closely to detect any potential complications early and intervene promptly to prevent adverse outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension and depression, who presented with several days of chest pain and was diagnosed with a Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI). She underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed 3-vessel disease, and is currently being monitored in the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU). The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 132/58 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is receiving nitroglycerin and eptifibatide infusions, as well as other medications to manage her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's 3-vessel disease may lead to further cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient's epistaxis and the need for ongoing anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or hematuria.
3. Infection: The patient's recent cardiac catheterization and hospitalization may increase her risk of developing an infection, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection.
4. Renal complications: The patient's hypertension and cardiac disease may increase her risk of developing renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may worsen, leading to respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's depression and recent cardiac event may increase her risk of developing neurological complications, such as stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent cardiac event and hospitalization may increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or constipation.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is stable, and she is being closely monitored in the CCU. The plan is to continue to manage her cardiac condition with nitroglycerin and eptifibatide infusions, as well as other medications to manage her symptoms and prevent complications. The patient's bleeding risk will be closely monitored, and she will be assessed for any signs of bleeding or infection. The patient's renal function will be closely monitored, and she will be assessed for any signs of renal compromise. The patient's respiratory status will be closely monitored, and she will be assessed for any signs of respiratory distress. The patient's neurological status will be closely monitored, and she will be assessed for any signs of neurological compromise."

   Chief Complaint: Patient is a 79 year old female with past medical
   history of hypertension and depression who presented with several days
   of chest pain, found to have a NSTEMI, and now s/p cath with 3VD,
   transferred to CCU for closer monitoring and BP control
   24 Hour Events:
   Several runs of self terminated, asymptomatic slow VT. No EKG obtained.
   ECHO - The left atrium is elongated. There is symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and
   tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
   dysfunction. There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest
   or with Valsalva. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
   is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint: Patient is a 79 year old female with past medical
   history of hypertension and depression who presented with several days
   of chest pain, found to have a NSTEMI, and now s/p cath with 3VD,
   transferred to CCU for closer monitoring and BP control
   24 Hour Events:
   Tele->1min bigemeny followed by 3 min V tach (broke seconds before EKG
   was ready).
   ECHO - The left atrium is elongated. There is symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and
   tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
   dysfunction. There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest
   or with Valsalva. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
   is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Physiologic mitral
   regurgitation is seen (within normal limits). The left ventricular
   inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a
   trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a past medical history of hypertension and depression, who presented with several days of chest pain and was found to have a Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI). She underwent a cardiac catheterization, which revealed 3-vessel disease (3VD). She is currently in the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) for closer monitoring and blood pressure control. Her current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and pantoprazole.

Physical Examination:

The patient is in normal sinus rhythm, with a heart rate of 68 beats per minute. Her blood pressure is 142/62 mmHg, and her oxygen saturation is 96%. She has a normal respiratory rate, and her lungs are clear. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and her extremities are warm and well-perfused.

Laboratory Results:

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, with a peak level of 1.75 ng/mL. Her creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB levels are elevated, with a peak level of 201 IU/L. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are normal. Her complete blood count (CBC) shows a mild anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 11.9 g/dL.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient is at risk for cardiac complications, including recurrent myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmias, and heart failure. She is also at risk for bleeding complications due to her anticoagulation therapy. The plan is to continue her anticoagulation therapy and monitor her for signs of bleeding. She will also be monitored for signs of cardiac complications, including chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations.

Potential Medical Complications:
