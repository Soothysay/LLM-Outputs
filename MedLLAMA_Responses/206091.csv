You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including gastrointestinal bleeding, hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction, and alcohol poisoning. They have received thiamine repletion and D50 for hypoglycemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, and blood pressure of 112/56 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and have a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating cardiac injury, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of myocardial infarction and elevated troponin levels, there is a high risk of cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
2. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and history of gastrointestinal bleeding increase their risk of developing infections, including sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding poses a risk of further hemorrhage, hypovolemic shock, and potential for life-threatening complications.
4. Neurological sequelae: The patient's altered mental status may be a sign of neurological damage, which could progress to more severe complications, including brain herniation, seizures, and coma.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest potential kidney injury, which could worsen and lead to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
6. Liver dysfunction: The patient's abnormal liver function tests may indicate liver damage, which could progress to more severe liver failure.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of hypoglycemia and ongoing glucose instability pose a risk of further episodes of hypoglycemia, which could lead to neurological damage, seizures, and even death.
8. DVT and VAP: The patient's immobility and mechanical ventilation increase their risk of developing deep vein thrombosis and ventilator-associated pneumonia, which could lead to life-threatening complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 63-inch tall individual admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleeding, hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction, and poisoning due to alcohol intoxication. The patient received repleted thiamine and 1/2 amp D50 for hypoglycemia. They also received 1U PRBC for anemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98Â°F, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 112/56 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable, with no acute distress, asterixis, or signs of organ failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and gastrointestinal bleeding may increase the risk of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and mortality.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of myocardial infarction and acute alcohol intoxication may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and mortality.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may worsen, leading to hemorrhagic shock, coagulopathy, and increased risk of complications.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of hypoglycemia may lead to recurrent episodes, which could worsen if not properly managed.
5. Thiamine Deficiency: The patient's thiamine deficiency may worsen if not properly treated, leading to Wernicke's encephalopathy, Korsakoff's psychosis, and other complications.
6. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's history of alcohol intoxication and gastrointestinal bleeding may increase the risk of acute kidney injury, which could worsen if not properly managed.
7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome may increase the risk of respiratory failure, which could worsen if not properly managed.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with Hep C & ETOH cirrhosis who presented with 1 day of BRBPR
   and was found to have elevated anion gap, glucose 55 and ETOH level
   145.
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Multiple possible etiologies for elevated gap.
   Lactate elevated at 4.4, ETOH level 145 with serum osms of 340, urine
   ketones positive.  Given h/o poor po intake, ETOH abuse and cirrhosis,
   suspect this is due alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis.  Lactate
   improving after hydration.
   - received thiamine 100mg IV followed by dextrose for low BS
   - received banana bag followed by D5 1/2NS
   - continue D5 1/2NS until nutritional status improves
   - trend lactate and ABGs
   - monitor MS
   .
   # BRBPR: Pt underwent EGD in [**1-2**] that revealed gastritis &
   duodenitis, colonoscopy in [**10-3**] was normal.  Hct has been stable with
   IVF and HD stable.  Suspect that may be a slow bleed due to gastritis
   or possible hemorrhoids.  No frank melena on exam to suggest brisk
   upper GI bleed.  INR elevated at 2.1 on presentation in setting of GI
   bleed.
   - NPO for now, apprec GI recs
   - IV Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - typed and crossed for 2u prbcs
   - trend hct q6hrs, transfuse if acute hct drop or hct<21 (tx 1U PRBC on
   [**3-8**])
   - given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed, will trend plts
   - admin Vitamin K 10mg po x 3 days
   - PIV x 2
   .
   # ETOH level/withdrawl: Pt with poor nutrition status and long history
   of ETOH abuse. She denies h/o withdrawal and current ETOH level of
   145.  Will place on CIWA scale for now.  Required total of 4mg IV
   Ativan [**3-8**] PM.
   - CIWA scale
   - Ativan 1mg q2hr prn CIWA >10
   - Banana bag with MVI, folate, thiamine
   .
   # Cocaine Abuse: Pt with long history of substance abuse and tox screen
   + for cocaine.  Pt has a h/o NSTEMI in setting of cocaine abuse. Pt
   currently denying CP, EKGs unchanged from prior.
   - cardiac enzymes negative
   - monitor on telemetry
   - no aspirin given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed
   - SW consult in am
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: Pt reports poor po intake, concern for
   alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis given elevated gap and low BS.
   - received thiamine 100mg IV to prevent Wernickes
   - dextrose [**1-27**] amp after thiamine
   -  D5 1/2NS IVF
   - hold on insulin regimen
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely due ETOH abuse, essentially at baseline.
   However, given GI bleed, would consider plt transfusion if dropping hct
   or plt count
   - transfuse 1u plts prn
   - f/u plt count
   .
   # FEN: NPO for now
   - s/p Thiamine 100mg IV, banana bag and D5 1/2NS
   - aggressive electrolyte repletion
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and ethanol (EtOH) cirrhosis who presented with 1 day of bloody stools and was found to have elevated anion gap, glucose 55, and EtOH level 145. The patient has been diagnosed with anion gap acidosis, likely due to alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis, and is being treated with hydration, thiamine, and dextrose.

The patient has also been diagnosed with a bleeding gastritis and duodenitis, likely caused by the EtOH abuse, and is being treated with proton pump inhibitors and blood transfusions as needed. The patient is also being monitored for thrombocytopenia and is being treated with vitamin K.

The patient has a history of substance abuse, including cocaine, and has been diagnosed with a past NSTEMI in the setting of cocaine abuse. The patient is being monitored on telemetry and is being treated with aspirin.

The patient has also been diagnosed with hypoglycemia and is being treated with thiamine and dextrose. The patient is being monitored for electrolyte imbalances and is being treated with aggressive electrolyte repletion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Wernicke's encephalopathy: due to thiamine deficiency, which can lead to confusion, memory loss, and seizures.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: due to liver failure, which can lead to confusion, disorientation, and coma.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: due to gastritis and duodenitis, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and require blood transfusions.
4. Thrombocytopenia: due to EtOH abuse, which can lead to bleeding complications.
5. Lactic acidosis: due to the patient's metabolic state, which can lead to metabolic acidosis and require treatment with bicarbonate.
6. Hypoglycemia: due to the patient's poor nutritional status, which can lead to hypoglycemic seizures and coma.
7. Electrolyte imbalances: due to the patient's metabolic state, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
8. Infection: due to the patient's immunocompromised state, which can lead to sepsis and require antibiotic treatment.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and treatment of her underlying medical conditions to prevent these potential complications and improve her overall outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and Ethanol (ETOH) cirrhosis who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a diagnosis of anion gap acidosis, hypoglycemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98Â°C, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress or asterixis. 

Laboratory results show an anion gap of 24 K/uL, with elevated lactate levels and a serum osmolality of 340 mOsm/kg. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The patient's blood counts are also abnormal, with thrombocytopenia and a platelet count of 28,000/Î¼L. 

The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is suspected to be due to gastritis and duodenitis, with a possible slow bleed due to hemorrhoids. The patient is receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and has been typed and crossed for 2u packed red blood cells (PRBCs). 

The patient's Ethanol level is 145, and she is suspected to have developed alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis. The patient is receiving thiamine and dextrose therapy to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy and to treat her hypoglycemia. 

The patient's cocaine use is suspected, given the presence of cocaine in her toxicology screen. The patient is being monitored on telemetry and is not receiving aspirin due to thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient's nutritional status is poor, with a history of poor oral intake and a recent admission for malnutrition. The patient is receiving a banana bag with multivitamins, folate, and thiamine to improve her nutritional status. 

The patient's disposition is pending, and she is being considered for a Section 35 hold to address her substance abuse issues. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Worsening anion gap acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis is already elevated, and further worsening could lead to severe acidosis, which can cause cardiovascular instability and death.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is ongoing, and further bleeding could lead to hemodynamic instability and death.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is already abnormal, and further decline could lead to bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia is already treated, but further episodes could lead to severe hypoglycemia, which can cause seizures, coma, and death.
5. Ethanol withdrawal: The patient's Ethanol level is 145, and withdrawal could lead to seizures, hallucinations, and cardiovascular instability.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's nutritional status is poor, and further malnutrition could lead to weakness, fatigue, and decreased immune function.
7. Infection: The patient's compromised immune function and malnutrition make her susceptible to infection, which could lead to sepsis and death.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with Hep C & ETOH cirrhosis with resolved BRBPR, stable Hct,
   no gap, in mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawl.
   # BRBPR: Pt underwent EGD in [**1-2**] that revealed gastritis &
   duodenitis, colonoscopy in [**10-3**] was normal.  Hct has been stable with
   IVF and HD stable.  Suspect that may be a slow bleed due to gastritis
   or possible hemorrhoids (seen on recent colonoscopy).  No frank melena
   on exam to suggest brisk upper GI bleed.  INR improved with Vit K
   administration. GI decided not to scope the patient. Transfuse Hct<21.
   - IV Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - transfused PRBC and platlets
   - do [**Hospital1 **] Hct, transfer back to unit for central line if BRBPR
   - given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed, will trend plts
   - admin Vitamin K 10mg po x 3 days
   - PIV x 2, 20g
   .
   # mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawl: Pt with poor nutrition status and long
   history of ETOH abuse. She denies h/o withdrawal and denies EtOH use
   within past 2-3 weeks, but current ETOH level of 145.  Will place on
   CIWA scale for now.  - CIWA scale
   - Ativan 1mg q2hr prn CIWA >10
   - Banana bag with MVI, folate, thiamine IV for two more days since not
   tolerating PO
   - Patient was seen by social work and refused detox last admission.
   Patient on previous admission was abusing while in the hospital.
   Section 35 was again discussed, but decided against the facilities that
   are part of Section 35 and will attempt to convince patient to get
   voluntary commitment
   - called psych so aware for possible section 35
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: resolved, Appears to have been caused by lactate,
   EtOH, and ketonemia from starvation. Given h/o poor po intake, ETOH
   abuse and cirrhosis, suspect this is due to alcoholic/starvation
   ketoacidosis. Lactate was elevated at 4.4, ETOH level was 145 with
   serum osms 340, urine ketones positive.  - received thiamine 100mg IV
   followed by dextrose for low BS. Lactate improved after hydration.
   - continuing to receive banana bag and D5 1/2NS
   .
   # Cocaine Abuse: Pt with long history of substance abuse and tox screen
   + for cocaine.  Pt has a h/o NSTEMI in setting of cocaine abuse. Pt
   currently denying CP, EKGs unchanged from prior.
   - cardiac enzymes negative
   - monitor on telemetry
   - no aspirin given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed
   - SW consult in am
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely due ETOH abuse, essentially at baseline.
   However, given GI bleed, would consider plt transfusion if dropping hct
   or plt count. Transfuse for <20k
   - transfuse 1u plts prn
   - f/u plt count

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with Hep C & ETOH cirrhosis with resolved BRBPR, stable Hct,
   no gap, in mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawl.
   # BRBPR: Pt underwent EGD in [**1-2**] that revealed gastritis &
   duodenitis, colonoscopy in [**10-3**] was normal.  Hct has been stable with
   IVF and HD stable.  Suspect that may be a slow bleed due to gastritis
   or possible hemorrhoids (seen on recent colonoscopy).  No frank melena
   on exam to suggest brisk upper GI bleed.  INR improved with Vit K
   administration. GI decided not to scope the patient. Transfuse Hct<21.
   - IV Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - transfused PRBC and platlets
   - do [**Hospital1 **] Hct, transfer back to unit for central line if BRBPR
   - given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed, will trend plts
   - admin Vitamin K 10mg po x 3 days
   - PIV x 2, 20g
   .
   # mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawl: Pt with poor nutrition status and long
   history of ETOH abuse. She denies h/o withdrawal and denies EtOH use
   within past 2-3 weeks, but current ETOH level of 145.  Will place on
   CIWA scale for now.  - CIWA scale
   - Ativan 1mg q2hr prn CIWA >10
   - Banana bag with MVI, folate, thiamine IV for two more days since not
   tolerating PO
   - Patient was seen by social work and refused detox last admission.
   Patient on previous admission was abusing while in the hospital.
   Section 35 was again discussed, but decided against the facilities that
   are part of Section 35 and will attempt to convince patient to get
   voluntary commitment
   - called psych so aware for possible section 35
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: resolved, Appears to have been caused by lactate,
   EtOH, and ketonemia from starvation. Given h/o poor po intake, ETOH
   abuse and cirrhosis, suspect this is due to alcoholic/starvation
   ketoacidosis. Lactate was elevated at 4.4, ETOH level was 145 with
   serum osms 340, urine ketones positive.  - received thiamine 100mg IV
   followed by dextrose for low BS. Lactate improved after hydration.
   - continuing to receive banana bag and D5 1/2NS
   .
   # Cocaine Abuse: Pt with long history of substance abuse and tox screen
   + for cocaine.  Pt has a h/o NSTEMI in setting of cocaine abuse. Pt
   currently denying CP, EKGs unchanged from prior.
   - cardiac enzymes negative
   - monitor on telemetry
   - no aspirin given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed
   - SW consult in am
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely due ETOH abuse, essentially at baseline.
   However, given GI bleed, would consider plt transfusion if dropping hct
   or plt count. Transfuse for <20k
   - transfuse 1u plts prn

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with Hepatitis C and EtOH cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for a gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has a history of EtOH abuse and has been experiencing symptoms of mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawal.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, and blood pressure of 128/72 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 24.2 g/dL, platelet count of 28 K/uL, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.4. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 90 IU/L and an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level of 133 IU/L.

The patient's medical history is significant for a history of NSTEMI in the setting of cocaine abuse. The patient's EKGs are unchanged from prior, and cardiac enzymes are negative.

The patient's current medications include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), antiplatelet agents, and antibiotics.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function is abnormal, which may increase the risk of encephalopathy.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may increase the risk of renal failure.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's albumin level is low, which may indicate malnutrition.
6. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may increase the risk of electrolyte imbalance.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of NSTEMI and cocaine abuse may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Transfusion of packed red blood cells and platelets as needed.
2. Administration of PPIs to reduce the risk of bleeding.
3. Antibiotic therapy to treat any underlying infections.
4. Electrolyte repletion to correct any electrolyte imbalances.
5. Monitoring of the patient's liver function and platelet count.
6. Monitoring of the patient's cardiovascular status.
7. Consideration of thrombocytopenia and GI bleed, will trend plts."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with Hep C & ETOH cirrhosis with resolved BRBPR, stable Hct,
   no gap, in mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawl.
   # BRBPR: Pt underwent EGD in [**1-2**] that revealed gastritis &
   duodenitis, colonoscopy in [**10-3**] was normal.  Hct has been stable with
   IVF and HD stable.  Suspect that may be a slow bleed due to gastritis
   or possible hemorrhoids (seen on recent colonoscopy).  No frank melena
   on exam to suggest brisk upper GI bleed.  INR improved with Vit K
   administration. GI decided not to scope the patient. Transfuse Hct<21.
   - IV Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - transfused PRBC and platlets
   - do [**Hospital1 **] Hct, transfer back to unit for central line if BRBPR
   - given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed, will trend plts
   - admin Vitamin K 10mg po x 3 days
   - PIV x 2, 20g
   .
   # mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawl: Pt with poor nutrition status and long
   history of ETOH abuse. She denies h/o withdrawal and denies EtOH use
   within past 2-3 weeks, but current ETOH level of 145.  Will place on
   CIWA scale for now.  - CIWA scale
   - Ativan 1mg q2hr prn CIWA >10
   - Banana bag with MVI, folate, thiamine IV for two more days since not
   tolerating PO
   - Patient was seen by social work and refused detox last admission.
   Patient on previous admission was abusing while in the hospital.
   Section 35 was again discussed, but decided against the facilities that
   are part of Section 35 and will attempt to convince patient to get
   voluntary commitment
   - called psych so aware for possible section 35
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: resolved, Appears to have been caused by lactate,
   EtOH, and ketonemia from starvation. Given h/o poor po intake, ETOH
   abuse and cirrhosis, suspect this is due to alcoholic/starvation
   ketoacidosis. Lactate was elevated at 4.4, ETOH level was 145 with
   serum osms 340, urine ketones positive.  - received thiamine 100mg IV
   followed by dextrose for low BS. Lactate improved after hydration.
   - continuing to receive banana bag and D5 1/2NS
   .
   # Cocaine Abuse: Pt with long history of substance abuse and tox screen
   + for cocaine.  Pt has a h/o NSTEMI in setting of cocaine abuse. Pt
   currently denying CP, EKGs unchanged from prior.
   - cardiac enzymes negative
   - monitor on telemetry
   - no aspirin given thrombocytopenia and GI bleed
   - SW consult in am
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely due ETOH abuse, essentially at baseline.
   However, given GI bleed, would consider plt transfusion if dropping hct
   or plt count. Transfuse for <20k
   - transfuse 1u plts prn
   - f/u plt count
   .
   # Hypoglycemia: resolved, Pt reports poor po intake, concern for
   alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis given elevated gap and low BS.
   # FEN: Regular diet
   - s/p Thiamine 100mg IV, banana bag and D5 1/2NS
   - aggressive electrolyte repletion
   .
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, PPI, bowel regimen
   .
   # Access: PIV x 2, maybe one 20g, will readmit to unit if BRBPR for
   central line placement

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with Hepatitis C and ethanol cirrhosis, who presented with a bleeding risk due to gastritis and duodenitis. She was admitted to the ICU with a bleeding risk and was treated with IV fluids and platelet transfusions. Her INR improved with Vitamin K administration. She developed mild EtOH/cocaine withdrawal symptoms, including hypertension, anxiety, tachycardia, and tactile hallucinations, and was treated with IV diazepam. Her anion gap acidosis was resolved with hydration and thiamine administration. She has a history of substance abuse and was found to have cocaine in her toxicology screen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding risk: The patient has a bleeding risk due to gastritis and duodenitis, and may require further transfusions if her hemoglobin drops below 21.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may increase her risk of bleeding and may require further transfusions.
3. EtOH/cocaine withdrawal: The patient is at risk for withdrawal symptoms, including hypertension, anxiety, tachycardia, and tactile hallucinations, and may require further treatment with benzodiazepines or other medications.
4. Anion gap acidosis: The patient's anion gap acidosis was resolved with hydration and thiamine administration, but may recur if she is unable to tolerate oral intake or if her liver function worsens.
5. Hepatitis C: The patient has Hepatitis C, which may worsen her liver function and increase her risk of bleeding and other complications.
6. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis may worsen her bleeding risk and increase her risk of complications, including ascites, encephalopathy, and sepsis.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor nutritional status may increase her risk of complications, including malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances, and infections.
8. Infection: The patient's history of substance abuse and her current medical condition may increase her risk of infection, including sepsis and pneumonia.
9. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of NSTEMI and her current cardiac enzymes may indicate a risk of cardiovascular complications, including myocardial infarction and cardiac arrhythmias."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can arise:

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, myocardial infarction, and alcohol poisoning. They have been admitted to the ICU and have received multiple blood transfusions, IV antibiotics, and other medications. The patient has developed altered mental status, hypoglycemia, and hypertension, and has been experiencing tactile hallucinations consistent with cocaine/ethanol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding complications: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and ongoing bleeding episodes increase the risk of bleeding complications, such as hemorrhagic shock, coagulopathy, and gastrointestinal perforation.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's history of hypoglycemia and the presence of hypoglycemic medications increase the risk of further hypoglycemic episodes, which can lead to seizures, coma, and even death.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of myocardial infarction and ongoing cardiac instability increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac arrest.
4. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and history of cocaine/ethanol withdrawal increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, and cognitive impairment.
5. Infection: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and ongoing antibiotic use increase the risk of infection, such as sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections.
6. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is unstable, and the risk of fluid overload is high, which can lead to cardiac failure, respiratory failure, and electrolyte imbalances.
7. Medication interactions: The patient is receiving multiple medications, and the risk of medication interactions is high, which can lead to adverse effects, such as bleeding, hypotension, and respiratory depression.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for multiple medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 63-inch tall individual with a 24-hour history of altered mental status, gastrointestinal bleed, hypoglycemia, and myocardial infarction. They have been treated for cocaine/EtOH withdrawal and have been experiencing nausea, hypertension, anxiety, and tactile hallucinations. The patient has been transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells and platelets, and has received IV diazepam for anxiety. They have also been given zofran for nausea and have had their medications switched to IV.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, blood pressure of 128/72 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute. Their oxygen saturation is 100% and their heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.1, hemoglobin of 24.2 g/dL, platelet count of 28,000/Î¼L, and creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL. Their troponin-T level is 0.10 ng/mL, and their lactate level is 3.2 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and fever could be indicative of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention.
2. GI bleed: The patient's GI bleed could worsen, leading to hemorrhagic shock and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia could worsen, leading to seizures, coma, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Myocardial infarction: The patient's myocardial infarction could worsen, leading to heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Poisoning: The patient's poisoning from cocaine/EtOH withdrawal could worsen, leading to seizures, coma, and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Infection: The patient's infection could spread, leading to sepsis, organ failure, and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient's bleeding complications could worsen, leading to hemorrhagic shock and potentially life-threatening complications.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension could worsen, leading to cardiac complications, stroke, and potentially life-threatening complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and respond promptly to any changes or complications that arise."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 y/o F with Hep C & ETOH cirrhosis who presented with 1 day of BRBPR
   and was found to have elevated anion gap, glucose 55 and ETOH level
   145.
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Multiple possible etiologies for elevated gap.
   Lactate elevated at 4.4, ETOH level 145 with serum osms of 340, urine
   ketones positive.  Given h/o poor po intake, ETOH abuse and cirrhosis,
   suspect this is due to alcoholic/starvation ketoacidosis.  Lactate
   improving after hydration.
   - received thiamine 100mg IV followed by dextrose for low BS
   - received banana bag followed by D5 1/2NS
   - continue D5 1/2NS until nutritional status improves
   - trend lactate and ABGs
   - monitor MS
   .
   # BRBPR: Pt underwent EGD in [**1-2**] that revealed gastritis &
   duodenitis, colonoscopy in [**10-3**] was normal.  Hct has been stable with
   IVF and HD stable.  Suspect that may be a slow bleed due to gastritis
   or possible hemorrhoids (seen on recent colonoscopy).  No frank melena
   on exam to suggest brisk upper GI bleed.  INR elevated at 2.1 on
   presentation in setting of GI bleed.  HCT mostly stable, unlikely to be
   significant bleed.
   - GI with no plan to scope
   - IV Protonix 40mg IV BID
   - typed and crossed for 2u prbcs
   - trend hct q6hrs, transfuse if acute hct drop or hct<21 (tx 1U PRBC on

   # ETOH level/withdrawl: Pt with poor nutrition status and long history
   of ETOH abuse. She denies h/o withdrawal and denies EtOH use within
   past 2-3 weeks, but current ETOH level of 145.  Will place on CIWA
   scale for now.  Required total of 4mg IV Ativan [**3-8**] PM.
   - CIWA scale
   - Ativan 1mg q2hr prn CIWA >10
   - Banana bag with MVI, folate, thiamine
   - Patient was seen by social work and refused detox last admission.
   Patient on previous admission was abusing while in the hospital.
   Section 35 was again discussed, but decided against the facilities that
   are part of Section 35 and will attempt to convince patient to get

   + for cocaine.  Pt has a h/o NSTEMI in setting of cocaine abuse. Pt
   currently denying CP, EKGs unchanged from prior.
   - cardiac enzymes negative

   -  D5 1/2NS IVF until eating
   - hold on insulin regimen
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely due ETOH abuse, essentially at baseline.
   However, given GI bleed, would consider plt transfusion if dropping hct

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   24 Hour Events:
   [**3-9**] Events:
   - patient has two 18 gauge for IV access
   - social work consult placed
   - spoke to GI and said that they would scope if bleeds again, patient
   did bleed again (marroon liquid gross blood in stool)
   - patient was transfused 1u PRBC and platlets
   - Hct stable, INR improved did not give Vitamin K
   - patient became nauseous and was given zofran and meds switched to IV
   - in the evening the patient became hypertensive, anxious,
   tachycardiac, and developed tactile hallucinations consistent with
   cocaine/EtOH withdrawl and patient was placed on CIWA scale with IV

The patient is a 62-year-old female with Hepatitis C and ethanol cirrhosis who was admitted with 1 day of coffee ground emesis and was found to have elevated anion gap, glucose 55, and ethanol level 145. She has a history of poor nutrition status, ethanol abuse, and cirrhosis. The patient has been experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding, which has been managed with transfusions and proton pump inhibitors. She has also been experiencing ethanol withdrawal symptoms, which have been managed with benzodiazepines. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia, and an elevated INR.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may continue to pose a risk of hemorrhage and bleeding complications.
2. Ethanol withdrawal syndrome: The patient's ethanol withdrawal syndrome may worsen if not properly managed, leading to seizures, hallucinations, and other complications.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia may continue to pose a risk of neurological damage and death if not properly managed.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia may worsen if not properly managed, leading to bleeding complications.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis and ethanol abuse may increase her risk of developing hepatic encephalopathy, a life-threatening complication of liver disease.
6. Sepsis: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding and ethanol abuse may increase her risk of developing sepsis, a life-threatening complication of infection.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's ethanol abuse and respiratory acidosis may increase her risk of developing respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
8. Cardiac complications: The patient's ethanol abuse and cardiovascular disease may increase her risk of developing cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction and arrhythmias."
