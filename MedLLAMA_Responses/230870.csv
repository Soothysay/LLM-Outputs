You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   69 y/o F with hx of metastatic NSCLC, known RLE DVT, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia, dCHF and pulm HTN who was admitted [**2161-3-1**]  with 2 days
   of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and a RLE cellulitis.
   Now with bilateral PEs.
   .
   # PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  Recurrent thromboembolism on coumadin.  Most
   likely source of PE is known LLE DVT.  Now s/p placement of IVC
   filter.  Currently with supratherapeutic INR with heparin drip started
   overnight. She is hemodynamically stable and sating at baseline in high
   90s on 3L.
   - hold coumadin tonight with goal to be therapeutic 2.5-3
   - start IV heparin for now; consider transition to lovenox soon
   - continue nebulizers PNR
   - morphine PRN for pain control
   .
   # PNA: has PNA seen on the CT scan, does have a cough on exam today and
   has some sputum production.  Recently hospitalized, so should have HAP
   coverage, will add azithro for atypical coverage as well.
   - continue vanco, cefepime, azithro
   - legionella antigen
   - send sputum sample
   .
   # NSCLC: is metastatic, was due to start chemotherapy this Thursday but
   likely will have to defer now.  Has not had chemo or radiation in the
   past, just local resection.
   - s/p resection, but now with recurrence
   - no chemo currently
   - consider heme onc consult in the AM
   - hold dexamethasone taper for now as is for pre-chemo nausea tx

   # Diastolic CHF: appears euvolemic on exam; has mild peripheral edema,
   L > R, but likely from the DVT rather than fluid overload.  Is
   normotensive.
   - euvolemic on exam
   - hold lasix tonight, start as needed tomorrow
   .
   # SOB: likely from the factors above, will continue treatment for PE
   with double anticoagulation, abx for pneumonia and will consult heme
   onc for lung cancer management
   .
   # HTN: stable, normotensive

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), known right leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted with 2 days of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and a right leg cellulitis. She now has bilateral pulmonary embolism (PE) and has been placed on an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter.

The patient is currently on heparin drip and has a supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR). She is hemodynamically stable and has a baseline saturation of 90% on 3 liters of oxygen.

The patient has a cough and is producing sputum, and a computed tomography (CT) scan shows patchy opacity in the left upper lobe and left lung base, which may represent a new infectious process or developing pulmonary infarcts.

The patient is being treated for pulmonary embolism with double anticoagulation, antibiotics for pneumonia, and will be consulted with a hematology oncology specialist for lung cancer management.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hemoptysis: The patient is experiencing small amounts of hemoptysis, which may be a sign of pulmonary embolism or bleeding from the IVC filter.
2. Pulmonary Infarction: The patient has patchy opacity in the left upper lobe and left lung base, which may represent developing pulmonary infarcts.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 90% on 3 liters of oxygen, which may indicate respiratory failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient has a cough and is producing sputum, which may indicate a bacterial infection.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 287, which may indicate thrombocytopenia.
6. Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, which may indicate renal insufficiency.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may indicate an electrolyte imbalance.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which may need to be managed during her hospital stay.
9. Diastolic CHF: The patient has diastolic CHF, which may need to be managed during her hospital stay.
10. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, which may need to be managed during her hospital stay.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic NSCLC, known RLE DVT, HTN, hyperlipidemia, dCHF, and pulm HTN. She was admitted with 2 days of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and a RLE cellulitis. She developed bilateral PEs and was found to have nonocclusive thrombus in the left popliteal vein and occlusive thrombus in the right popliteal vein. She was started on heparin drip and an IVC filter was placed. She has been experiencing hemoptysis, and her INR is supratherapeutic. She is also diagnosed with PNA and has a cough, sputum production, and patchy opacity in the left upper lobe and left lung base.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has developed bilateral PEs, which can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and death if not treated promptly.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient's hemoptysis can worsen and lead to respiratory distress, bleeding, and infection.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of RLE DVT and has developed nonocclusive thrombus in the left popliteal vein, which can lead to pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, and post-thrombotic syndrome.
4. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has been diagnosed with PNA, which can lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and death if not treated promptly.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which can lead to hypothyroid crisis if not treated promptly.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, which can lead to cardiovascular disease, stroke, and death if not treated promptly.
7. Diastolic CHF: The patient has a history of diastolic CHF, which can lead to heart failure, cardiac arrest, and death if not treated promptly.
8. HTN: The patient has a history of HTN, which can lead to cardiovascular disease, stroke, and death if not treated promptly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin and IVC filter to prevent further thrombotic events.
2. Start antibiotic therapy for PNA and monitor for signs of sepsis.
3. Consult heme onc for lung cancer management and consider chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
4. Monitor for signs of hypothyroid crisis and adjust thyroid hormone replacement therapy as needed.
5. Monitor for signs of hyperlipidemia and adjust lipid-lowering therapy as needed.
6. Monitor for signs of diastolic CHF and adjust diuretic therapy as needed.
7. Monitor for signs of HTN and adjust antihypertensive therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 CALLED OUT
   - Oncology recs: Plan is to begin chemo this week; given comorbidities
   and (lack of) support, would go less aggressive. Most likely delay
   chemo until Friday or early next week. Continue folate > 350 mcg/day as
   pre-chemo tx. Agree with heparin -> Lovenox for new PE (though will
   need to f/u patient's resources for receiving Lovenox). Would accept to
   [**Hospital Ward Name 575**] OMED if bed opens. Prognosis is limited.
   - Dark urine with ? clots per nursing. Was supratherapeutic on heparin
   gtt earlier in the day.
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hct: 28 -> 30 (noon)
   - PM coags: INR 3.9, PTT 40.2; chem 10 WNL
   - Called out to OMED but no bed today

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), known right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted with two days of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and a right lower extremity cellulitis. She now has bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and has been placed on an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient is hemodynamically stable and saturating at baseline in the high 90s on 2 liters of oxygen.

The patient has developed hematuria, hemoptysis, and hematemesis, which seems to be improving. Her INR and PTT were supratherapeutic yesterday, but are now slightly sub-therapeutic. She is at risk for bleeding and may require transfusion for a hematocrit (Hct) < 25.

The patient's oncologist recommends starting chemotherapy, but it may need to be delayed due to her comorbidities and lack of support. She will require a PICC line for oncologic treatment and may need to be transitioned to Lovenox soon.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's INR and PTT were supratherapeutic yesterday, which increases her risk of bleeding. She may require transfusion for a hematocrit (Hct) < 25.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has bilateral PEs and is at risk for further embolism.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is 265, which is slightly low. She may be at risk for bleeding due to thrombocytopenia.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient is taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, but her thyroid function should be monitored closely.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has hyperlipidemia, which increases her risk of cardiovascular disease. She should continue taking a statin.
6. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has diastolic heart failure, which increases her risk of cardiac complications. She should be monitored closely for signs of worsening heart failure.
7. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, which increases her risk of cardiovascular disease. She should be monitored closely for signs of worsening hypertension.
8. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 9.0 g/dL, which is slightly low. She may be at risk for anemia.
9. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels should be monitored closely to prevent electrolyte imbalance.
10. Infection: The patient has a history of cellulitis and may be at risk for infection. She should be monitored closely for signs of infection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy with Lovenox to prevent further pulmonary embolism.
2. Monitor the patient's INR and PTT closely to prevent bleeding.
3. Transfuse the patient for a hematocrit (Hct) < 25.
4. Continue the patient's statin for hyperlipidemia.
5. Monitor the patient's thyroid function closely to prevent hypothyroidism.
6. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely to prevent hypertension.
7. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely to prevent electrolyte imbalance.
8. Monitor the patient's hemoglobin level closely to prevent anemia.
9. Monitor the patient for signs of infection and take appropriate action if infection is suspected.
10. Consider consulting with a nephrologist or cardiologist to manage the patient's diastolic heart failure and hypertension."

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o F with hx of metastatic NSCLC, known RLE DVT, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia, dCHF and pulm HTN who was admitted [**2161-3-1**]  with 2 days
   of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and a RLE cellulitis.
   Now with bilateral PEs.
   .
   # PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  Recurrent thromboembolism on coumadin.  Most
   likely source of PE is known LLE DVT.  Now s/p placement of IVC
   filter.  Currently with supratherapeutic INR with heparin drip
   re-started overnight. She is hemodynamically stable and sating at
   baseline in high 90s on 3L.
   - discontinue coumadin as this likely represents a failure of coumadin
   - hold IV heparin for now as supratherapeutic
 will restart heparin at
   low dose when ptt < 75; consider transition to lovenox soon (likely
   100mg SC BID)
 may need to follow factor X levels initially over
   concern for sensitivity to anticoagulants
   - continue nebulizers PNR
   - morphine PRN for pain control
   - may require PICC for oncologic treatment as well as difficulty with
   blood draws/access.
   .
   # PNA: has PNA seen on the CT scan, does have a cough on exam today and
   has some sputum production.  Recently hospitalized, so should have HAP
   coverage, will add azithro for atypical coverage as well.
   - discontinued vanco, cefepime, azithro; patient has remained afebrile
   - legionella antigen
   - send sputum sample
   .
   # NSCLC: is metastatic, was due to start chemotherapy this Thursday but
   likely will have to defer now.  Has not had chemo or radiation in the
   past, just local resection.
   - s/p resection, but now with recurrence
   - no chemo currently
   - consider heme onc consult in the AM
   - hold dexamethasone taper for now as is for pre-chemo nausea tx
   .
   # Diastolic CHF: appears euvolemic on exam; has mild peripheral edema,
   L > R, but likely from the DVT rather than fluid overload.  Is
   normotensive.
   - euvolemic on exam
   - hold lasix tonight, start as needed tomorrow
   .
   # SOB: likely from the factors above, will continue treatment for PE
   with double anticoagulation, abx for pneumonia and will consult heme
   onc for lung cancer management
   .
   # HTN: stable, normotensive
   - hold HTN meds in light of new diagnosis
   - meds being held are nifedipine, lisionpril, lasix (restart PRN for
   hypertension)
   - Patient has been successfully restarted on metoprolol; will add back
   lasix as blood pressure permits)
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hypothyroid:
   - continue levothyroxine

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o F with hx of metastatic NSCLC, known RLE DVT, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia, dCHF and pulm HTN who was admitted [**2161-3-1**]  with 2 days
   of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and a RLE cellulitis.
   Now with bilateral PEs.
   .
   # PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  Recurrent thromboembolism on coumadin.  Most
   likely source of PE is known LLE DVT.  Now s/p placement of IVC
   filter.  Currently with supratherapeutic INR with heparin drip
   re-started overnight. She is hemodynamically stable and sating at
   baseline in high 90s on 3L.
   - discontinue coumadin as this likely represents a failure of coumadin
   - hold IV heparin for now as supratherapeutic
 will restart heparin at
   low dose when ptt < 75; consider transition to lovenox soon (likely
   100mg SC BID)
 may need to follow factor X levels initially over
   concern for sensitivity to anticoagulants
   - continue nebulizers PNR
   - morphine PRN for pain control
   - may require PICC for oncologic treatment as well as difficulty with
   blood draws/access.
   .
   # PNA: has PNA seen on the CT scan, does have a cough on exam today and
   has some sputum production.  Recently hospitalized, so should have HAP
   coverage, will add azithro for atypical coverage as well.
   - discontinued vanco, cefepime, azithro; patient has remained afebrile
   - legionella antigen
   - send sputum sample
   .
   # NSCLC: is metastatic, was due to start chemotherapy this Thursday but
   likely will have to defer now.  Has not had chemo or radiation in the
   past, just local resection.
   - s/p resection, but now with recurrence
   - no chemo currently
   - consider heme onc consult in the AM
   - hold dexamethasone taper for now as is for pre-chemo nausea tx
   .
   # Diastolic CHF: appears euvolemic on exam; has mild peripheral edema,
   L > R, but likely from the DVT rather than fluid overload.  Is
   normotensive.
   - euvolemic on exam
   - hold lasix tonight, start as needed tomorrow
   .
   # SOB: likely from the factors above, will continue treatment for PE
   with double anticoagulation, abx for pneumonia and will consult heme
   onc for lung cancer management
   .
   # HTN: stable, normotensive
   - hold HTN meds in light of new diagnosis
   - meds being held are nifedipine, lisionpril, lasix (restart PRN for
   hypertension)
   - Patient has been successfully restarted on metoprolol; will add back
   lasix as blood pressure permits)

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), known right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diastolic heart failure. She was admitted with 2 days of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and a right lower extremity cellulitis. She now has bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs).

The patient is currently receiving supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) with heparin drip re-started overnight. She is hemodynamically stable and saturating at baseline in the high 90s on 3 liters of oxygen.

The patient has a number of potential medical complications that can arise, including:

1. Bleeding complications due to supratherapeutic INR and heparin therapy.
2. Pulmonary embolism recurrence due to inadequate anticoagulation.
3. Infection complications, including pneumonia and sepsis, due to bilateral PEs.
4. Cardiac complications, including heart failure and arrhythmias, due to underlying diastolic heart failure and potential for cardiac strain from bilateral PEs.
5. Respiratory complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure, due to bilateral PEs.
6. Neurological complications, including stroke and seizure, due to bilateral PEs.
7. Metastatic disease progression, including potential for further spread of NSCLC.
8. Chemotherapy-related complications, including nausea, vomiting, and neutropenia, if chemotherapy is initiated.

The patient's medications and treatments include:

1. Heparin drip for anticoagulation.
2. Lovenox for anticoagulation.
3. Cefepime and azithromycin for pneumonia coverage.
4. Vancomycin for coverage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
5. Morphine for pain control.
6. Nebulizers for bronchodilation.
7. Statin for hyperlipidemia.
8. Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.
9. Metoprolol for hypertension.
10. Lasix for diastolic heart failure.

The patient's laboratory results include:

1. Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 8.2, Hct 30.3, Plt 265.
2. Chemistry: Cr 0.8, TropT <0.01, Glucose 93.
3. Coagulation studies: PT 31.0, PTT 56.3, INR 3.9.
4. Electrolytes: Na 139, K 4.2, Cl 101, PO4 2.7.

The patient's imaging studies include:

1. CT scan: showing bilateral PEs and pulmonary nodules.

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

1. Tachypnea with bilateral PEs.
2. Mild peripheral edema.
3. Normotensive blood pressure.
4. Tachycardia with sinus rhythm.

The patient's clinical status is currently stable, but she is at risk for a number of potential complications. Further monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o F with hx of metastatic NSCLC, known RLE DVT, HTN,
   hyperlipidemia, dCHF and pulm HTN who was admitted [**2161-3-1**]  with 2 days
   of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and a RLE cellulitis.
   Now with bilateral PEs.
   .
   # PULMONARY EMBOLISM:  Recurrent thromboembolism on coumadin.  Most
   likely source of PE is known LLE DVT.  Now s/p placement of IVC
   filter.  Supratherapeutic INR yesterday, now slightly sub-therapeutic.
   She is hemodynamically stable and satting at baseline in high 90s on
   2L.
   - discontinue coumadin as this likely represents a failure of coumadin
   - continue IV heparin gtt; consider transition to lovenox soon (likely
   100mg SC BID)
 may need to follow factor X levels initially over
   concern for sensitivity to anticoagulants
   - continue nebulizers PRN
   - morphine PRN for pain control
   - may require PICC for oncologic treatment as well as difficulty with
   blood draws/access.
   .
   # PNA: PNA seen on the CT scan, but not impressive; patient afebrile.
   Discontinued vanco, cefepime, azithro on [**3-2**]; patient has remained
   afebrile since with Tmax 99.6 on night of [**3-2**] at MN.
   - legionella antigen, sputum sample : not yet ordered
   .
   # NSCLC: is metastatic, was due to start chemotherapy this Thursday but
   likely will have to defer now.  Has not had chemo or radiation in the
   past, just local resection.
   - no chemo currently; Onc recs: most likely will start less aggressive
   chemo Friday or early next week
   - continue folate
   - SW consult?
   - hold dexamethasone taper for now as is for pre-chemo nausea tx
   .
   # Diastolic CHF: appears euvolemic on exam; has mild peripheral edema,
   but likely from the DVT rather than fluid overload.  Is normotensive.
   - euvolemic on exam
   - hold lasix for now, start as needed
   .
   # SOB: likely from the factors above, will continue treatment for PE
   with double anticoagulation; onc following for lung ca
   .
   # HTN: stable, normotensive
   - hold HTN meds in light of new diagnosis
   - meds being held are nifedipine, lisionpril, lasix (restart PRN for
   hypertension)
   - Patient has been successfully restarted on metoprolol; will add back
   lasix as blood pressure permits
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin
   .
   # Hypothyroid:
   - continue levothyroxine
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: heparin gtt, PPI

Summary:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), known right lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and pulmonary hypertension. She was admitted with 2 days of pleuritic chest pain after being off coumadin and a right lower extremity cellulitis. She now has bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs). The patient has been hemodynamically stable and is saturating at baseline in the high 90s on 2L oxygen.

The patient's medical history includes metastatic NSCLC, known RLE DVT, HTN, hyperlipidemia, dCHF, and pulm HTN. She was due to start chemotherapy this Thursday but will likely need to defer due to her current condition.

The patient's current medications include IV heparin, pantoprazole, and folate. She is receiving nebulizers PRN and morphine PRN for pain control. The patient has been afebrile since discontinuing vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent thromboembolism: The patient has a known RLE DVT and is now experiencing bilateral PEs, which may require further anticoagulation and monitoring.
2. Anticoagulation sensitivity: The patient's supratherapeutic INR yesterday and sub-therapeutic INR today may indicate sensitivity to anticoagulants, which may require closer monitoring and adjustments to anticoagulation therapy.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's bilateral PEs may require further treatment and monitoring to prevent further complications.
4. Chemo-related complications: The patient's planned chemotherapy may need to be delayed or modified due to her current condition, which may increase the risk of chemo-related complications.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's history of hypothyroidism may require further monitoring and adjustments to her thyroid medication.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's history of hyperlipidemia may require further monitoring and adjustments to her statin medication.
7. Diastolic CHF: The patient's history of diastolic CHF may require further monitoring and adjustments to her medication regimen.
8. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension may require further monitoring and adjustments to her medication regimen.

Recommendations:

1. Continue IV heparin and consider transitioning to Lovenox soon.
2. Monitor the patient's INR and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
3. Continue nebulizers PRN and morphine PRN for pain control.
4. Consider a SW consult to discuss the patient's lung cancer treatment options.
5. Hold dexamethasone taper for now and restart as needed for pre-chemo nausea tx.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolytes and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
7. Continue statin medication for hyperlipidemia.
8. Continue levothyroxine medication for hypothyroidism.
9. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.
10. Consider a PICC line for oncologic treatment and difficulty with blood draws/access."
