   lung collapse and effusion
   Assessment and Plan
   46M with DMI and metastatic NSCLC admitted with AMS, found to have DKA
   .
   #. Altered mental status:  Likely related to DKA as hyperosmolar state
   will cause contraction of neurons. Also concern for metastatic disease
   to brain. Unable to do full neuro exam given mental status changes.
   Infection also possibility.
   - Treat DKA as below
   - Continue to assess mental status
   .
   #. Diabetic ketoacidosis:  Hyperglycemia, acidosis, large anion gap,
   and ketonuria. Patient also with large osmolar gap. Preceded by not
   taking insulin x3 days. With partial respiratory compensation.
   - Hydrate patient aggressively. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 294**] protocol, initially with NS,
   then 1/2NS, then D5 1/2NS when glucose<250.
   - Insulin gtt. Once blood glucose <250, will start D5 1/2 NS. Once gap
   closed and patient is able to tolerate POs, will bridge to subcutaneous
   insulin.
   - Q1 hour blood glucose monitoring
   - Notify [**Last Name (un) 294**]
   - Aggressive electrolyte monitoring, particularly potassium (below),
   sodium
   - Antiemetics
   .
   #. Coffee-ground emesis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be related retching ([**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear).
   Also possibility for ulceration given chemotherapy, radiation therapy.
   - GI consult
   - Type and screen
   - Repeat hematocrit Q6 hours until stable
   - PPI IV
   .
   #. Hyperkalemia:  Serum potassium elevated on admission although likely
   total body potassium depleted given hyperglycemic diuresis. Acidosis
   causes extracellular shift of potassium. Acute renal failure also
   likely a contributor. EKG with peaked T waves in ED. Expect potassium
   to come down with correction of hyperglycemia.
   - Careful monitoring of electrolytes (Q2 hours)
   - Aggressive potassium repletion (with recognition of renal failure)
   once glucose begins to normalize secondary to intracellular shift and
   overall total body potassium depletion
   .
   #. Hyperosmolar gap:  Larger than expected with DKA, although possible
   given that measured Na is underestimated in setting of such high
   hyperglycemia. No known toxin intoxication.
   - Send off screen for ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol
   - Recheck serum osm once hyperglycemia improves
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Baseline creatinine 0.8. Currently creatinine
   1.9. Given large volume diuresis associated with DKA, most likely
   prerenal etiology. ATN also possibility. ?renal toxicity from recently
   started chemotherapeutic agents.
   - Continue hydration, as above
   - Urine lytes
   .
   #. Right pleural effusion:  Known malignant pleural effusion. Will
   watch for indication of post-obstructive pneumonia. Afebrile and
   without leukocytosis, although does have left-shift.
   .
   #. NSLC:  s/p XRT. Cycle 1 of gemcitibane, carboplatin started [**2176-8-6**].
   - Notify oncologist of admission
   - Continue morphine SR per outpatient regimen, with hold parameters
   .
   #. Bipolar disorder:
   - Continue Depakote, quietiapine, and venlafaxine per home regimen
   .
   #. Hypertension:  Not on medication therapy.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia:  Not on medication therapy.
   .
   FEN:  Liquid diet given nausea, advance as tolerated; aggressive fluid
   resuscitation, as above
   Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots and heparin SC TID (double coverage given
   malignancy), PPI per home regimen, bowel regimen standing and as needed
   Access:  PIV, right femoral CVL (will need to replace given infection
   risk)
   Code:  FULL CODE, presumed - need to further discuss with wife and
   patient when his mental status improves

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the information as follows:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and a recent admission for altered mental status (AMS) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient was found to have a large anion gap and ketonuria, and was treated with insulin drip and IV fluids.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 38.1°C, Tcurrent 37°C, HR 90 bpm, BP 114/78 mmHg, RR 20 inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is being closely monitored for signs of shock or hypotension.
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 4,475 mL of IV fluids, with a balance of 1,525 mL.
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving invasive ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and a PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
* Laboratory results: The patient's blood glucose level is 837 mg/dL, and his serum potassium level is 44 mg/dL. His creatinine level is 1.9 mg/dL, and his BUN level is 27 mg/dL.
* Imaging studies: The patient's chest X-ray (CXR) shows an endotracheal tube approximately 6 cm above the carina, mild right tracheal deviation, right lung collapse, and right pleural effusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hyperkalemia: The patient's serum potassium level is elevated, and may continue to rise due to the hyperglycemic state and acidosis.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 1.9 mg/dL, and may continue to rise due to the large volume diuresis associated with DKA and the possible prerenal etiology.
3. Right pleural effusion: The patient has a known malignant pleural effusion, and may develop post-obstructive pneumonia if the effusion is not properly managed.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of a central venous catheter.
5. DKA: The patient's hyperglycemic state may continue to worsen if not properly managed with insulin and IV fluids.
6. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's acidosis may continue to worsen if not properly managed with IV fluids and insulin.
7. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may continue to worsen if not properly managed with IV fluids and vasopressors.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may continue to worsen if not properly managed with invasive ventilation and oxygen therapy.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, I recommend the following:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Continue to manage the patient's hyperglycemic state with insulin and IV fluids.
3. Continue to manage the patient's acidosis with IV fluids and insulin.
4. Continue to manage the patient's right pleural effusion with drainage and chemotherapy.
5. Continue to monitor the patient for signs of infection and take appropriate measures to prevent and treat infection.
6. Continue to manage the patient's respiratory failure with invasive ventilation and oxygen therapy.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and take appropriate measures to prevent and treat acute renal failure.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's potassium level and take appropriate measures to prevent and treat hyperkalemia.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat potential complications."

   potassium depleted given hyperglycemic diuresis and intracellular shift
   now that acidosis is correcting.
   - Careful monitoring of electrolytes (Q6 hours)
   - Aggressive potassium repletion with goal K>4.5
   .
   #. Hypernatremia:  In setting of hyperosmolar gap on admission with
   free water deficit.  Will calculate free water deficit and replace with
   D5W (separate from the 1/2NS with KCl).
   # Hyperosmolar gap: Likely secondary to DKA as gap closed with anion
   gap closing and no calcium oxalate crystals seen on urine exam.
   Continuing to empirically treat for possible ethylene glycol intox with
   fomepizole until serum level comes back as negative.
   - f/u  methanol (alcohol profile), ethylene glycol

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 46-year-old male admitted with altered mental status, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was started on insulin drip, IV fluids, and fomepizole for possible ethylene glycol intoxication. His anion and osmolar gap has closed, and he is now receiving D5 1/2NS with KCl and insulin drip. He has hypokalemia, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure, which is improving. He also has a known malignant pleural effusion and is on chemotherapy. His mental status is altered, and he is intubated and sedated.

Potential medical complications:

1. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and fever may indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be investigated and treated promptly.
2. Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome: The patient's hyperglycemia and hyperosmolar gap may lead to further complications such as seizures, cerebral edema, or even death if not managed properly.
3. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's acute renal failure may be caused by ATN, which can lead to chronic kidney disease or even end-stage renal disease if not managed properly.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient's hypokalemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or even cardiac arrest if not managed properly.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to central pontine myelinolysis, which can cause severe neurological deficits or even death if not managed properly.
6. Right pleural effusion: The patient's known malignant pleural effusion may lead to respiratory compromise or even respiratory failure if not managed properly.
7. Metastatic disease: The patient's metastatic NSCLC may lead to further complications such as spinal cord compression, brain metastases, or other systemic complications if not managed properly.
8. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's coffee-ground emesis may indicate a gastrointestinal bleed, which needs to be investigated and treated promptly.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and acute renal failure. He also needs to be assessed for underlying infections, and his right pleural effusion needs to be monitored for signs of respiratory compromise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and intubated for airway protection due to coffee ground emesis. He has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and lung cancer. The patient's current condition includes:

* Hypernatremia (Na 164 mmol/L) due to hyperosmolar diuresis
* DKA, likely secondary to 3 days of non-compliance with insulin therapy
* Altered mental status, possibly contributed to by hypernatremia and recent hyperosmolar state
* Intubation for airway protection due to altered mental status and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB)
* Respiratory failure, with improved oxygenation on mechanical ventilation
* Acute kidney injury (ARF), now improved with volume repletion
* Presence of a large right pleural effusion

Potential medical complications:

1. Further deterioration of mental status due to electrolyte imbalances
2. Development of fever, which may require lumbar puncture (LP) to rule out encephalitis
3. Delayed wound healing due to malnutrition and poor glycemic control
4. Increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)
5. Potential for further fluid overload and worsening of ARF
6. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of UGIB, which may lead to further complications, such as bleeding or perforation
7. Potential for further electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia, due to ongoing diuresis and insulin therapy
8. Increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and presence of central lines."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with Stage IV NSCLC, intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cancer. He is currently receiving insulin and D5 infusions, as well as other medications to manage his condition. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 100.5°F, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 155/93 mmHg. He has a closed osmolar gap and anion gap, indicating resolution of his hyperosmolar state.

Potential medical complications:

1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be contributing to his delirium, which is likely related to hypernatremia and recent hyperosmolar state.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium level is elevated, which may lead to complications such as seizures, coma, or even death if left untreated.
3. DKA: The patient's DKA is likely related to non-compliance with medication and may recur if not properly managed.
4. UGIB: The patient's UGIB is unclear, but may be related to a Mallory-Weiss tear or other gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
6. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's altered mental status and UGIB may increase his risk of developing AKI.
7. Infection: The patient's fever and altered mental status may indicate an underlying infection, which may worsen his condition if left untreated.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to ensure resolution of his hyperosmolar state and DKA.
2. Manage the patient's delirium with medications such as fentanyl and re-assess when his electrolytes improve.
3. Replace the patient's free water deficit with D5 infusions to manage his hypernatremia.
4. Continue to manage the patient's UGIB with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and monitor for signs of bleeding.
5. Continue to provide respiratory support with mechanical ventilation and monitor for signs of respiratory failure.
6. Monitor the patient's kidney function and consider dialysis if necessary.
7. Consider imaging studies such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule out other underlying conditions."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

* Temperature: 38.1°C (100.5°F)
* Heart rate: 81 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 155/93 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Blood glucose: 837 mg/dL
* Serum osmolality: 28 mmol/L
* Serum potassium: 27 mEq/L
* Serum calcium: 8.1 mg/dL
* Serum magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL
* Serum phosphorus: 1.6 mg/dL
* White blood cell count: 9.2 x 10^9/L
* Hematocrit: 27.5%
* Platelet count: 358 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.9 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 2.6 mmol/L

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
* Hypernatremia
* Respiratory failure
* Acute kidney injury (ARF)
* Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB)
* Delirium

The patient's treatment plan includes:

* Insulin infusion to control blood glucose levels
* Fomepizole to treat ethylene glycol poisoning
* PPI to prevent stress ulcers
* Prophylactic antibiotics for pneumonia
* DVT prophylaxis with pneumatic compression boots
* VAP bundle to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further deterioration of the patient's respiratory status
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Increased risk of bleeding due to coagulopathy
* Development of electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
* Increased risk of pneumonia or other infections due to prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Development of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease due to prolonged use of nephrotoxic medications or inadequate fluid management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with Stage IV NSCLC, admitted with DKA, intubated for airway protection due to coffee ground emesis. The patient has a history of R pleural effusion and is at risk for UGIB. The patient's delirium is likely contributed by hypernatremia and recent hyperosmolar state. The patient's hypernatremia is secondary to hyperosmolar diuresis, and the calculated free water gap is being replaced with D5.

Medical Complications:

1. DKA: The patient has a history of non-compliance with medication, which likely contributed to the development of DKA. The patient's AG is now closed, and he is being continued on insulin gtt. The plan is to transition to oral insulin and discontinue mechanical ventilation when able.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia is secondary to hyperosmolar diuresis, and the calculated free water gap is being replaced with D5.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status and UGIB.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is now improved with volume repletion.
5. UGIB: The patient's UGIB is unclear given negative gastro-occult tests, but is likely due to a Mallory-Weiss tear.
6. Fever: The patient has a fever of 100.5, possibly related to acute DKA.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust insulin gtt as needed.
2. Transition the patient to oral insulin and discontinue mechanical ventilation when able.
3. Continue to replace the patient's free water gap with D5.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust ventilation settings as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust fluid management accordingly.
6. Consider obtaining a LP to rule out encephalitis if the patient develops a fever above 101°F.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust sedation and analgesia as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a right pleural effusion, who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He was intubated for airway protection due to altered mental status and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has a history of type I diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cancer. His current condition is complicated by hypernatremia, likely due to hyperosmolar diuresis, and delirium, which may be related to hypernatremia and recent hyperosmolar state.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and poor oral care.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and increased risk of thrombosis.
4. Stress ulcer bleeding due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and altered mental status.
5. Encephalitis or meningitis due to fever and altered mental status, which may require lumbar puncture (LP) for diagnosis.
6. Worsening of hypernatremia and hyperosmolar state, leading to further complications such as seizures, coma, or death.
7. Delayed wound healing and increased risk of infection due to prolonged immobility and altered mental status.
8. Potential for further gastrointestinal bleeding due to underlying UGIB and altered mental status.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust insulin therapy as needed to prevent further complications.
2. Consider LP if the patient develops a fever above 101°F (38.3°C) to rule out encephalitis or meningitis.
3. Implement stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis measures as per hospital protocol.
4. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider extubation when feasible.
5. Consider transitioning to enteral nutrition when the patient is able to tolerate it.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and adjust sedation therapy as needed to prevent further complications."

   46M with DMI and metastatic NSCLC admitted with AMS, found to have DKA
   .
   #. Altered mental status:  Likely related to DKA as hyperosmolar state
   can cause contraction of neurons. Also concern for metastatic disease
   to brain. Unable to do full neuro exam given mental status changes.
   Infection also possibility.
   - Treat DKA as below
   - Continue to assess mental status with sedation weaning
   - Consider LP if worsening fever and no improvement
   .
   #. Diabetic ketoacidosis:  Anion and osmolar gap now closed.  Receiving
   D5 1/2NS with KCl at 250cc/hr and still on insulin drip.
   - Once patient is able to tolerate POs, will bridge to subcutaneous
   insulin.
   - Q4 hour blood glucose monitoring
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following
   - Aggressive electrolyte monitoring, particularly potassium (below),
   sodium
   - Antiemetics
   .
   #. Hypokalemia:  Serum potassium now low reflecting low total body
   potassium depleted given hyperglycemic diuresis and intracellular shift
   now that acidosis is correcting.
   - Careful monitoring of electrolytes (Q6 hours)
   - Aggressive potassium repletion with goal K>4.5
   .
   #. Hypernatremia:  In setting of hyperosmolar gap on admission with
   free water deficit.  Will calculate free water deficit and replace with
   D5W (separate from the 1/2NS with KCl).
   # Hyperosmolar gap: Likely secondary to DKA as gap closed with anion
   gap closing and no calcium oxalate crystals seen on urine exam.
   Continuing to empirically treat for possible ethylene glycol intox with
   fomepizole until serum level comes back as negative.
   - f/u  methanol (alcohol profile), ethylene glycol
   .
   #. Coffee-ground emesis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be related retching ([**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear).
   Also possibility for ulceration given chemotherapy, radiation therapy.
   - GI consulted and does not recommend EGD as likely was M-W tear
   - Type and screen active
   - Repeat hematocrit Q6 hours until stable
   - Will change PPI IV drip to PPI IV BID
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Resolved.  Baseline creatinine 0.8 with
   creatinine 1.9 on admission. Given large volume diuresis associated
   with DKA and response to IVFs likely prerenal etiology. ATN also
   possibility. ?renal toxicity from recently started chemotherapeutic
   agents.
   - Continue hydration, as above
   .
   #. Right pleural effusion:  Known malignant pleural effusion. Will
   watch for indication of post-obstructive pneumonia. Afebrile and
   without leukocytosis, although does have left-shift.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of diabetic mellitus (DMI) and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

The patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential complications:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's AMS is likely related to DKA, but also concerns for metastatic disease to the brain and infection.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's anion and osmolar gap has closed, and he is receiving D5 1/2NS with KCl and insulin drip. However, he still requires aggressive electrolyte monitoring, particularly potassium, and careful monitoring of blood glucose levels.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient's serum potassium is low, reflecting low total body potassium depleted due to hyperglycemic diuresis and intracellular shift. He requires aggressive potassium repletion with a goal of K>4.5.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has a free water deficit and will require replacement with D5W.
5. Hyperosmolar gap: The patient's hyperosmolar gap is likely secondary to DKA, and he is being empirically treated for possible ethylene glycol intoxication with fomepizole until serum levels come back as negative.
6. Coffee-ground emesis: The patient has coffee-ground emesis, which may be related to retching or ulceration due to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
7. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine has increased from 0.8 to 1.9, likely due to prerenal etiology related to DKA and response to IVFs. ATN is also a possibility.
8. Right pleural effusion: The patient has a known malignant pleural effusion, and he will require monitoring for indication of post-obstructive pneumonia.
9. NSCLC: The patient is receiving chemotherapy, and he will require ongoing pain control and sedation.
10. Bipolar disorder: The patient is being held on his home medications, including Depakote, quietiapine, and venlafaxine, due to being NPO.
11. Hypertension: The patient is not on medication therapy for hypertension.
12. Hyperlipidemia: The patient is not on medication therapy for hyperlipidemia.

The patient's code status is full code, and he is being managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation, insulin drip, and careful monitoring of electrolytes and blood glucose levels. He will require ongoing pain control and sedation, and his wife and family will need to be involved in decision-making regarding his care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   #. Altered mental status:  Likely related to DKA on admission as
   hyperosmolar state can cause contraction of neurons. Also concern for
   metastatic disease to brain although had MRI in [**Month (only) 93**] without brain
   mets. Infection (VAP, aspiration pneumonia, encephalitis) is also a
   possibility although decreasing WBC count without abx agrues against
   this. Unable to do full neuro exam given mental status changes but
   followed commands during sedation holiday yesterday.
   - trend WBC count

   #. Hypokalemia:  Serum potassium now low reflecting low total body
   potassium depleted given hyperglycemic diuresis and intracellular shift
   now that acidosis is correcting.
   - Careful monitoring of electrolytes (Q6 hours)
   - Aggressive potassium repletion with goal K>4.5
   .
   #. Hypernatremia:  In setting of hyperosmolar gap on admission with
   free water deficit.  Will calculate free water deficit and replace with
   D5W (separate from the 1/2NS with KCl).
   # Hyperosmolar gap: Likely secondary to DKA as gap closed with anion
   gap closing and no calcium oxalate crystals seen on urine exam.
   Continuing to empirically treat for possible ethylene glycol intox with
   fomepizole until serum level comes back as negative.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The patient's condition has been stable over the past 24 hours, with no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory results.

The patient remains intubated due to respiratory failure, with a recent worsening of right lung collapse seen on chest X-ray. The differential diagnosis for the lung collapse includes infected effusion, post-obstructive pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's altered mental status is likely related to DKA, but infection, metastatic disease to the brain, or other causes cannot be ruled out. The patient's white blood cell count is decreasing, which argues against infection. The patient's sodium level is 153 mEq/L, and he has a free water deficit of 3L, which is being treated with D5 1/2NS and D5W.

The patient has hypokalemia, which is being treated with aggressive potassium repletion. He also has hypernatremia, which is being treated with D5W. The patient's anion and osmolar gap have closed, and he is no longer in DKA.

The patient has a right pleural effusion, which is known to be malignant. He is at risk for post-obstructive pneumonia, and his fever and leukocytosis are being monitored.

The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, but these conditions are not currently being treated.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's lung collapse and respiratory failure may worsen if not treated promptly.
2. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and decreasing white blood cell count make him at risk for infection, particularly VAP.
3. Metastatic disease: The patient's metastatic NSCLC may progress, leading to further complications.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient's hypokalemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and other complications if not treated promptly.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to central nervous system complications, such as seizures, if not treated promptly.
6. Right pleural effusion: The patient's right pleural effusion may worsen, leading to respiratory failure and other complications.
7. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress, leading to further complications.

The patient's treatment plan includes continued respiratory support, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and management of his electrolyte imbalances. He will also require close monitoring for signs of infection, metastatic disease, and other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following medical complications and concerns have arisen:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure, and a new right lung collapse was seen on the CXR. The differential diagnosis includes infected effusion, post-obstructive pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and VAP.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely related to DKA on admission, but infection, metastatic disease to the brain, and encephalitis are also possibilities.
3. Right Pleural Effusion: The patient has a known malignant pleural effusion, and the plan is to watch for signs of post-obstructive pneumonia and consider thoracentesis pending the results of the bronch.
4. Coffee-Ground Emesis: The patient has coffee-ground emesis, which could be related to retching or ulceration due to chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, likely due to medication-related side effects from chemotherapy and PPI.
6. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient has resolved DKA, but the plan is to continue insulin drip and start tube feeds after bronchoscopy.
7. Hypokalemia: The patient's hypokalemia has resolved with the resolution of DKA.
8. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia has resolved with repletion of free water.
9. Hyperosmolar Gap: The patient's hyperosmolar gap has resolved, likely secondary to DKA.
10. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure has resolved, likely due to prerenal etiology or ATN.

The patient is currently receiving the following medications:

* Fentanyl drip
* Propofol drip
* Insulin drip
* PPI IV BID
* Antihypertensive medications (not specified)
* Prophylactic antibiotics (not specified)

The patient's code status is full code, and they are being followed by the ICU team. The plan is to continue to monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   46M w/ Stage IV NSCLC, R pleural effusion, a/w DKA, c/b UGIB.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- initially intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with evidence for continued dependence for mechanical ventilation.
   Suspect multifactorial, including Right lung collapse/atalectasis,
   development of endobronchial lesion, progressive right pleural effusion
   (in context of volume expansion), evolving VAP, on background of large
   right pleural effusion.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation.  Monitor
   for evidence for VAP.  Plan bronchoscopy to assess airway patency.
   Large volume thoracentesis may not be possible, but will check with IP
   service.
   DELERIUM -- initally contributing to toxic/metabolic etiology
   (hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state).  Prior MRI w/o evidence of mets.
   Limit medications.  If develops fever (101) may need LP to r/o
   encephalitis.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Continue replete free water to correct.  Monitor Na.
   DKA
 Likely [**1-29**] med non-compliance (no insulin x 3d).  AG now
   closed.   Continued on insulin gtt, plan to transition when able to
   tolerate p.o./no longer requiring mechanical ventilation.   Continued
   on D5
 NS w/ K @ 250.  Monitor q6H
   OSMOLAR GAP -- Osmolar gap- now closed, d/c fomepizole until ethylene
   glycol neg.
   UGIB -- clinical concern for [**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **], but unclear.   Transition
   to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  GI Consultation following.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE --  improved with volume repletion.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF
   NSCLC, stage IV- Lg R pleural effusion.  Recent chemotherapy,
   ?palliative.
   Fever- 100.5, possibly [**1-29**] acute DKA, but concern for infection
   (including empyema, evolving VAP) or tumor (lung CA).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), right pleural effusion, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, with an unfavorable respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 154.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 108 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 107/73 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 99%, and the respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished appearance, with no acute distress. The patient's lungs are clear to auscultation, with no wheezing or rhonchi. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.8 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 198 x 10^9/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a mild hypernatremia.

The patient's medical conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, with an unfavorable RSBI of 154.
2. DKA: The patient has a history of DKA, which is currently being treated with insulin and fluid repletion.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a mild hypernatremia, which is being treated with free water repletion.
4. Osmolar gap: The patient has an osmolar gap, which is being treated with fomepizole.
5. UGIB: The patient has a clinical concern for upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which is being treated with proton pump inhibitors.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient has improved renal function with volume repletion.
7. NSCLC: The patient has stage IV NSCLC with a large right pleural effusion.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. VAP: The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to his prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Endobronchial lesion: The patient may develop an endobronchial lesion, which could worsen his respiratory failure.
3. Right pleural effusion: The patient's large right pleural effusion may continue to worsen, leading to respiratory compromise.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's DKA may recur if his insulin therapy is not continued or adjusted properly.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's mild hypernatremia may worsen if his fluid repletion is not continued or adjusted properly.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor for evidence of VAP.
2. Perform bronchoscopy to assess airway patency.
3. Continue insulin therapy and monitor for hyperglycemia.
4. Continue fluid repletion and monitor for electrolyte imbalance.
5. Consider transition to IV proton pump inhibitors for UGIB.
6. Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors.
7. Monitor for signs of sepsis or infection, including fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   46M w/ Stage IV NSCLC, R pleural effusion, a/w DKA, c/b UGIB.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- initially intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with evidence for continued dependence for mechanical ventilation.
   Suspect multifactorial, including Right lung collapse/atalectasis,
   development of endobronchial lesion, progressive right pleural effusion
   (in context of volume expansion), evolving VAP, on background of large
   right pleural effusion.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation.  Monitor
   for evidence for VAP.  Plan bronchoscopy to assess airway patency.
   Large volume thoracentesis may not be possible, but will check with IP
   service to assess success in recent pass.
   DELERIUM -- initally contributing to toxic/metabolic etiology
   (hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state).  Prior MRI w/o evidence of mets.
   Limit medications.  If develops fever (101) may need LP to r/o
   encephalitis.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Continue replete free water to maintain Na WNL.
   Monitor Na.
   DKA
 Likely [**1-29**] med non-compliance (no insulin x 3d).  AG now
   closed.   Continued on insulin gtt, plan to transition when able to
   tolerate p.o./no longer requiring mechanical ventilation.   Continued
   on D5
 NS w/ K @ 250.  Monitor q6H
   OSMOLAR GAP -- Osmolar gap- now closed, d/c fomepizole until ethylene
   glycol neg.
   UGIB -- clinical concern for [**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **], but unclear.   Transition
   to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  GI Consultation following.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE --  improved with volume repletion.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF
   NSCLC, stage IV- Lg R pleural effusion.  Recent chemotherapy,
   ?palliative.
   Fever- 100.5, possibly [**1-29**] acute DKA, but concern for infection
   (including empyema, evolving VAP) or tumor (lung CA).

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

* The patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a large right pleural effusion.
* He was initially intubated for airway protection due to respiratory failure, which is now suspected to be multifactorial, including right lung collapse/atalectasis, development of endobronchial lesion, progressive right pleural effusion, and evolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and is being monitored for evidence of VAP. A bronchoscopy is planned to assess airway patency.
* The patient has a history of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and is currently receiving insulin therapy. The underlying cause of DKA is suspected to be non-compliance with medication.
* The patient has a large volume thoracentesis with a possible pleural effusion.
* He has a fever of 100.5°F, which is potentially due to acute DKA, infection (including empyema or evolving VAP), or tumor (lung cancer).
* The patient's laboratory results show hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state, and an osmolal gap, which is now closed.
* The patient has acute renal failure, which has improved with volume repletion.
* He is receiving nutritional support with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and is being monitored for glycemic control.
* The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and is being treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure due to continued dependence on mechanical ventilation
* VAP, which can lead to pneumonia and sepsis
* Pleural effusion, which can lead to respiratory distress and potentially require large volume thoracentesis
* DKA, which can lead to metabolic acidosis and potentially life-threatening complications
* Hypernatremia, which can lead to dehydration and potentially life-threatening complications
* Acute renal failure, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and potentially require dialysis
* UGIB, which can lead to hemorrhagic shock and potentially life-threatening complications
* Osmolar gap, which can lead to neurological symptoms and potentially life-threatening complications
* Fever, which can lead to infection and potentially life-threatening complications."

   46M with DMI and metastatic NSCLC admitted with AMS, found to have DKA
   .
   #. Respiratory Failure:  Intubated to protect airway [**1-29**] agitation and
   vomiting.  New R lung collapse seen on CXR and failed RSBI this AM in
   setting of known R malignant pleural effusion from NSCLC.  Given
   collapse, will plan to do bronch today and pending results will
   consider [**Female First Name (un) 231**].  Differential includes infected effusion,
   post-obstructive pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, VAP.
   -bronch today
   - pending bronch, consider [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   .
   #. Altered mental status:  Likely related to DKA on admission as
   hyperosmolar state can cause contraction of neurons. Also concern for
   metastatic disease to brain although had MRI in [**Month (only) 93**] without brain
   mets. Infection (VAP, aspiration pneumonia, encephalitis) is also a
   possibility although decreasing WBC count without abx agrues against
   this. Unable to do full neuro exam given mental status changes but
   followed commands during sedation holiday yesterday.
   - trend WBC count
   - Continue to assess mental status with sedation weaning
   - Consider LP if worsening fever, WBC and no improvement
   .
   #. Right pleural effusion:  Known malignant pleural effusion. Will
   watch for indication of post-obstructive pneumonia.  Consider [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   pending results of bronch.
   -consider [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   .
   #. Coffee-ground emesis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be related retching ([**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear).
   Also possibility for ulceration given chemotherapy, radiation therapy.
   - GI consulted and does not recommend EGD as likely was M-W tear
   - Type and screen active
   - trend daily hematocrit
   - continue PPI IV BID
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt count decreasing since admission.  This is
   likely medication related as he just received chemo on [**8-6**] and he is
   on a PPI.
   -trend plt count
   .
   #. Diabetic ketoacidosis: Resolved. Anion and osmolar gap closed.
   Receiving D5NS at 75cc/hr and still on insulin drip.
   - start tube feeds after bronch and continue insulin drip
   - Once patient is able to tolerate POs, will bridge to subcutaneous
   insulin.
   - QID hour blood glucose monitoring
   - [**Last Name (un) 294**] following
   - Antiemetics
   .
   #. Hypokalemia:  Resolved with resolution of DKA.
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **] and replete as needed

   #. Hypernatremia:  Resolved after repletion of free water (had 3L
   deficit) with D5W yesterday in setting of hyperosmolar gap on
   admission.
   -monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of diffuse malignant infiltration (DMI) and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and found to have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with a right lung collapse and a failed rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) this morning. The differential diagnosis includes infected effusion, post-obstructive pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's mental status has improved with sedation weaning, but he is still unable to follow commands. The WBC count is trending downwards, and the patient is at risk for infection, including VAP, aspiration pneumonia, and encephalitis.

The patient's pleural effusion is known to be malignant, and the plan is to consider thoracentesis (Thx) pending the results of the bronchoscopy.

The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely medication-related, and the plan is to trend the platelet count.

The patient's DKA has resolved, and he is receiving D5NS at 75cc/hr and an insulin drip. The plan is to start tube feeds after the bronchoscopy and continue the insulin drip.

The patient's electrolyte abnormalities, including hypokalemia, hypernatremia, and hyperosmolar gap, have resolved. The patient's acute renal failure has also resolved, and the plan is to continue hydration.

The patient's oncological history includes stage IV NSCLC, and he has received chemotherapy and radiation therapy. He is currently receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin.

The patient's medical history includes bipolar disorder, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, but he is not currently receiving medication therapy for these conditions.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure due to the right lung collapse and VAP.
2. Infection, including VAP, aspiration pneumonia, and encephalitis, which may worsen the patient's mental status and respiratory status.
3. Thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia and hypernatremia, which may worsen the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status.
5. Acute kidney injury, which may worsen the patient's renal function.
6. Malignancy progression, which may worsen the patient's overall condition.

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU for now."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   -CXR: Right lung is now entirely collapsed with little if any increase
   in the volume of right pleural effusion
   -Bronchoscopy: Endobronchial lesion from carina to RLL subsegments -
   all of these orifices appeared narrowed, erythematous and edematous,
   easily collapsible. ?Extrinsic compression. No obvious
   secretions/mucous plugs.
   -IP: no fluid to tap; i.e. lung is collapsed - no/little effusion.
   -CT chest non-contrast ordered. To be done first thing in AM -hopefully
   ready for rounds.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), diabetes mellitus, and bipolar disorder. He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS), diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory status: Intubated with a right lung collapse, which is likely due to malignant pleural effusion from NSCLC. The patient is being considered for extubation to assess his ability to breathe spontaneously.
* Neurological status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be related to DKA, metastatic disease to the brain, or infection. His mental status is being closely monitored, and he is being weaned off sedation.
* Hematological status: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which is likely medication-related. His platelet count is being trended, and a head CT is being performed to evaluate for bleeding as a cause of AMS and agitation.
* Endocrine status: The patient has resolved DKA and is receiving D5NS at 75cc/hr and an insulin drip. He is being prepared for tube feeds and will be bridged to subcutaneous insulin once he is able to tolerate oral intake.
* Cardiovascular status: The patient has a history of hypertension, but his blood pressure is currently controlled. He is not on medication therapy at home.
* Gastrointestinal status: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, but he is not on medication therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's right lung collapse may worsen, leading to further respiratory failure.
* Infection: The patient is at risk for infection due to his immunocompromised state and the presence of a central venous catheter.
* Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and history of chemotherapy and radiation therapy may increase his risk of bleeding.
* Metastatic disease: The patient's metastatic NSCLC may progress, leading to further complications.
* Hyperglycemia: The patient's insulin drip may not be adequate to control his blood glucose levels, leading to hyperglycemia.
* Hypoglycemia: The patient's insulin drip may be too aggressive, leading to hypoglycemia.
* Hypotension: The patient's fluid resuscitation and medication regimen may lead to hypotension.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential complications, the physician's plan is to:

* Evaluate the patient's lungs with a CT chest to assess the extent of the right lung collapse and to rule out post-obstructive pneumonia.
* Consider extubation to assess the patient's ability to breathe spontaneously.
* Trend the patient's WBC count and add on diff to look for signs of infection.
* Continue to assess the patient's mental status with sedation weaning.
* Consider LP if the patient's fever, WBC count, and mental status do not improve.
* Restart the patient's depakote and seroquine, and hold venlafaxine.
* Give Haldol for acute agitation during rounds.
* Monitor the patient's platelet count and trend it to assess for bleeding risk.
* Perform a head CT to evaluate for bleeding as a cause of AMS and agitation.
* Restart tube feeds after the patient's CT chest and possible extubation.
* Continue insulin drip and QID hour blood glucose monitoring.
* Bridge the patient to subcutaneous insulin once he is able to tolerate oral intake.
* Restart the patient's palliative chemotherapy per oncologist."

   #. Respiratory Failure:  Intubated to protect airway [**1-29**] agitation and
   vomiting.  New R lung collapse seen on CXR and failed RSBI this AM in
   setting of known R malignant pleural effusion from NSCLC.  Given
   collapse, will plan to do bronch today and pending results will
   consider [**Female First Name (un) 231**].  Differential includes infected effusion,
   post-obstructive pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, VAP.
   -bronch today
   - pending bronch, consider [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   .
   #. Altered mental status:  Likely related to DKA on admission as
   hyperosmolar state can cause contraction of neurons. Also concern for
   metastatic disease to brain although had MRI in [**Month (only) 93**] without brain
   mets. Infection (VAP, aspiration pneumonia, encephalitis) is also a
   possibility although decreasing WBC count without abx agrues against
   this. Unable to do full neuro exam given mental status changes but
   followed commands during sedation holiday yesterday.
   - trend WBC count
   - Continue to assess mental status with sedation weaning
   - Consider LP if worsening fever, WBC and no improvement
   .
   #. Right pleural effusion:  Known malignant pleural effusion. Will
   watch for indication of post-obstructive pneumonia.  Consider [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   pending results of bronch.

   #. Coffee-ground emesis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be related retching ([**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **] tear).
   Also possibility for ulceration given chemotherapy, radiation therapy.
   - Type and screen active
   - trend daily hematocrit
   - continue PPI IV BID
   manage
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt count decreasing since admission.  This is
   likely medication related as he just received chemo on [**8-6**] and he is
   on a PPI.
   -trend plt count
   .
   #. Diabetic ketoacidosis: Resolved. Anion and osmolar gap closed.
   Receiving D5NS at 75cc/hr and still on insulin drip.
   - start tube feeds after bronch and continue insulin drip
   - Once patient is able to tolerate POs, will bridge to subcutaneous
   insulin.
   - QID hour blood glucose monitoring
   -[**Last Name (un) 294**] recs: Continue IVF D5 NS; When ready to transition out of ICU
   and off drip, would start NPH 8U q8H and humalog sliding scale b**d on
   insulin needs once TF on board.
   - Antiemetics
   .
   #. Hypokalemia:  Resolved with resolution of DKA.
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **] and replete as needed
   .
   #. Hypernatremia:  Resolved after repletion of free water (had 3L
   deficit) with D5W yesterday in setting of hyperosmolar gap on
   admission.
   -monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   .
   # Hyperosmolar gap: Resolved.  Likely secondary to DKA as gap closed
   with anion gap closing and no calcium oxalate crystals seen on urine
   exam.  Briefly treated empirically for possible ethylene glycol intox
   with fomepizole.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Resolved.  Baseline creatinine 0.8 with
   creatinine 1.9 on admission. Given large volume diuresis associated
   with DKA and response to IVFs likely prerenal etiology. ATN also
   possibility. ?renal toxicity from recently started chemotherapeutic
   agents.
   - Continue hydration, as above

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient's condition is concerning due to the following:

1. Right lung collapse: The patient's right lung is entirely collapsed with little to no increase in the volume of right pleural effusion. This could be related to the known malignant pleural effusion from NSCLC, or it could be due to extrinsic compression or post-obstructive pneumonia.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's AMS is likely related to DKA, but it is also possible that it is related to metastatic disease to the brain or infection (VAP, aspiration pneumonia, or encephalitis).
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which is likely related to medication, specifically chemotherapy and proton pump inhibitors.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's DKA has resolved, but he is still receiving insulin and IV fluids.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has improved, but it is still elevated, and he may have prerenal or postrenal etiology.
6. NSCLC: The patient is receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy, which may be contributing to his current condition.
7. Hypokalemia and hypernatremia: The patient's electrolyte levels are abnormal, which may be related to his DKA and treatment.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's right lung collapse and pleural effusion increase the risk of pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's AMS and fever may indicate sepsis, which could be related to pneumonia, VAP, or other infections.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
4. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia increases the risk of bleeding, especially with invasive procedures or trauma.
5. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and invasive devices increase the risk of infection, including VAP, pneumonia, and bloodstream infections.
6. Metastatic disease: The patient's NSCLC may progress and spread to other organs, including the brain, liver, or bones.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Bronchoscopy to assess the airway and rule out post-obstructive pneumonia.
2. Monitoring of electrolyte levels and repletion as needed.
3. Continue IV fluids and insulin drip.
4. Weaning of sedation and assessing mental status.
5. Trending of platelet count and considering platelet transfusion if necessary.
6. Monitoring of respiratory status and adjusting ventilation settings as needed.
7. Considering LP if worsening fever and WBC count without improvement.
8. Continuing oncological therapy and following up with oncological recommendations."

   Assessment and Plan
   46 yom Stage IV NSCLC, R pleural effusion, s/p DKA and mild UGIB., now
   with progressive right atalectasis and respiratory failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- initially intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with evidence for continued dependence for mechanical ventilation.
   Suspect multifactorial, including Right lung collapse/atalectasis,
   perhaps progressive right pleural effusion (in context of volume
   expansion), evolving VAP.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation.
   Monitor for evidence for VAP.  Chest CT to evaluate right thorax
   anatomy.
   DELERIUM -- initally contributing to toxic/metabolic etiology
   (hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state).  Prior MRI w/o evidence of mets.
   Limit medications.  Resume usual psych medications.  If develops fever
   (101) may need LP to r/o encephalitis.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Resolved.  Monitor Na.
   DKA
 Likely [**1-29**] med non-compliance (no insulin x 3d).  AG now
   closed.   Continued on insulin gtt, plan to transition when able to
   tolerate p.o./no longer requiring mechanical ventilation.   Continued
   on D5
 NS w/ K @ 250.  Monitor q6H
   OSMOLAR GAP -- Osmolar gap- now closed, d/c fomepizole until ethylene
   glycol neg.
   UGIB -- clinical concern for [**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **], but unclear.   Transition
   to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  GI Consultation following.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE --  improved with volume repletion.  Monitor
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   NSCLC, stage IV- Right pleural effusion, now with right lung
   atalectasis due to extrinsic compression.   Recent chemotherapy,
   ?palliative.
   Fever- 100.5, possibly [**1-29**] acute DKA, but concern for infection
   (including empyema, evolving VAP) or tumor (lung CA).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   46 yom Stage IV NSCLC, R pleural effusion, s/p DKA and mild UGIB., now
   with progressive right atalectasis and respiratory failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- initially intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with evidence for continued dependence for mechanical ventilation.
   Suspect multifactorial, including Right lung collapse/atalectasis,
   perhaps progressive right pleural effusion (in context of volume
   expansion), evolving VAP.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation.
   Monitor for evidence for VAP.  Chest CT to evaluate right thorax
   anatomy.
   DELERIUM -- initally contributing to toxic/metabolic etiology
   (hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state).  Prior MRI w/o evidence of mets.
   Limit medications.  Resume usual psych medications.  If develops fever
   (101) may need LP to r/o encephalitis.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Resolved.  Monitor Na.
   DKA
 Likely [**1-29**] med non-compliance (no insulin x 3d).  AG now
   closed.   Continued on insulin gtt, plan to transition when able to
   tolerate p.o./no longer requiring mechanical ventilation.   Continued
   on D5
 NS w/ K @ 250.  Monitor q6H
   OSMOLAR GAP -- Osmolar gap- now closed, d/c fomepizole until ethylene
   glycol neg.
   UGIB -- clinical concern for [**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **], but unclear.   Transition
   to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  GI Consultation following.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE --  improved with volume repletion.  Monitor
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   NSCLC, stage IV- Right pleural effusion, now with right lung
   atalectasis due to extrinsic compression.   Recent chemotherapy,
   ?palliative.
   Fever- 100.5, possibly [**1-29**] acute DKA, but concern for infection
   (including empyema, evolving VAP) or tumor (lung CA).

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of right pleural effusion, DKA, and mild upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient is also experiencing hypernatremia, osmolal gap, and acute renal failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to continued dependence on the ventilator.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is stable, with a heart rate of 113 beats per minute.
* Neurological: The patient is sedated and has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 8.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a nasogastric tube in place and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is improving with volume repletion.
* Endocrine: The patient has hypernatremia, which has resolved with treatment.
* Infectious: The patient has a fever of 100.5°F, which may be related to acute DKA, infection (including empyema or evolving ventilator-associated pneumonia), or tumor (lung CA).

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 7.8 x 10^9/L, Hct 25.6%, Plt 198 x 10^9/L
* Blood Chemistry: Na 143 mmol/L, K 4.3 mmol/L, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL, Glucose 44 mg/dL
* Coagulation Studies: PT 12.5 seconds, PTT 27.9 seconds, INR 1.1

The patient's plan of care is as follows:

* Continue mechanical ventilation and monitor for evidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* Limit medications and resume usual psych medications.
* Monitor for evidence of delirium and adjust medications as needed.
* Continue IV PPI and GI consultation.
* Monitor for signs of infection and adjust antibiotics as needed.
* Continue total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and monitor for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Monitor for signs of acute renal failure and adjust fluid management as needed.
* Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is ICU. The patient's total time spent in the ICU is 45 minutes."

   Assessment and Plan
   46 yom Stage IV NSCLC, R pleural effusion, s/p DKA and mild UGIB., now
   with progressive right atalectasis and respiratory failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- initially intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with evidence for continued dependence for mechanical ventilation.
   Suspect multifactorial, including Right lung collapse/atalectasis,
   perhaps progressive right pleural effusion (in context of volume
   expansion), evolving VAP.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation.
   Monitor for evidence for VAP.  Chest CT to evaluate right thorax
   anatomy.
   DELERIUM -- initally contributing to toxic/metabolic etiology
   (hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state).  Prior MRI w/o evidence of mets.
   Limit medications.  Resume usual psych medications.  If develops fever
   (101) may need LP to r/o encephalitis.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Resolved.  Monitor Na.
   DKA
 Likely [**1-29**] med non-compliance (no insulin x 3d).  AG now
   closed.   Continued on insulin gtt, plan to transition when able to
   tolerate p.o./no longer requiring mechanical ventilation.   Continued
   on D5
 NS w/ K @ 250.  Monitor q6H
   OSMOLAR GAP -- Osmolar gap- now closed, d/c fomepizole until ethylene
   glycol neg.
   UGIB -- clinical concern for [**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **], but unclear.   Transition
   to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  GI Consultation following.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE --  improved with volume repletion.  Monitor
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   NSCLC, stage IV- Right pleural effusion, now with right lung
   atalectasis due to extrinsic compression.   Recent chemotherapy,
   ?palliative.
   Fever- 100.5, possibly [**1-29**] acute DKA, but concern for infection
   (including empyema, evolving VAP) or tumor (lung CA).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), right pleural effusion, and s/p DKA and mild Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding (UGIB). He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of non-compliance with medication, which likely contributed to his DKA episode. He also has a suspected multifactorial respiratory failure, including right lung collapse/atalectasis, progressive right pleural effusion, and evolving Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP). The patient is also at risk for delirium, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, and continued mechanical ventilation is necessary to maintain his airway. However, the patient's dependence on mechanical ventilation increases the risk of VAP, which can lead to respiratory failure and mortality.
2. VAP: The patient's risk factors for VAP include being intubated and mechanically ventilated, and the presence of a central venous catheter. Early detection and treatment of VAP are crucial to prevent further complications.
3. Delirium: The patient's delirium is likely contributing to his toxic and metabolic etiology. Limiting medications and resuming usual psych medications may help alleviate his delirium. However, if he develops fever, a lumbar puncture (LP) may be necessary to rule out encephalitis.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia has resolved, but monitoring his sodium levels is crucial to prevent future episodes.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure has improved with volume repletion, but continued monitoring is necessary to prevent further complications.
6. Osmolar Gap: The patient's osmolal gap is now closed, but d/c fomepizole until ethylene glycol is negative.
7. UGIB: The patient's UGIB is a clinical concern, and transitioning to IV PPI and consulting with a gastroenterologist may help alleviate his symptoms.
8. NSCLC: The patient's NSCLC is a significant concern, and his recent chemotherapy may have contributed to his respiratory failure. Palliative care may be necessary to manage his symptoms and improve his quality of life.

Recommendations:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation to maintain the patient's airway.
2. Monitor the patient for signs of VAP and treat promptly if suspected.
3. Limit medications and resume usual psych medications to alleviate delirium.
4. Monitor the patient's sodium levels to prevent hypernatremia.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function to prevent acute renal failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   46 yom Stage IV NSCLC, R pleural effusion, s/p DKA and mild UGIB., now
   with progressive right atalectasis and respiratory failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- initially intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with evidence for continued dependence for mechanical ventilation.
   Suspect multifactorial, including Right lung collapse/atalectasis,
   perhaps progressive right pleural effusion (in context of volume
   expansion), evolving VAP.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation.
   Monitor for evidence for VAP.  Chest CT to evaluate right thorax
   anatomy.
   DELERIUM -- initally contributing to toxic/metabolic etiology
   (hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state).  Prior MRI w/o evidence of mets.
   Limit medications.  Resume usual psych medications.  If develops fever
   (101) may need LP to r/o encephalitis.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Resolved.  Monitor Na.
   DKA
 Likely [**1-29**] med non-compliance (no insulin x 3d).  AG now
   closed.   Continued on insulin gtt, plan to transition when able to
   tolerate p.o./no longer requiring mechanical ventilation.   Continued
   on D5
 NS w/ K @ 250.  Monitor q6H
   OSMOLAR GAP -- Osmolar gap- now closed, d/c fomepizole until ethylene
   glycol neg.
   UGIB -- clinical concern for [**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **], but unclear.   Transition
   to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  GI Consultation following.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE --  improved with volume repletion.  Monitor
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   NSCLC, stage IV- Right pleural effusion, now with right lung
   atalectasis due to extrinsic compression.   Recent chemotherapy,
   ?palliative.
   Fever- 100.5, possibly [**1-29**] acute DKA, but concern for infection
   (including empyema, evolving VAP) or tumor (lung CA).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   46 yom Stage IV NSCLC, R pleural effusion, s/p DKA and mild UGIB., now
   with progressive right atalectasis and respiratory failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- initially intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with evidence for continued dependence for mechanical ventilation.
   Suspect multifactorial, including Right lung collapse/atalectasis,
   perhaps progressive right pleural effusion (in context of volume
   expansion), evolving VAP.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation.
   Monitor for evidence for VAP.  Chest CT to evaluate right thorax
   anatomy.
   DELERIUM -- initally contributing to toxic/metabolic etiology
   (hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state).  Prior MRI w/o evidence of mets.
   Limit medications.  Resume usual psych medications.  If develops fever
   (101) may need LP to r/o encephalitis.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Resolved.  Monitor Na.
   DKA
 Likely [**1-29**] med non-compliance (no insulin x 3d).  AG now
   closed.   Continued on insulin gtt, plan to transition when able to
   tolerate p.o./no longer requiring mechanical ventilation.   Continued
   on D5
 NS w/ K @ 250.  Monitor q6H
   OSMOLAR GAP -- Osmolar gap- now closed, d/c fomepizole until ethylene
   glycol neg.
   UGIB -- clinical concern for [**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **], but unclear.   Transition
   to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  GI Consultation following.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE --  improved with volume repletion.  Monitor
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   NSCLC, stage IV- Right pleural effusion, now with right lung
   atalectasis due to extrinsic compression.   Recent chemotherapy,
   ?palliative.
   Fever- 100.5, possibly [**1-29**] acute DKA, but concern for infection
   (including empyema, evolving VAP) or tumor (lung CA).

   ------ Protected Section ------
   MICU Attending Addendum:
   Extensive family discussion, involving wife and sister and brother.
   Representatives from Oncology and MICU services present.  Updated
   medical condition and answered all questions.  All recognize extent of
   underlying malignancy.  Discussed treatment of pulmonary embolism
   plan for IVC filter and lovenox.  Hope for extubation trial and further
   discussion with patient.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of diabetes, hypernatremia, and mild upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to progressive right lung collapse/atalectasis and respiratory failure. There is suspicion of multifactorial etiology, including right lung collapse/atalectasis, progressive right pleural effusion, and evolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* Cardiovascular: The patient's cardiac status is stable, with a normal heart rhythm and blood pressure.
* Neurological: The patient is sedated and has a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 12.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of mild UGIB and is currently receiving IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, which has improved with volume repletion.
* Nutritional: The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and is being monitored for glycemic control.
* Infection: The patient has a fever of 100.5°F, which may be related to acute DKA, infection (including empyema or evolving VAP), or tumor (lung CA).

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's fever and tachycardia may be indicative of sepsis, which could worsen his respiratory and cardiovascular status.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if he continues to have inadequate fluid resuscitation or if he develops sepsis.
4. Worsening lung collapse/atalectasis: The patient's right lung collapse/atalectasis may worsen if he continues to have inadequate ventilation or if he develops pneumonia.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia may worsen if he is not receiving adequate insulin therapy or if he develops sepsis.

The patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continue mechanical ventilation to support his respiratory status.
2. Monitor for signs of VAP and sepsis.
3. Initiate total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to provide adequate nutrition.
4. Monitor glycemic control and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
5. Continue IV PPI therapy to manage UGIB.
6. Monitor for signs of worsening lung collapse/atalectasis and pneumonia.
7. Consider placement of an IVC filter to prevent pulmonary embolism.
8. Discuss treatment options with the patient and his family, including further chemotherapy and palliative care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   .
   #. Altered mental status:  [**Month (only) 11**] have been related to DKA on admission as
   hyperosmolar state can cause contraction of neurons. Also concern for
   metastatic disease to brain although had MRI in [**Month (only) 93**] without brain mets
   and non-contrast head CT yesterday without signs of bleed. Infection
   (VAP, aspiration pneumonia, encephalitis) is also a possibility
   although decreasing WBC count without abx agrues against this. Other
   underlying issue is his bipolar disorder.  Just restarted his seroquel
   and depakote yesterday now that he is taking POs.  Plan to restart

Summary:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, insulinoma, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status (AMS) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which has since resolved. He has a pulmonary thrombus and a large mass with little lung tissue, seen on chest CT. He has been extubated and is now receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 128 bpm and blood pressure of 122/67 mmHg. He has tachycardia, which is likely related to his pulmonary thrombus, and is being monitored.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary thrombosis: The patient has a pulmonary thrombus and a large mass with little lung tissue, which can lead to respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he may be at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying lung disease and pulmonary thrombosis.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which may be related to his chemotherapy and medication.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is decreasing, which may be related to his underlying disease and chemotherapy.
5. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient has a history of DKA, which can recur if his diabetes is not properly managed.
6. Bipolar disorder: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, which may be exacerbated by his current medical condition and treatment.
7. Coffee-ground emesis: The patient has a history of coffee-ground emesis, which may be related to his chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
8. NSCLC: The patient has metastatic NSCLC, which is a potentially life-threatening condition.
9. IVC filter: The patient may require an IVC filter to prevent further pulmonary thrombosis.

Assessment and plan:

1. Trend WBC count to monitor for infection.
2. Continue depakote and seroquel to manage the patient's bipolar disorder.
3. Restart home venlafaxine to manage the patient's depression.
4. Monitor HR to ensure that it is not related to pain, hypovolemia, arrhythmia, or agitation/anxiety.
5. Plan for possible IVC filter to prevent further pulmonary thrombosis.
6. Monitor hct to ensure that it is not decreasing further.
7. Continue PPI IV BID to manage the patient's gastritis.
8. Manage the patient's pain and sedation with fentanyl patch and morphine PRN.
9. Consult palliative care to discuss goals of care with the patient and his family."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DMI) and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and found to have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He was intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently receiving insulin drip and D5NS. His vital signs are stable, but he has tachycardia and is at risk for bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. He is also at risk for infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to his underlying lung cancer and pleural effusion. He may require further evaluation with a CT chest to determine the extent of his disease.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's AMS may be related to his DKA, but it could also be caused by his underlying cancer or infection. He requires further evaluation with a CT head to rule out bleeding or metastatic disease.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which may be related to his chemotherapy or medication. He requires further monitoring and treatment to prevent bleeding.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk for infection, particularly VAP, due to his intubation. He requires further evaluation with a CT chest and a comprehensive antibiotic regimen.
5. Bleeding: The patient is at risk for bleeding due to his thrombocytopenia and recent chemotherapy. He requires further evaluation with a CT head to rule out bleeding or metastatic disease.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient is at risk for hypoglycemia due to his insulin drip and D5NS. He requires further monitoring and treatment to prevent hypoglycemia.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient is at risk for hyperglycemia due to his DKA and insulin drip. He requires further monitoring and treatment to prevent hyperglycemia.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results.
2. Perform a CT chest to evaluate the extent of the patient's lung disease.
3. Perform a CT head to rule out bleeding or metastatic disease.
4. Continue to treat the patient's respiratory failure with oxygen therapy and possible extubation.
5. Continue to treat the patient's AMS with sedation and possible intubation.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and treat any bleeding or thrombocytopenia.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's glucose levels and treat any hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
8. Consider restarting the patient's antipsychotic medication and continue to monitor his mental status.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's wound and prevent infection.
10. Consider discharging the patient to a rehabilitation facility once he is stable and able to tolerate a regular diet."

   Assessment and Plan
   46 yom Stage IV NSCLC, R pleural effusion, s/p DKA and mild UGIB., now
   with progressive right atalectasis and respiratory failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- stable s/p extubation.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM -- evidence for acute by CT scan.  Plan trial of
   lovenox and placement of IVC filter.
   DELIRIUM -- initally attributing to toxic/metabolic etiology
   (hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state), and witholding of usual
   psychiatric medications.  Since extubation, now resuming usual PO
   meds.
   TACHYCARDIA -- likely multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism,
   hypovolemia, anxiety.  Also consider pericardial involvement by lung
   cancer.
   DKA
 improved, but remains on insulin drip.  Plan to transition to
   subcutaneous insulin.  [**Last Name (un) 294**] Consultation in progress.
   UGIB -- clinical concern for [**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **], but unclear.   Transition
   to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  GI Consultation following.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE --  improved with volume repletion.  Monitor uo,
   creatinine.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   NSCLC, stage IV- Right pleural effusion, now with right lung
   atalectasis due to extrinsic compression.   Recent chemotherapy,
   ?palliative.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), right pleural effusion, and recent chemotherapy. The patient was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and mild upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).

The patient's current condition is:

* Respiratory failure: The patient is stable after extubation, but has progressive right atelectasis and respiratory failure.
* Pulmonary embolism: The patient has evidence of acute pulmonary embolism on CT scan, and a plan is in place to trial lovenox and place an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter.
* Delirium: The patient's delirium is attributed to toxic/metabolic etiology (hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state), and usual psychiatric medications are being withheld. However, since extubation, the patient is now being resumed on usual oral medications.
* Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism, hypovolemia, anxiety, and possible pericardial involvement by lung cancer.
* DKA: The patient's DKA has improved, but remains on an insulin drip. A plan is in place to transition to subcutaneous insulin.
* UGIB: The patient has a clinical concern for upper gastrointestinal bleeding, but the cause is unclear. The patient will be transitioned to IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and a gastrointestinal consultation will follow.
* Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure has improved with volume repletion, and will be monitored for uro and creatinine levels.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 6.0-9.1
* Hct: 24.4-30.6
* Plt: 43-128
* Cr: 0.6-0.9
* TCO2: 27
* Glucose: 47-139
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.5/27.9/1.1, Alk Phos/T Bili: 0.1, Differential-Neuts: 89.9%, Lymph: 8.4%, Mono: 0.5%, Eos: 1.0%, Lactic Acid: 1.3 mmol/L, Albumin: 2.3 g/dL, LDH: 169 IU/L, Ca++: 7.4 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.6 mg/dL, PO4: 3.7 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes:

* Stage IV NSCLC with right pleural effusion
* Recent chemotherapy
* DKA and mild UGIB

The patient's current medications include:

* Insulin drip
* Lovenox
* PPI
* IV antibiotics
* Other medications as needed

The patient's ICU care plan includes:

* Nutrition: Initiate total parenteral nutrition (TF)
* Glycemic control: Monitor glucose levels and adjust insulin drip as needed
* Lines: Arterial line, central venous catheter, and peripheral IV lines
* Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with boots, systemic anticoagulation with lovenox, stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, and VAP prophylaxis with HOB elevation.

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU. The patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   46 yom Stage IV NSCLC, R pleural effusion, s/p DKA and mild UGIB., now
   with progressive right atalectasis and respiratory failure
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- stable s/p extubation.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM -- evidence for acute by CT scan.  Plan trial of
   lovenox and placement of IVC filter.
   DELIRIUM -- initally attributing to toxic/metabolic etiology
   (hypernatremia, hyperosmolar state), and witholding of usual
   psychiatric medications.  Since extubation, now resuming usual PO
   meds.
   TACHYCARDIA -- likely multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism,
   hypovolemia, anxiety.  Also consider pericardial involvement by lung
   cancer.
   DKA
 improved, but remains on insulin drip.  Plan to transition to
   subcutaneous insulin.  [**Last Name (un) 294**] Consultation in progress.
   UGIB -- clinical concern for [**Doctor First Name 331**]-[**Doctor Last Name **], but unclear.   Transition
   to IV PPI [**Hospital1 **].  GI Consultation following.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE --  improved with volume repletion.  Monitor uo,
   creatinine.
   NUTRIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF.
   NSCLC, stage IV- Right pleural effusion, now with right lung
   atalectasis due to extrinsic compression.   Recent chemotherapy,

   Disposition :ICU
   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who has developed respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, and acute kidney injury (AKI) due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient was recently extubated and is experiencing intermittent agitation, expressing concerns about harm coming to himself or others.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 121 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 119/78 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen and standby ventilator mode.

The patient has a history of DKA, which has improved with insulin therapy, but he remains on an insulin drip. He also has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) and is at risk for further bleeding.

The patient's laboratory results show evidence of AKI, with a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 25 mg/dL. His electrolyte levels are abnormal, with hypokalemia (potassium 3.6 mEq/L) and hypomagnesemia (magnesium 1.6 mg/dL).

The patient has a diagnosis of schizophrenia and is receiving psychiatric consultation. He is also at risk for delirium due to his underlying medical conditions and medication use.

The patient's plan includes:

1. Continued insulin therapy to manage DKA.
2. Trial of lovenox and placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter to treat pulmonary embolism.
3. Resumption of usual psychiatric medications to manage delirium.
4. Monitoring of urological output and creatinine levels to assess AKI.
5. Initiation of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to support nutritional needs.
6. Ongoing psychiatric consultation to manage schizophrenia.
7. ICU care, including prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Further respiratory failure due to pulmonary embolism or atelectasis.
2. Worsening AKI due to continued hypovolemia or underlying kidney disease.
3. Increased risk of bleeding due to UGIB or anticoagulation therapy.
4. Development of sepsis or septic shock due to underlying infections.
5. Cardiovascular complications, such as pericardial involvement by lung cancer or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Increased risk of delirium or psychosis due to underlying medical conditions or medication use.
7. Failure to wean from mechanical ventilation or develop respiratory failure due to inadequate respiratory support."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of type I diabetes, hypertension, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with altered mental status, which was attributed to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's condition has since improved, and he is now receiving insulin sliding scale (ISS) and has been transitioned off the insulin drip. However, he still requires close monitoring of his blood glucose levels.

The patient has several potential medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Pulmonary thrombus: The patient has a pulmonary thrombus, which is being treated with lovenox. However, the medication has been held due to thrombocytopenia and a new drop in hematocrit.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be related to his pulmonary thrombus, pain, hypovolemia, arrhythmia, or anxiety.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which may be related to medication or his underlying medical condition.
4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit is stable, but he is at risk for further bleeding due to his history of gastrointestinal bleeding and his current use of anticoagulant medications.
5. Right pleural effusion: The patient has a known malignant pleural effusion, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
6. Bipolar disorder: The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, which may be contributing to his altered mental status and suicidal ideation.
7. Coffee-ground emesis: The patient had coffee-ground emesis on admission, which may be related to his underlying medical condition or medication side effects.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's pulmonary thrombus may progress and cause a pulmonary embolism.
2. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and anemia may increase his risk of bleeding, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract.
3. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and decreased white blood cell count may increase his risk of infection.
4. Metastatic disease: The patient's metastatic NSCLC may progress and cause further complications.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his potential medical complications. He should be continued on his current medications, including insulin, lovenox, and anticoagulant medications. The patient's hematocrit and platelet count should be closely monitored, and he should be evaluated for further bleeding or infection."

   # Pulmonary thrombus: In situ R interlobar pulmonary thrombosis seen on
   CT.  Treated with lovenox but given thrombocytopenia and new hct drop,
   lovenox held. Hct stable. Pt received dose of lovenox yesterday. LENI
   demonstrate clot in legs.
   -IVC filter today
   -Hold lovenox for procedure today
   .
   #. Altered Mental status:  [**Month (only) 11**] have been related to DKA on admission as
   hyperosmolar state can cause contraction of neurons. Also concern for
   metastatic disease to brain although had MRI in [**Month (only) 93**] without brain mets
   and non-contrast head CT yesterday without signs of bleed. Infection
   (VAP, aspiration pneumonia, encephalitis) is also a possibility
   although decreasing WBC count without abx agrues against this. Also
   consider his bipolar disorder. Restarted his seroquel, depakote , and
   venlafaxine.

   # Tachycardia:  Likely related to his pulmonary thrombus but must also
   consider pain, hypovolemia, arrhythmia, and agitation/anxiety.  HR did
   not respond to 500cc fluid bolus, haldol or morphine, supporting that
   etiology is likely PE.

   #. Right pleural effusion:  Known malignant pleural effusion although
   not enough fluid for thoracentesis. Will watch for indication of
   post-obstructive pneumonia.

   # Thrombocytopenia: Plt count decreasing since admission. Received one
   unit platelets overnight. This is likely medication related as he just
   received chemo on [**8-6**] and he is on a PPI.
   -trend plt count

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tachycardic, with a heart rate of 109 beats per minute; blood pressure of 158/84 mmHg; respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute; and oxygen saturation of 96% on room air.
* Physical examination: The patient is lying in bed, answers questions appropriately, and follows commands. He has basilar crackles on the left lung, bronchial breath sounds on the right lung, and expiratory wheeze on the left lung. His abdomen is nondistended, with hypoactive bowel sounds, soft, and diffusely tender, with the greatest tenderness in the right upper quadrant.
* Laboratory results: The patient has a white blood cell count of 9.1 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dL, platelet count of 74 x 10^9/L, and a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL.

The patient's medical complications include:

* Pulmonary thrombus: In situ right interlobar pulmonary thrombosis seen on CT scan.
* Altered mental status: The patient has had altered mental status since admission, which has been attributed to DKA on admission and concern for metastatic disease to the brain.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing since admission and is currently 74 x 10^9/L.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 8.5 g/dL.
* Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient had DKA on admission, which has since resolved.
* Coffee-ground emesis: The patient had coffee-ground emesis on admission, which has since resolved.
* NSCLC: The patient has undergone chemotherapy and radiation therapy for his NSCLC.

The patient's medications include:

* Insulin sliding scale
* Fondaparinux
* Lovenox (held today for IVC filter placement)
* Pantoprazole (Protonix)
* Haloperidol (Haldol)
* Morphine
* Fentanyl patch
* Depakote
* Seroquel
* Venlafaxine
* Lorazepam (discontinued)
* Dronabinol (discontinued)

The patient's plan includes:

* IVC filter placement today
* Holding lovenox for procedure today
* Restarting Depakote, Seroquel, and Venlafaxine
* Adding another medication for bipolar disorder
* Continuing Haldol PRN
* Monitoring HR
* Trending plt count
* Trending daily hematocrit
* Continuing PPI IV BID
* Managing pain control and sedation
* Receiving palliative chemo per onc
* Palliative care to see patient today
* Regular DM diet
* Replete lytes
* D5NS at 150cc/hr and insulin drip

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   (VAP, aspiration pneumonia, encephalitis) is also a possibility
   although decreasing WBC count without abx agrues against this. Also
   consider his bipolar disorder. Restarted his seroquel, depakote , and

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of type I diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). He was admitted with altered mental status (AMS) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which has since resolved.

The patient is currently experiencing tachycardia, likely related to his pulmonary thrombus, and thrombocytopenia, which is likely due to chemotherapy. He is also experiencing abdominal pain, particularly in the right upper quadrant (RUQ), which he attributes to stooling too much.

The patient has a history of bipolar disorder, and his mental status has been altered due to DKA and possibly metastatic disease to the brain. He is being treated with antipsychotic medications, including haloperidol, and is being monitored for QTc prolongation.

The patient has a right pleural effusion, which is known to be malignant, and is being monitored for signs of post-obstructive pneumonia.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 9.1
* Hct: 27.9
* Plt: 74
* Cr: 0.8
* TCO2: 27
* Glucose: 77
* Ca++: 7.6 mg/dL
* Mg++: 1.6 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.5 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Pulmonary thrombus: In situ R interlobar pulmonary thrombosis seen on CT
* LENI: Occlusive thrombus within one of the paired left posterior tibial veins and the left peroneal vein, and nonocclusive thrombus mobile within the lumen of the right common femoral vein
* MRI: No brain metastases seen
* Non-contrast head CT: No signs of bleed

The patient's medications include:

* Fondaparinux (hold today for IVC filter placement)
* Pantoprazole (Protonix) IV BID
* Haloperidol (Haldol) PRN
* Morphine PRN
* Fentanyl patch
* Depakote
* Seroquel
* Venlafaxine
* Insulin sliding scale (ISS)
* Platelets (1 unit received overnight)

The patient's plan includes:

* IVC filter placement today
* Fondaparinux for DVT/PE treatment
* Palliative care consultation today
* Restarting Depakote, seroquel, and venlafaxine
* Continuing Haldol PRN
* EKG to evaluate for QTc prolongation
* Repleting K and Mg PRN
* Monitoring HR
* Trending plt count
* Transfusing to plt goal > 20
* Active type and screen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), right pleural effusion, and recent DKA and mild upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He is currently experiencing progressive right atelectasis and respiratory failure, with evidence of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on computed tomography (CT) scan. He has also developed thrombocytopenia, likely due to chemotherapy, and acute renal failure, which has improved with volume repletion.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 103 beats per minute (bpm), and blood pressure of 145/85 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula. His physical examination is notable for right lower extremity edema, trace.

Laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated creatinine level.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's respiratory failure is stable after extubation, and he is being monitored for respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. A pulmonary embolism is suspected, and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed. Anticoagulation therapy is being continued. Delirium has improved with resumption of usual oral medications, and the patient is being monitored for electrocardiogram (ECG) QT interval.

The patient's tachycardia is likely multifactorial, including pulmonary embolism, hypovolemia, anxiety, and potential pericardial involvement by lung cancer. DKA has improved, and a consultation with a nephrologist is being pursued. Thrombocytopenia is likely due to chemotherapy, and the patient's platelet count is being monitored.

UGIB is a clinical concern, and the patient is being transitioned to intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. A gastroenterology consultation is being scheduled. Acute renal failure has improved with volume repletion, and the patient's urine output and creatinine levels are being monitored.

The patient's nutritional support is being initiated, and glycemic control is being monitored. He has a 20-gauge and 22-gauge central venous catheter, and prophylaxis is being provided for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is stable, but he is at risk for further deterioration if his respiratory rate and oxygen saturation are not closely monitored.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has evidence of acute pulmonary embolism, which can lead to further respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient has bilateral deep vein thrombosis, which can lead to further thrombotic events and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely due to chemotherapy, but it can lead to bleeding complications if not closely monitored.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure has improved, but he is at risk for further deterioration if his urine output and creatinine levels are not closely monitored.
6. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's UGIB is a clinical concern, and he is at risk for further bleeding if not closely monitored and treated.
7. Delirium: The patient's delirium has improved, but he is at risk for further episodes if not closely monitored and treated.
8. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia is likely multifactorial, and he is at risk for further cardiac complications if not closely monitored and treated."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

1. The patient is a 46-year-old male with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who has undergone recent chemotherapy.
2. The patient has a history of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and mild upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB).
3. The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, with progressive right atelectasis and respiratory distress.
4. The patient has evidence of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on computed tomography (CT) scan.
5. The patient is at risk for thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy and is being monitored for platelet count.
6. The patient has acute renal failure, which has improved with volume repletion, and is being monitored for urine output and creatinine levels.
7. The patient has a recent history of schizophrenia and is being treated with haloperidol (Haldol) for delirium.
8. The patient is receiving nutrition support through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has a code status of full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen, leading to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis.
2. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's acute PE may lead to further respiratory compromise, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count may continue to decline, increasing the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidney function may worsen, leading to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and end-stage renal disease.
5. Sepsis: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of indwelling lines may increase the risk of sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's tachycardia and potential pericardial involvement by lung cancer may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of UGIB and continued use of anticoagulation may increase the risk of further bleeding complications.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent and manage these potential complications."
