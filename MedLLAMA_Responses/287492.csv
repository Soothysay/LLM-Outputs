You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour old ICU admission with a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. They were started on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in the morning but were weaned off by 11:00 AM. They have been receiving antibiotics, and blood, urine, and nasal swab cultures were sent. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 115/53 mmHg. They are receiving oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula and are on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, and their oxygen saturation is 95%.

Physical examination reveals a cooperative patient with warm, dry skin and no signs of distress. The lungs are clear, and the patient is able to complete full sentences without difficulty. The patient has a history of COPD, bronchitis, and emphysema.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 19.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.8 g/dL, and platelet count of 205 K/uL. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 36 mg/dL, and their creatinine is 1.2 mg/dL. The patient's glucose level is 147 mg/dL, and their lactate level is 1.6 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD with acute exacerbation puts them at risk for respiratory failure, which could worsen their condition.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms and lab results suggest the possibility of pneumonia, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's high white blood cell count and lactate level suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and death.
4. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's atrial fibrillation and tachycardia put them at risk for cardiovascular instability, which could lead to cardiac arrest.
5. Infection: The patient's presence in the ICU and their underlying medical conditions make them susceptible to infection, which could worsen their condition.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to eat and their underlying medical conditions put them at risk for nutritional deficiencies, which could worsen their condition.
7. Medication errors: The patient's complex medical condition and multiple medications make them susceptible to medication errors, which could worsen their condition."

 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   A/P: 83 y/o male with A-fib, CAD, HTN, and COPD (on intermittent oxygen
   at home) who presented to the ED with 2 days of worsening SOB, admitted
   for COPD exacerbation on prednisone burst but now with increasing WOB
   and A. Fib with RVR.
   .
   # Acute respiratory distress: Hemodynamics would suggest pulmonary
   edema but no overt evidence of volume overload by CXR.  History and
   exam more c/w COPD flare given wheezing, limited air movement and chest
   x-ray but no reported change in sputum production or increased cough.
   Patient has limited reserve with FEV1 40% of predicted and in setting
   of pneumonia may decompensate.  PE unlikely given INR.  No e/o
   aspiration by history or CXR.
   - Trial of CPAP now and repeat ABG on CPAP
   - Steroid burst today with solumedrol 100mg IV x1, redose PRN with plan
   for prednisone 60mg to start in the AM.
   - continue levaquin
   - check CE's, ECG, BNP
   - standing levalbuterol nebulizers, tiotropium
   - increase flutic/salmeterol PRN
   - sputum culture
   - continue vitamin D, calcium
   - consider sending viral screen
   .
   # Afib: A. Fib with RVR.  Appears to be secondary process in setting of
   acute respiratory distress.  Will undergo trial of cpap and if HR does
   not improve will attempt diltiazem gtt.
   - continue rate control with CCB, dilt gtt prn
   - cotninue anticoagulation with coumadin
   - unclear if patient needs full dose aspirin and therapeutic warfarin.
   - hold coumadin dose 1x now for supratherapeutic INR
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Pan culture.  Likely [**1-9**] to steroids but in setting of
   decompensation would eval for occult infection.
   .
   # CAD/hypercholesterolemia: No chest pain or other clinical history to
   suggets active ischemia. EKG with no e/o ischemia
   - continue home meds
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   .
   # HTN:

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and atrial fibrillation (A-fib). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute exacerbation of COPD. He has been treated with non-invasive ventilation, antibiotics, and steroids. His current condition is characterized by increased work of breathing (WOB), atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (RVR), and marked decreased breath sounds throughout all lung fields.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition is at risk of decompensation, which may lead to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his oxygenation and ventilation is necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's lung fields are markedly decreased, which may indicate the presence of pneumonia. Further investigation, such as chest computed tomography (CT) scan or bronchoscopy, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with RVR may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or heart failure. Close monitoring of his cardiac status is necessary.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate the presence of an occult infection. Further investigation, such as blood cultures and urinalysis, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
5. Volume Overload: The patient's hemodynamics suggest pulmonary edema, but no overt evidence of volume overload is present on chest X-ray. Close monitoring of his fluid balance is necessary to prevent volume overload.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or malnutrition.
7. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's chronic illness and decreased oral intake may lead to nutritional deficiencies, such as protein-energy malnutrition or vitamin deficiencies.

Recommendations:

1. Continue non-invasive ventilation and close monitoring of the patient's oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Perform a chest CT scan or bronchoscopy to confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia.
3. Continue antibiotic therapy and adjust as necessary based on the results of cultures.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and adjust his medication regimen as necessary.
5. Perform regular blood cultures and urinalysis to monitor for occult infection.
6. Monitor the patient's fluid balance closely to prevent volume overload.
7. Consider gastrostomy tube placement to provide nutritional support.
8. Provide vitamin and mineral supplements as necessary to prevent nutritional deficiencies."

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, HTN, and A-fib, admitted to the ICU for worsening SOB and acute respiratory distress. He was transferred from the floor due to increased WOB, tachycardia, and A-fib with RVR. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with SOB, tachycardia, and hypertension. He was started on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) but had to be stopped due to inadequate improvement. He is currently on CPAP and oxygen therapy. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, and he is being treated for suspected pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening SOB, tachycardia, and hypertension suggest the possibility of ARDS, which could be exacerbated by his COPD and pneumonia.
2. Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema: The patient's A-fib with RVR and increased HR and BP may indicate cardiogenic pulmonary edema, which could worsen his respiratory distress.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's leukocytosis and suspected pneumonia may lead to further respiratory deterioration and potential complications such as sepsis or respiratory failure.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection, which could worsen his condition if left untreated.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may exacerbate his respiratory distress and increase his risk of cardiovascular complications.
6. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's A-fib may worsen his respiratory distress and increase his risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or stroke.
7. Pneumothorax: The patient's respiratory distress and worsening SOB may indicate a potential pneumothorax, which could worsen his respiratory function.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue monitoring his respiratory status, cardiovascular function, and laboratory results closely. Further treatment and management should be tailored to address the patient's specific needs and prevent potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 83 y/o male with A-fib, CAD, HTN, and COPD (on intermittent oxygen
   at home) who presented to the ED with 2 days of worsening SOB, admitted
   for COPD exacerbation on prednisone burst. Transferred to ICU due
   increased WOB, tachycardia and A fib with RVR.
   .
   # Acute respiratory distress: Hemodynamics would suggest pulmonary
   edema but no overt evidence of volume overload by CXR.  [**Month (only) 60**] be
   exacerbation of COPD although could also be cardiogenic in nature as
   episodes of SOB correspond with increased HR and BP. Patient has
   limited reserve with FEV1 40% of predicted and in setting of pneumonia
   may decompensate.  PE unlikely given INR.  No e/o aspiration by history
   or CXR. Another episode of acute on chronic SOB this morning. Per floor
   team who knew him well prior to transfer to ICU, pt tends to become
   more dyspneic in mornings and actually uses O2 at home only in the
   mornings. A fib with RVR may be precipitating these acute episodes and
   perpetuating symptoms.
   - Dilt 10 mg IV now, and start 30 mg QID, then titrate up as tolerated
   (Pt on 240mg Qdaily at home)
   - Levalbuterol already given, pt reports no benefit.
   - CXR now
   - CPAP trial, repeat ABG; wean off as tolerated. If pt requires CPAP
   again, would place an A-line for closer monitoring and frequent ABG
   checks.
   - Continue prednisone 60mg, levaquin
   - check CE's this am (1^st set neg)
   - standing levalbuterol nebulizers, tiotropium
   - continue flutic/salmeterol PRN
   - sputum culture to be sent if pt produces sputum
   - continue vitamin D, calcium
   - check urine legionella antigen
   .
   # Afib: A. Fib with RVR.  Appears to be secondary process in setting of
   acute respiratory distress or actually the precipitating factor causing
   SOB.
   - continue rate control with CCB, dilt gtt prn
   - continue anticoagulation with coumadin (INR supra-therapeutic at 3.9;
   doses x  2 held so far and will also hold tonight
s dose)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Pan cultured.  Likely [**1-9**] to steroids but in setting of
   decompensation would eval for occult infection. f/u results
   .
   # CAD/hypercholesterolemia: No chest pain or other clinical history to
   suggests active ischemia. EKG with no e/o ischemia
   - continue home meds
   - f/u 2^nd set of cardiac enzymes today
   .
   # HTN:
   - continue home meds  (uptitrate dilt as above, continue lisinopril)
   .
   # Increased BUN:Cr ratio: Likely due to dehydration and steroid

Summary:

The patient, an 83-year-old male, is admitted to the ICU with worsening shortness of breath (SOB) and acute respiratory distress. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), and atrial fibrillation (A-fib). He presented to the emergency department with 2 days of worsening SOB and was admitted for COPD exacerbation. He was transferred to the ICU due to increased work of breathing, tachycardia, and A-fib with respiratory failure.

The patient's condition has deteriorated since this morning, with increasing SOB, tachycardia, and hypertension. He is unable to speak more than a few words at a time due to SOB. He has limited reserve with a forced expiratory volume (FEV1) of 40% of predicted, and in the setting of pneumonia, he may decompensate.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening SOB, tachycardia, and hypertension suggest pulmonary edema, which could be exacerbated by his COPD and pneumonia.
2. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient's A-fib with RVR may be precipitating these acute episodes and perpetuating symptoms.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest pneumonia, which could worsen his respiratory distress.
4. Dehydration: The patient's increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) ratio suggest dehydration, which could exacerbate his respiratory distress.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and pan-culture results suggest an occult infection, which could worsen his condition.

Plan:

1. Continue prednisone and levaquin for COPD exacerbation and pneumonia.
2. Start diltiazem for rate control of A-fib.
3. Continue anticoagulation with coumadin, but hold doses for the next 24 hours.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and adjust medication as necessary.
5. Consider placement of an arterial line for closer monitoring and frequent blood gas checks.
6. Continue stress ulcer prophylaxis and monitor for signs of bleeding.
7. Monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust insulin as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust therapy as necessary.
9. Consider placement of a Foley catheter to monitor urine output.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust therapy as necessary."

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. They have been successfully weaned off CPAP and are currently on nasal cannula oxygen with saturations of 94-95%. The patient continues to experience shortness of breath and is comfortable with Ativan 0.5mg x2. Echocardiogram results show a left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 55%, a cardiac index greater than 2.5, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation. Cardiac enzymes are negative, and urine Legionella antigen is also negative.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 71 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 126/57 mmHg. Respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.43, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 42 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 215 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 19.2 K/uL and a decreased hemoglobin level of 36.0 g/dL. The patient's platelet count is 205 K/uL, and creatinine level is 1.2 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T level is less than 0.01 ng/mL, and lactate level is 1.2 mmol/L.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation may lead to respiratory failure, which could worsen their condition.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation may increase their risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and decreased hemoglobin level may indicate an underlying infection, which could lead to sepsis.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be adequate, increasing their risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Venous thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's immobility and chronic disease may increase their risk of VTE, which could lead to pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis.
6. Malnutrition: The patient's altered nutrition and decreased caloric intake may lead to malnutrition, which could worsen their overall condition.
7. Infection: The patient's chronic disease and immobility may increase their risk of infection, which could lead to sepsis or other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour progress note in the ICU with ongoing management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. The patient has been successfully weaned off CPAP and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen with SpO2 levels of 94-95%. The patient is still experiencing shortness of breath, but is more comfortable with the use of ativan 0.5mg x2. Cardiac enzymes are negative, and urine legionella Ag is negative. The patient has mild-moderate mitral regurgitation, mild pulmonary artery hypertension, and mildly dilated right ventricle on echocardiogram.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory distress and decreased lung sounds may indicate a risk of respiratory failure, particularly with the presence of COPD and acute exacerbation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation and mild-moderate mitral regurgitation may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or stroke.
3. Sepsis: The patient's temperature of 36.4Â°C (97.6Â°F) may indicate a risk of sepsis, particularly with the presence of respiratory failure and potential bacterial colonization.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobilization and presence of DVT prophylaxis may increase the risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's alteration in nutrition and potential malnutrition may increase the risk of complications, such as wound healing delays, infections, or prolonged hospitalization.
6. Glycemic control: The patient's glucose levels of 147 mg/dL may indicate a risk of hyperglycemia, particularly with the presence of stress and potential insulin resistance.
7. VAP: The patient's presence of VAP prophylaxis may indicate a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, particularly with the presence of respiratory failure and potential bacterial colonization."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following summary is provided:

The patient, an 83-year-old male with a history of A-fib, CAD, HTN, and COPD, was admitted to the ICU for worsening SOB and A-fib with RVR. He was initially on CPAP, but was successfully weaned off overnight. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 126/57 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula O2. His respiratory support includes a nasal cannula with 40% FiO2, and he is receiving levaquin, prednisone, and other medications.

The patient's physical examination reveals marked decreased breath sounds throughout all lung fields, no wheezes or rhonchi, and a regular irregular rhythm with a rate of 71 bpm. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Acute respiratory distress: The patient has limited reserve with FEV1 40% of predicted and may decompensate in the setting of pneumonia.
* Afib: The patient has A-fib with RVR, which appears to be secondary to acute respiratory distress. A trial of CPAP and diltiazem may be attempted if the patient's heart rate does not improve.
* Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely secondary to steroids, but in the setting of decompensation, occult infection should be evaluated.
* CAD/hypercholesterolemia: The patient's cardiac enzymes are negative, and there is no clinical history or EKG evidence of active ischemia.
* HTN: The patient's blood pressure is controlled, and he is continuing his home medications.
* BPH: The patient is continuing his outpatient medications and has a foley catheter in place.
* FEN: The patient is advised to follow a cardiac healthy diet.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress and COPD exacerbation increase his risk of respiratory failure.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's A-fib with RVR may worsen or lead to other cardiac arrhythmias.
* Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated creatinine levels increase his risk of infection, particularly in the setting of pneumonia.
* Ischemia: The patient's CAD and hypercholesterolemia increase his risk of ischemia, particularly if his cardiac enzymes become positive.
* Hypertension: The patient's HTN may worsen if his blood pressure is not controlled.
* Bacterial pneumonia: The patient's COPD exacerbation and pneumonia increase his risk of bacterial pneumonia.

The patient's plan should focus on managing his acute respiratory distress, A-fib, and potential infections, while also addressing his underlying conditions and preventing complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y/o male with A-fib, CAD, HTN, and COPD (on intermittent oxygen at
   home) who presented to the ED with 2 days of worsening SOB, admitted
   for COPD exacerbation on prednisone burst but now with increasing WOB
   and A. Fib with RVR.
   .
   # Acute respiratory distress: Hemodynamics would suggest pulmonary
   edema but no overt evidence of volume overload by CXR.  History and
   exam more c/w COPD flare given wheezing, limited air movement and chest
   x-ray but no reported change in sputum production or increased cough.
   Patient has limited reserve with FEV1 40% of predicted and in setting
   of pneumonia may decompensate.  PE unlikely given INR.  No e/o
   aspiration by history or CXR. Able to subjectively feel better with
   trial of CPAP and anxiolytic.
   - Weaned off CPAP overnight with morphine and lorazepam for agitation
   - Cont prednisone 60mg, but due to recent rebound after steroid taper,
   will provide another slow taper, instead of burst
   - continue levaquin, short course (5 days total) for low suspicion of
   serious infection
   - standing levalbuterol nebulizers, tiotropium
   - increase flutic/salmeterol PRN
   - continue vitamin D, calcium carbonate
   - Notify Pulm c/s service and Pulmonologist (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 593**]) to make
   aware of patient
s likely worsening of severe COPD
   .
   # Afib: A. Fib with RVR.  Appears to be secondary process in setting of
   acute respiratory distress. Improved with benzo and morphine.
   - Continue rate control with CCB, dilt gtt transitioned to po dilt 60mg
   [**Name (NI) 8372**]
   - Unclear if patient needs full dose aspirin and therapeutic warfarin.
   - Cont to hold coumadin dose for supratherapeutic INR (3.9)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Pan culture.  Likely [**1-9**] to steroids but in setting of
   decompensation would eval for occult infection.
   - Bld / U Cx neg to date ([**2-14**])
   .
   # CAD/hypercholesterolemia: No chest pain or other clinical history to
   suggests active ischemia. EKG with no e/o ischemia
   - continue home meds
   - Cardiac enzymes neg x2

Summary:

The patient is an 83-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress, atrial fibrillation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. He was previously treated with CPAP and has been weaned off it overnight. He is still experiencing shortness of breath and is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula. His cardiac enzymes are negative, and an echocardiogram showed no signs of left atrial mass or thrombus. His urine legionella Ag test was negative.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, and blood pressure of 126/57 mmHg. He is receiving fluid support and has a fluid balance of -150 mL over the past 24 hours. His respiratory support includes oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's physical examination reveals a warm and dry skin, normal neurologic examination, and no signs of edema or cyanosis. His lung examination shows markedly decreased breath sounds throughout all lung fields, scattered wheezes in the upper fields, and dry crackles in the bilateral bases.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 19.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 205 K/uL. His liver enzymes are elevated, with a creatine kinase of 73 U/L and a lactate dehydrogenase of 1.2 mmol/L.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and wheezing may be indicative of pneumonia. Further evaluation with a chest X-ray and sputum culture may be necessary.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his oxygen saturation and respiratory rate is necessary.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may worsen, leading to cardiac complications such as heart failure or stroke. Close monitoring of his cardiac rhythm and blood pressure is necessary.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and elevated liver enzymes may indicate an underlying infection. Further evaluation with a blood culture and urine culture may be necessary.
5. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD exacerbation may worsen, leading to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his oxygen saturation and respiratory rate is necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.
2. Monitor the patient's vital signs and respiratory rate closely.
3. Consider further evaluation with a chest X-ray and sputum culture to rule out pneumonia.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and blood pressure closely to detect any cardiac complications.
5. Consider further evaluation with a blood culture and urine culture to rule out infection.
6. Continue steroid therapy to manage the patient's COPD exacerbation.
7. Consider referral to a pulmonologist for further management of the patient's COPD exacerbation."
