   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 66 yo man with history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to
   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO.
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - F/u LENIs to eval for DVT though would be quite difficult to
   anticoagulate (recent GIB and h/o hemoptysis).  If LENIs negative, will
   stop workup given issues with CTA.  If LENIs possible, will discuss
   filter placement vs anticoagulation.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - Consider diuresis if CXR wet, though appears dry on exam.
   - ABG [**9-2**] (7.52/30/69/25/1) showed alkalosis.
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - Decrease FiO2 as able
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, will discuss long-term plan of care with
   Neurosurgery today
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past.  3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - followup path.
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. Now at end 10 day course.
   -          Will continue course for now given hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Added vanc/cipro yesterday, will d/c cipro today, f/u cx and
   readdress Vanc pending results
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - Will culture as above.
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Current transfer meds do not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -Continue Synthroid at home dosing; will look into dosing of
   levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not reordered in
   transfer orders).

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung. He has been admitted to the ICU for Afib with RVR, which has been managed with amiodarone and metoprolol. The patient has also had a history of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Current issues:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient requires 100% FiO2 to maintain oxygen saturation in the mid-90s.
2. Infiltrate on CXR: The CXR shows a possible infiltrate, which may be due to pneumonia or an effusion.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid medication has been held since transfer, and it is unclear how long he has been off medication.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been recovering from a nadir of 38,000/L.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient has a stable white blood cell count in the 10,000 range.
6. Delirium: The patient has a history of delirium that began this admission.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and infiltrate on CXR may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's infiltrate on CXR may be due to pneumonia, which could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
3. Sepsis: The patient's hypoxemia and infiltrate on CXR may be due to sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and death.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's Afib with RVR may lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiogenic shock.
5. Thrombotic complications: The patient's history of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis may lead to further thrombotic complications.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding may lead to further bleeding complications.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may lead to myxedema coma, which could be life-threatening.
8. Delirium: The patient's delirium may lead to further complications such as falls, pressure ulcers, and aspiration.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and adjust FiO2 as needed.
2. Consider diuresis if the CXR shows an infiltrate, but appears dry on exam.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's platelet count and consider transfusion if necessary.
4. Consider restarting thyroid medication and consult with endocrinology.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's white blood cell count and consider culture and sensitivity testing if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's delirium and consider reorientation and Zyprexa as needed.
7. Consider restarting tube feeds via J-tube and monitor the patient's nutrition.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's glycemic control and adjust insulin as needed.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust medications as needed.
10. Consider restarting prophylactic anticoagulation with Lovenox and consult with hematology."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

The patient's medication list includes antibiotics, anticoagulants, and medications for pain management and sedation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an infection. The patient's antibiotic therapy should be continued and monitored for signs of sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%, which may indicate respiratory failure. The patient's mechanical ventilation settings should be adjusted as needed to maintain adequate oxygenation.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's heart rate is 85 beats per minute, which may indicate cardiac arrest. The patient's cardiac rhythm should be monitored closely, and any changes in rhythm should be reported to the medical team immediately.
4. Infection: The patient's antibiotic therapy should be continued and monitored for signs of infection.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance is positive, which may indicate fluid overload. The patient's fluid intake and output should be closely monitored, and any changes in fluid balance should be reported to the medical team immediately.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's neurological status should be closely monitored for any signs of neurological complications, such as seizures or decreased level of consciousness.
7. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL, which may indicate renal failure. The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and any changes in renal function should be reported to the medical team immediately.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's ICU care should be continued, with close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and medication therapy. The patient's antibiotic therapy should be continued and monitored for signs of sepsis. The patient's mechanical ventilation settings should be adjusted as needed to maintain adequate oxygenation. The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored, and any changes in fluid balance should be reported to the medical team immediately. The patient's neurological status should be closely monitored for any signs of neurological complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 66 yo man with history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to
   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO.
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - F/u LENIs to eval for DVT though would be quite difficult to
   anticoagulate (recent GIB and h/o hemoptysis).  If LENIs negative, will
   stop workup given issues with CTA.  If LENIs possible, will discuss
   filter placement vs anticoagulation.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - Consider diuresis if CXR wet, though appears dry on exam.
   - ABG [**9-2**] (7.52/30/69/25/1) showed alkalosis.
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - Decrease FiO2 as able
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, will discuss long-term plan of care with
   Neurosurgery today
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past.  3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - followup path.
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. Now at end 10 day course.
   -          Will continue course for now given hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Added vanc/cipro yesterday, will d/c cipro today, f/u cx and
   readdress Vanc pending results
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - Will culture as above.
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Current transfer meds do not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -Continue Synthroid at home dosing; will look into dosing of
   levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not reordered in
   transfer orders).
   #Prophy: Pneumoboots, HSQ, PPI
   #Access: 2 20 gauge peripheral IVs
   #FEN: restart tube feeds via J Tube.
   #Code: FULL
   #Communication: Wife,[**Telephone/Fax (1) 4202**]
   # Dispo: back to NSG if rate controlled in AM.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO.

   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - F/u LENIs to eval for DVT though would be quite difficult to
   anticoagulate (recent GIB and h/o hemoptysis).  If LENIs negative, will
   stop workup given issues with CTA.  If LENIs possible, will discuss
   filter placement vs anticoagulation.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent

   - Consider diuresis if CXR wet, though appears dry on exam.
   - ABG [**9-2**] (7.52/30/69/25/1) showed alkalosis.
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - Decrease FiO2 as able
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, will discuss long-term plan of care with
   Neurosurgery today

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt

   - Pt reports he is thirsty and  appears dry on exam.
   - ABG [**9-2**] (7.52/30/69/25/1) showed alkalosis.
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung, who was recently transferred back to the MICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR). He has a history of intermittent Afib, and is currently being treated with amiodarone and metoprolol. He has also been diagnosed with hypoxemia, requiring increased oxygen support, and is being treated with Atrovent nebs. The patient has a history of PE, DVT, and anticoagulation therapy, and is currently on therapeutic dosing of Lovenox. He has also been diagnosed with Pseudomonas VAP, and is being treated with Zosyn and vancomycin. The patient's platelet count is recovering from a nadir of 38K, and he has been diagnosed with thrombocytopenia. He is also being treated for delirium, and has a history of leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Complications:
	* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR) may lead to cardiac arrest, stroke, or heart failure.
	* Hypothyroidism may exacerbate cardiac symptoms.
2. Respiratory Complications:
	* Hypoxemia may lead to respiratory failure, and may be exacerbated by Pseudomonas VAP.
	* Pulmonary embolism (PE) may lead to respiratory failure.
3. Infectious Complications:
	* Pseudomonas VAP may lead to sepsis, and may be exacerbated by immunosuppression.
	* Urinary tract infections (UTIs) may develop due to indwelling catheters.
4. Hematological Complications:
	* Thrombocytopenia may lead to bleeding complications.
	* Leukocytosis may indicate an underlying infection or inflammation.
5. Neurological Complications:
	* Delirium may be exacerbated by hypothyroidism, and may lead to increased risk of falls, injuries, and infections.
	* Brain metastases may lead to neurological deficits or seizures.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications:
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) may develop due to anticoagulation therapy or underlying cancer.
	* Small bowel obstruction may develop due to tumor involvement.

Overall, the patient is at high risk for cardiac, respiratory, and infectious complications, and requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 66 yo man with history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to
   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO.
   - Episode of a. fib with rapid rates this morning as above, responsive
   to fluid and lopressor
   - Increase amiodarone to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] [**9-3**]
   - Continue metoprolol
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - LENIs negative [**9-2**], pt has iodine contrast allergy and post-op
   hardware, decreasing utility of CTA.  Also has decreased O2
   requirement.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - Pt reports he is thirsty and  appears dry on exam.
   - ABG [**9-2**] (7.52/30/69/25/1) showed alkalosis.
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - FiO2 down to 50% today, continue to monitor
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, will discuss long-term plan of care with
   Neurosurgery today
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past. 3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - followup path- should be available [**9-4**].
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. Now at end 10 day course.
   -          Will continue course for now given hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Added vanc/cipro yesterday, will d/c cipro today, f/u cx and
   readdress Vanc pending results
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   - Will decrease oxycodone to q6 from q4
   # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - Will culture as above.
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Current transfer meds do not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -Continue Synthroid at home dosing; will look into dosing of
   levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not reordered in
   transfer orders).

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung, who has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various complications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on oxygen therapy with a FiO2 of 50% and is requiring more oxygen than previously. He has had episodes of hypoxemia and desaturation to the 80s, which improved after receiving an Atrovent neb.
* Cardiac: The patient has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which is being treated with amiodarone and metoprolol. He has a history of hypertension and is currently on anticoagulation therapy with Lovenox.
* Hemodynamic: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but he has had episodes of hypotension in the past. He has received fluid boluses and has been treated with vasopressors.
* Neurological: The patient has a history of delirium and is currently being treated with reorientation and anti-anxiety medications.
* Gastrointestinal: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is currently being treated with proton pump inhibitors and anticoagulation therapy.
* Infectious: The patient has a history of Pseudomonas VAP and is currently being treated with antibiotics.
* Endocrine: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is currently being treated with Synthroid.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen requirements are increasing, and he may require more aggressive respiratory support.
* Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to cardiac arrest or other cardiac complications.
* Sepsis: The patient's history of Pseudomonas VAP and other infections may lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
* Bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and anticoagulation therapy may lead to bleeding complications.
* Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is recovering from a nadir of 38K, and he may be at risk for bleeding complications.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's current treatment for hypothyroidism is unclear, and he may be at risk for complications related to untreated hypothyroidism.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 66 yo man with history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to
   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO.
   - Episode of a. fib with rapid rates this morning as above, responsive
   to fluid and lopressor
   - Increase amiodarone to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] [**9-3**]
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - LENIs negative [**9-2**], pt has iodine contrast allergy and post-op
   hardware, decreasing utility of CTA.  Also has decreased O2
   requirement.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - Pt reports he is thirsty and appears dry on exam.
   - ABG [**9-2**] (7.52/30/69/25/1) showed alkalosis.
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - FiO2 down to 50% today, continue to monitor
   - BNP 1249 down from 1727
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, will discuss long-term plan of care with
   Neurosurgery today
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past. 3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - followup path- should be available [**9-4**].
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. [**9-2**] end 10 day course.
   -          Continued Zosyn for now given hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Will plan on Zosyn through [**9-6**] for 14 day course
   -          Added vanc/cipro yesterday, will d/c cipro [**9-2**]
   -          Sputum from [**9-1**] showing only sparse GNRs as of [**9-3**]; will
   d/c  Vanc and can restart  if cultures change
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   - Will decrease oxycodone to q6 from q4
   # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - Will culture as above.
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Current transfer meds do not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -          Initially continued Synthroid at home dosing; will look into
   dosing of levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not reordered
   in transfer orders).
   -          Now changed to 100 mg IV daily to ensure consistent dosing
   #Prophy: Pneumoboots, HSQ, PPI
   #Access: 2 20 gauge peripheral IVs
   #FEN: Continue feeds via J Tube.  Had speech/swallow [**9-3**], difficult to
   assess safety, written for video on [**9-5**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung. He was admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR) and has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hemoptysis. He has undergone palliative decompression and fusion surgery and is currently receiving anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's recent events include:

* Ultrasound (US) on [**2160-9-2**] showed no effusion, and his electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm.
* He received 10 IV diltiazem and 10 IV lopressor for rate control, but his blood pressure (BP) remained unresponsive.
* He was given a 500cc bolus of fluid, which stabilized his BP.
* His oxygen saturation (SpO2) improved from 80% to 96% after receiving Atrovent nebulization.
* His B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level decreased from 1727 to 1249.
* He was given 100mg IV Synthroid for thyroid replacement.
* He was also given Cipro and Vancomycin for infection, but Cipro was discontinued due to the patient's iodine contrast allergy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen requirements have increased, and he is currently on 50% FiO2. He may require further increases in oxygen therapy.
2. Pseudomonas VAP: The patient has a history of Pseudomonas in his sputum and is currently receiving Zosyn for infection. He may require further treatment for VAP.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been decreasing, and he may require further monitoring and treatment.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is stable, but he may require further culture and treatment for infection.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid function is currently being replaced with IV Synthroid, but he may require further monitoring and treatment.
6. Delirium: The patient has a history of delirium and may require further treatment and monitoring.
7. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient has a history of bleeding and may require further monitoring and treatment.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen requirements and adjust therapy as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's Pseudomonas VAP with Zosyn and consider further treatment options.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider further treatment options if necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's white blood cell count and consider further culture and treatment options if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's thyroid function and adjust therapy as needed.
6. Continue to treat the patient's delirium with reorientation and Zyprexa as needed.
7. Monitor the patient's hemorrhagic complications and adjust therapy as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
 A/P: 66 yo man with history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to
   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO.
   - Episode of a. fib with rapid rates this morning as above, responsive
   to fluid and lopressor
   - Increase amiodarone to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] [**9-3**]
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - LENIs negative [**9-2**], pt has iodine contrast allergy and post-op
   hardware, decreasing utility of CTA.  Also has decreased O2
   requirement.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - Pt reports he is thirsty and appears dry on exam.
   - ABG [**9-2**] (7.52/30/69/25/1) showed alkalosis.
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - FiO2 down to 50% today, continue to monitor
   - BNP 1249 down from 1727
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, will discuss long-term plan of care with
   Neurosurgery today
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past. 3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - followup path- should be available [**9-4**].
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. [**9-2**] end 10 day course.
   -          Continued Zosyn for now given hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Will plan on Zosyn through [**9-6**] for 14 day course
   -          Added vanc/cipro yesterday, will d/c cipro [**9-2**]
   -          Sputum from [**9-1**] showing only sparse GNRs as of [**9-3**]; will
   d/c  Vanc and can restart  if cultures change
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   - Will decrease oxycodone to q6 from q4
   # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - Will culture as above.
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Current transfer meds do not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -          Initially continued Synthroid at home dosing; will look into
   dosing of levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not reordered
   in transfer orders).
   -          Now changed to 100 mg IV daily to ensure consistent dosing
   #Prophy: Pneumoboots, HSQ, PPI
   #Access: 2 20 gauge peripheral IVs
   #FEN: Continue feeds via J Tube.  Had speech/swallow [**9-3**], difficult to
   assess safety, written for video on [**9-5**].

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung, who has undergone palliative decompression and fusion of T1-T12. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times for various complications, including bradycardic-bradypneic pulseless electrical activity (BRBPR) and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR).

Current issues:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's Afib with RVR is being treated with amiodarone, metoprolol, and esmolol. His heart rate is responsive to fluid and lopressor.
2. Hypoxemia: The patient requires more oxygen than previously, with a requirement of 70-100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). He has a CXR showing possible infiltrate or small amount of effusion.
3. Infection workup: The patient has Pseudomonas aeruginosa in his sputum and has been on Zosyn for 10 days. He has also been started on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. Cultures are pending.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is stable in the 10,000 range.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is recovering from a nadir of 38,000 to 89,000, with a current count of 59,000.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and has been off levothyroxine since transfer. He is currently receiving 100 mg IV daily.
7. Pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has Pseudomonas VAP, which is being treated with Zosyn.
8. Delirium: The patient has a history of delirium and is being treated with reorientation, Zyprexa, and decreased oxycodone dosing.
9. Lung metastases: The patient has known lung metastases and has a history of hemoptysis.
10. History of pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of PE and is currently on anticoagulation therapy.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and possible infiltrate or effusion on CXR may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's infection workup and leukocytosis may indicate sepsis.
3. Bleeding: The patient's thrombocytopenia and history of PE may increase his risk of bleeding.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to cardiac arrhythmias.
5. Thyroid storm: The patient's hypothyroidism and history of papillary thyroid cancer may increase his risk of thyroid storm.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's Pseudomonas VAP may lead to pneumonia.
7. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen and lead to increased agitation and other complications.
8. Hemoptysis: The patient's lung metastases and history of hemoptysis may lead to hemoptysis.
9. PE: The patient's history of PE and anticoagulation therapy may increase his risk of PE.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen requirements and adjust FiO2 as needed.
2. Complete the infection workup and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.
3. Monitor the patient's platelet count and adjust anticoagulation therapy if necessary.
4. Continue thyroid hormone replacement therapy and monitor the patient's thyroid function.
5. Consider a pulmonary embolism workup, given the patient's history of PE.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust therapy as needed.
7. Consider a video swallow evaluation to assess the patient's safety for oral feeding.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's delirium and adjust therapy as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
 A/P: 66 yo man with history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to
   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO. [**9-3**]
   episode of  a. fib with rapid rates, responsive to fluid and lopressor
   - No recurrence of a fib in 24 hrs, continue to monitor
   - Continue amiodarone at 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] ([**9-3**])
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - LENIs negative [**9-2**], pt has iodine contrast allergy and post-op
   hardware, decreasing utility of CTA.  Also has decreased O2
   requirement.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.  O2 requirement decreased to 50% TM on [**9-3**]
   - Now ranging from 50-70% FiO2 trach mask, stable
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - I/O even
   - continue to monitor, atrovent nebs as needed
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - BNP 1249 ([**9-3**]) down from 1727
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, planning on d/c to rehab in next several
   days
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past. 3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - Path showed no malignancy, but acute and chronic inflammation
   consistent with ulcer
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. [**9-2**] end 10 day course.
   -          Continued Zosyn on readmission to MICU given
   hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Has now received 13 days of Zosyn, will d/c as no continued
   signs of infection.
   -          Sputum from [**9-1**] showing only sparse GNRs as of [**9-3**]; d/c
     Vanc as no change in cultures after 48 hrs
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Seems improved over last 2 days, though still occasionally confused
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   - Will decrease oxycodone to q6 from q4
    # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - F/u pending cx
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Meds on transfer did not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -                 Initially continued Synthroid at home dosing; will
   look into dosing of levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not
   reordered in transfer orders).  Given 100 mg IV daily to ensure
   consistent dosing.
   -                 Changed to 200 mcg daily on [**9-4**] given anticipated

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

   Assessment and Plan
 A/P: 66 yo man with history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to
   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO. [**9-3**]
   episode of  a. fib with rapid rates, responsive to fluid and lopressor
   - No recurrence of a fib in 24 hrs, continue to monitor
   - Continue amiodarone at 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] ([**9-3**])
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - LENIs negative [**9-2**], pt has iodine contrast allergy and post-op
   hardware, decreasing utility of CTA.  Also has decreased O2
   requirement.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.  O2 requirement decreased to 50% TM on [**9-3**]
   - Now ranging from 50-70% FiO2 trach mask, stable
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - I/O even
   - continue to monitor, atrovent nebs as needed
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - BNP 1249 ([**9-3**]) down from 1727
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, planning on d/c to rehab in next several
   days
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past. 3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - Path showed no malignancy, but acute and chronic inflammation
   consistent with ulcer
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. [**9-2**] end 10 day course.
   -          Continued Zosyn on readmission to MICU given
   hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Has now received 13 days of Zosyn, will d/c as no continued
   signs of infection.
   -          Sputum from [**9-1**] showing only sparse GNRs as of [**9-3**]; d/c
     Vanc as no change in cultures after 48 hrs
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Seems improved over last 2 days, though still occasionally confused
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   - Will decrease oxycodone to q6 from q4
    # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - F/u pending cx
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Meds on transfer did not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -                 Initially continued Synthroid at home dosing; will
   look into dosing of levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not
   reordered in transfer orders).  Given 100 mg IV daily to ensure
   consistent dosing.
   -                 Changed to 200 mcg daily on [**9-4**] given anticipated
   discharge to rehab
   #Prophy: Pneumoboots, HSQ, PPI
   #Access: 2 20 gauge peripheral IVs
   #FEN: Continue feeds via J Tube.  Had speech/swallow [**9-3**], difficult to
   assess safety, written for video on [**9-5**].  Increased tube feeds to
   Beneprotein at 70 mL/hr.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen requirement has increased, and they are requiring more oxygen than previously. This may indicate a worsening of their respiratory status.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of Pseudomonas VAP and has received 13 days of Zosyn. They have also had a recent episode of LGIB. Further infection workup is needed to determine if there are any ongoing infections.
3. Delirium: The patient has a history of delirium, and although they seem improved, they are still occasionally confused. Monitoring for delirium and adjusting medication as needed is important.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is recovering, but it is unclear if the thrombocytopenia was medication-related. Monitoring for bleeding and adjusting medication as needed is important.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid medication was not continued during their recent transfer, and they have been experiencing symptoms. Reinitiating thyroid replacement therapy is important.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is stable, but further workup is needed to determine the cause of the leukocytosis.
7. Pseudomonas VAP: The patient has had a recent episode of Pseudomonas VAP, and further monitoring is needed to ensure that the infection has resolved.
8. LGIB: The patient has had a recent episode of LGIB, and further monitoring is needed to determine if there are any ongoing bleeding issues.
9. Thrombosis: The patient has a history of DVT/PE and is at risk for thrombotic events. Monitoring for thrombosis and adjusting anticoagulation therapy as needed is important.
10. Metastatic papillary CA: The patient has a history of metastatic papillary CA, and further monitoring is needed to determine if there are any signs of disease progression.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's oxygen requirement and adjust therapy as needed.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's infection workup and adjust antibiotic therapy as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's delirium and adjust medication as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's thrombocytopenia and adjust medication as needed.
5. Reinitiate thyroid replacement therapy and monitor the patient's thyroid function.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's leukocytosis and adjust therapy as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's Pseudomonas VAP and adjust antibiotic therapy as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's LGIB and adjust therapy as needed.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's thrombosis and adjust anticoagulation therapy as needed.
10. Continue to monitor the patient's metastatic papillary CA and adjust therapy as needed.

The patient's plan of care should be discussed with the multidisciplinary team, including the neurosurgeon, pulmonologist, and infectious disease specialist, to ensure that all aspects of the patient's care are being addressed."

   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO. [**9-3**]
   episode of  a. fib with rapid rates, responsive to fluid and lopressor
   - No recurrence of a fib in 24 hrs, continue to monitor
   - Continue amiodarone at 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] ([**9-3**])
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - LENIs negative [**9-2**], pt has iodine contrast allergy and post-op
   hardware, decreasing utility of CTA.  Also has decreased O2
   requirement.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.  O2 requirement decreased to 50% TM on [**9-3**]
   - Now ranging from 50-70% FiO2 trach mask, stable
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - I/O even
   - continue to monitor, atrovent nebs as needed
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - BNP 1249 ([**9-3**]) down from 1727
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, planning on d/c to rehab in next several
   days
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past. 3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - Path showed no malignancy, but acute and chronic inflammation
   consistent with ulcer
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. [**9-2**] end 10 day course.
   -          Continued Zosyn on readmission to MICU given
   hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Has now received 13 days of Zosyn, will d/c as no continued
   signs of infection.
   -          Sputum from [**9-1**] showing only sparse GNRs as of [**9-3**];
   d/c
d   Vanc as no change in cultures after 48 hrs
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Seems improved over last 2 days, though still occasionally confused
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   - Will decrease oxycodone to q6 from q4
    # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - F/u pending cx
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Meds on transfer did not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -                 Initially continued Synthroid at home dosing; will
   look into dosing of levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not
   reordered in transfer orders).  Given 100 mg IV daily to ensure
   consistent dosing.
   -                 Changed to 200 mcg daily on [**9-4**] given anticipated
   discharge to rehab
   #Prophy: Pneumoboots, HSQ, PPI

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung, who has been admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). The patient has a complex medical history, including recent palliative decompression and fusion of T1-T12, known brain, bone, and soft tissue metastases, and a history of pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's current condition is stable, with no recurrence of AFib in the past 24 hours. However, he is still requiring more oxygen than previously, with a requirement of 50-70% FiO2 trach mask. His chest x-ray shows a possible infiltrate, possibly with a small amount of effusion. His blood work shows a mild leukocytosis, stable platelet count, and normal kidney function.

The patient has a history of pseudomonas aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has received 13 days of Zosyn. His sputum cultures have shown sparse Gram-negative rods, and his Vanc has been discontinued. He also has a history of delirium, which has improved over the past two days.

The patient's medications include amiodarone, metoprolol, and lansoprazole, and he is receiving T4 replacement therapy. He has a history of thyroid cancer and is currently hypothyroid.

The patient's plan is to continue monitoring his oxygen requirement, and he will have a video swallow study on [**9-5**]. He will also have a follow-up colonoscopy to assess the ulcers in his colon. His anticoagulation therapy has been held due to his history of PE and hemoptysis, and he will continue to receive prophylactic anticoagulation with Lovenox.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's requirement for oxygen is increasing, and he may be at risk for respiratory failure if his oxygen requirement continues to increase.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of VAP and pseudomonas aeruginosa, and he is still receiving antibiotics. He may be at risk for further infection if his antibiotics are discontinued too soon.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is stable, but he may be at risk for further thrombocytopenia if he develops an infection or bleeding.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of thyroid cancer and is currently hypothyroid. He may be at risk for further hypothyroidism if his T4 replacement therapy is discontinued.
5. Delirium: The patient has a history of delirium, and he may be at risk for further delirium if his oxygen requirement increases or if he develops an infection.
6. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a history of PE, and he may be at risk for further PE if his anticoagulation therapy is discontinued or if he develops a deep vein thrombosis.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but he is at risk for further complications if his oxygen requirement increases or if he develops an infection. Close monitoring and prompt treatment of any complications that arise are necessary to ensure the patient's optimal outcome."
