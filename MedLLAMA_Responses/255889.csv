You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old woman with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 (DM1), and Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). She is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and is being treated with insulin and other medications to manage her DKA. Her abdominal pain has improved, and her altered mental status is improving. Her head CT scan is normal.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. DKA: The patient's DKA is improving, but it is unclear what her home regimen of insulin is, and it may be challenging to achieve a completely normal gap in her renal failure. Regular monitoring of her glucose levels and insulin therapy is crucial to prevent relapse.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is improving, but it is essential to continue monitoring her mental status and adjust her treatment plan as needed.
3. ESRD: The patient's ESRD requires ongoing management, including hemodialysis (HD) per renal.
4. Infections: The patient is at risk for infections due to her ESRD and DKA, and close monitoring of her vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect any potential infections early.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's ESRD and DKA increase her risk for cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension. Regular monitoring of her cardiac status and blood pressure is crucial.
6. Respiratory Complications: The patient's ESRD and DKA increase her risk for respiratory complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Close monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygen saturation is necessary.
7. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and ESRD increase her risk for neurological complications, such as seizures and cerebral edema. Close monitoring of her neurological status and laboratory results is necessary.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's DKA and ESRD increase her risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Close monitoring of her gastrointestinal status and laboratory results is necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 yo F with history of DM1, ESRD on HD presents
   with abdominal pain and found to be in DKA.
   .
   # DKA: Likely due to poor insulin compliance and gastoporesis. No clear
   precipitating event other than noncompliance. No signs of infection
   (CXR normal), lipase normal, serum tox negative, EKG without signs of
   ischemia, and neuro exam normal so unlikely CVA. Diagnosis supported by
   AG of 25, ketonuria, and hyperglycemia (although clasically DKA
   presents with serum glucose 500-800). Started on IV insulin without
   bolus in ED, and sugars improved from 300s to 70s.
   - Anion gap has now closed
   - Insulin gtt and D5 shut off around 5pm [**4-18**]
   - Pt intermittently tolerating PO but continues to complain of GI pain
   and nausea
   - Will continue to follow [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs
   - Lantus 20 units at dinner time
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Carries diagnosis of gastroporesis, which may be
   etiology of this pain, as she did present with nausea and vomiting.
   Responded to dilaudid, ativan and compazine in the ED. Lipase normal.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 yo F with history of DM1, ESRD on HD presents
   with abdominal pain and found to be in DKA.
   .
   # DKA: Likely due to poor insulin compliance and gastoporesis. No clear
   precipitating event other than noncompliance. No signs of infection
   (CXR normal), lipase normal, serum tox negative, EKG without signs of
   ischemia, and neuro exam normal so unlikely CVA. Diagnosis supported by
   AG of 25, ketonuria, and hyperglycemia (although clasically DKA
   presents with serum glucose 500-800). Started on IV insulin without
   bolus in ED, and sugars improved from 300s to 70s.
   - Anion gap has now closed
   - Insulin gtt and D5 shut off around 5pm [**4-18**]
   - Pt intermittently tolerating PO but continues to complain of GI pain
   and nausea
   - Will continue to follow [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). She presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which is likely related to gastroparesis. The patient's anion gap has closed, and her sugars have improved with IV insulin therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Hypoglycemia: Despite the patient's improved glucose levels, she is still at risk for hypoglycemia due to the insulin therapy and her history of DM1.
2. Gastroparesis: The patient's gastroparesis can lead to persistent nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which may worsen her overall condition.
3. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system due to ESRD and her history of non-compliance with medication may increase her risk of infection.
4. Hypertension: The patient's persistent hypertension may lead to complications such as cardiac damage, stroke, and kidney damage.
5. Narcotic withdrawal: The patient's history of non-compliance with medication and her current use of pain medications may lead to narcotic withdrawal symptoms.
6. ESRD progression: The patient's missed HD sessions may lead to further progression of her ESRD, which can increase her risk of complications and mortality.

The patient's social situation, including her history of medication non-compliance and stressful social situation, may also impact her overall health and well-being. A social worker consult is planned to address these issues."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best.

Chief Complaint: abdominal pain
   24 Hour Events:
   Obtained home med list from [**Company **], full list in team census.
   -- Added Pt
s home antihypertensive medications but they were held due
   to persistent nausea. Changes ISS [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 24**] [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs.
   -- 6pm labs...anion gap closed (9). Pt continues to be hypertensive but
   asymptomatic in setting of holding her home BP meds because she is NPO
   due to nausea. Complaining of abdominal pain, but responds well to
   dilaudid and zofran. KUB obtained, poor study but no obvious SBO. Pt
   sleepy throughout night, but then wakes up and asks for dilaudid for
   pain.

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 yo F with history of DM1, ESRD on HD presents
   with abdominal pain and found to be in DKA.
   .
   # DKA: Likely due to poor insulin compliance and gastoporesis. No clear
   precipitating event other than noncompliance. No signs of infection
   (CXR normal), lipase normal, serum tox negative, EKG without signs of
   ischemia, and neuro exam normal so unlikely CVA. Diagnosis supported by
   AG of 25, ketonuria, and hyperglycemia (although clasically DKA
   presents with serum glucose 500-800). Started on IV insulin without
   bolus in ED, and sugars improved from 300s to 70s. Would ideally like
   to start SQ insulin, but will need to confirm SQ dose in AM.
   - Anion gap has now closed
   - Insulin gtt and D5 shut off around 5pm yesterday
   - Pt intermittently tolerating PO but continues to complain of GI pain
   and nausea
   - Will continue to follow [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs
   - Lantus 20 units at dinner time
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Carries diagnosis of gastroporesis, which may be
   etiology of this pain, as she did present with nausea and vomitting.
   Responded to dilaudid, ativan and compazine in the ED. Lipase normal.
   Alk phos elevated, but other LFTs normal. Exam benign.  Overnight, Pt
   appears to be trying to wretch and crying out asking for pain
   medication. Once given, Pt falls asleep immediately.
   - Suspect component of somatization/secondary gain
   - Can consider CT scan of abdomen if concern for acute intraabdominal
   process
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Missed HD since Monday. No urgent need for HD overnight.
   Fistula with palpable thrill in RUE.
   - Pt dialyzed yesterday
   - Will continue to follow renal recs
   - Dialysis scheduled MWF
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt persistently hypertensive/tachycardic
   - On home regimen of clonidine patch, labetolol 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], lisinopril
   5 mg qD
   - Can give 10 mg IV hydralazine PRN for hypertension if Pt markedly
   hypertensive or otherwise symptomatic
   .
   # Social: Pt w/ longstanding hx of medication non-compliance. Also w/
   stressful social situation at baseline
   - SW consult in AM
   ,

   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI

Summary:

The patient is a 28-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). She presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain and was found to be in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient was treated with IV insulin and her sugar levels improved. She continues to experience abdominal pain and nausea, which may be related to gastroparesis. The patient's hypertension is being managed with IV hydralazine and her ESRD is being followed with regular HD sessions.

Potential medical complications:

1. DKA: The patient's DKA has been treated, but she may be at risk for recurrent episodes due to her history of poor insulin compliance and gastroparesis.
2. Gastroparesis: The patient's abdominal pain and nausea may be related to gastroparesis, which can lead to malnutrition, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being managed with IV hydralazine, but she may be at risk for complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, and kidney damage if her blood pressure is not well-controlled.
4. ESRD: The patient's ESRD requires regular HD sessions, which can be associated with complications such as infection, bleeding, and cardiovascular disease.
5. Poor insulin compliance: The patient's history of poor insulin compliance may lead to recurrent episodes of DKA and other complications related to uncontrolled diabetes.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient's history of gastroparesis and nausea may increase her risk for stress ulcers, which can lead to bleeding and other complications.
7. VAP: The patient's history of ESRD and HD may increase her risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can lead to serious complications such as sepsis and death.
8. DVT: The patient's history of ESRD and HD may increase her risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to pulmonary embolism and other complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient, a 24-year-old female, was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain. She was initially treated with antihypertensive medications, but these were held due to persistent nausea. The patient continues to experience abdominal pain, but responds well to dilaudid and zofran. Her lab results show an anion gap that has closed, and she remains hypertensive despite being NPO. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, and blood pressure of 165/107 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, which may lead to end-organ damage if not managed promptly.
2. Nausea and vomiting: The patient's persistent nausea and vomiting may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, particularly potassium and sodium.
3. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain may worsen if not managed effectively, potentially leading to complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, which may increase the risk of complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.
5. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid level may indicate the presence of sepsis, which requires prompt recognition and treatment.
6. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels may indicate acute kidney injury, which requires close monitoring and potential dialysis.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 95%, but her ABG results show a pH of 7.33, which may indicate respiratory failure or inadequate oxygenation.
8. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's heart rate is 108 bpm, which may indicate cardiovascular instability or tachycardia, potentially leading to arrhythmias or cardiac arrest.
9. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's lab results show abnormal electrolyte levels, including potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus, which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 28 yo F with history of DM1, ESRD on HD presents
   with abdominal pain and found to be in DKA.
   .
   # DKA: Likely due to poor insulin compliance and gastoporesis. No clear
   precipitating event other than noncompliance. No signs of infection
   (CXR normal), lipase normal, serum tox negative, EKG without signs of
   ischemia, and neuro exam normal so unlikely CVA. Diagnosis supported by
   AG of 25, ketonuria, and hyperglycemia (although clasically DKA
   presents with serum glucose 500-800). Started on IV insulin without
   bolus in ED, and sugars improved from 300s to 70s. Would ideally like
   to start SQ insulin, but will need to confirm SQ dose in AM.
   - Anion gap has now closed
   - Insulin gtt and D5 shut off around 5pm yesterday
   - Pt intermittently tolerating PO but continues to complain of GI pain
   and nausea
   - Will continue to follow [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs
   - Lantus 20 units at dinner time
   .
   # Abdominal pain: Carries diagnosis of gastroporesis, which may be
   etiology of this pain, as she did present with nausea and vomitting.
   Responded to dilaudid, ativan and compazine in the ED. Lipase normal.
   Alk phos elevated, but other LFTs normal. Exam benign.  Overnight, Pt
   appears to be trying to wretch and crying out asking for pain
   medication. Once given, Pt falls asleep immediately.
   - Suspect component of somatization/secondary gain
   - Can consider CT scan of abdomen if concern for acute intraabdominal
   process
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Missed HD since Monday. No urgent need for HD overnight.
   Fistula with palpable thrill in RUE.
   - Pt dialyzed yesterday
   - Will continue to follow renal recs
   - Dialysis scheduled MWF
   .
   # Hypertension: Pt persistently hypertensive/tachycardic
   - On home regimen of clonidine patch, labetolol 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], lisinopril
   5 mg qD
   - Can give 10 mg IV hydralazine PRN for hypertension if Pt markedly
   hypertensive or otherwise symptomatic
   .
   # Social: Pt w/ longstanding hx of medication non-compliance. Also w/
   stressful social situation at baseline
   - SW consult in AM
   ,
   # FEN: Clear diet, advancing as tolerated
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   # Access: peripheral x1, Femoral triple lumen
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  presumed full
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   (CXR normal), lipase normal, serum tox negative, EKG without signs of
   ischemia, and neuro exam normal so unlikely CVA. Diagnosis supported by
   AG of 25, ketonuria, and hyperglycemia (although clasically DKA
   presents with serum glucose 500-800). Started on IV insulin without
   bolus in ED, and sugars improved from 300s to 70s. Would ideally like
   to start SQ insulin, but will need to confirm SQ dose in AM.
   - Anion gap has now closed
   - Insulin gtt and D5 shut off around 5pm yesterday
   - Pt intermittently tolerating PO but continues to complain of GI pain
   and nausea
   - Will continue to follow [**Last Name (un) 294**] recs
   - Lantus 20 units at dinner time

   # Abdominal pain: Carries diagnosis of gastroporesis, which may be
   etiology of this pain, as she did present with nausea and vomitting.
   Responded to dilaudid, ativan and compazine in the ED. Lipase normal.
   Alk phos elevated, but other LFTs normal. Exam benign.  Overnight, Pt
   appears to be trying to wretch and crying out asking for pain
   medication. Once given, Pt falls asleep immediately.
   - Suspect component of somatization/secondary gain
   - Can consider CT scan of abdomen if concern for acute intraabdominal
   process

   # Hypertension: Pt persistently hypertensive/tachycardic
   - On home regimen of clonidine patch, labetolol 100 mg [**Hospital1 **], lisinopril
   5 mg qD
   - Can give 10 mg IV hydralazine PRN for hypertension if Pt markedly
   hypertensive or otherwise symptomatic

Summary:

The patient, a 28-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain and diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She was treated with IV insulin and her blood sugar levels improved. The patient has been experiencing nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which is thought to be related to gastroparesis. She has also been hypertensive and tachycardic, and is being treated with IV hydralazine as needed.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of gastroparesis: The patient's abdominal pain and nausea may worsen if gastroparesis is not adequately managed.
2. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's persistent hypertension may lead to a hypertensive crisis, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
3. DKA recurrence: The patient's DKA may recur if insulin compliance is not maintained or if there is a precipitating event.
4. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state due to ESRD and DKA makes her more susceptible to infection.
5. Renal complications: The patient's ESRD and missed HD sessions may lead to further renal complications, such as acute kidney injury or uremic syndrome.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia may lead to cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
7. Psychological complications: The patient's stressful social situation and history of medication non-compliance may lead to psychological complications, such as depression or anxiety.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to manage the patient's gastroparesis with anti-emetic medications and consider a CT scan of the abdomen if the pain persists.
2. Monitor the patient's blood pressure closely and treat hypertension with IV hydralazine as needed.
3. Ensure that the patient maintains insulin compliance and adjust the insulin regimen as needed.
4. Consider a social worker consultation to address the patient's stressful social situation and medication non-compliance.
5. Continue to follow the patient's renal and hemodialysis regimen, and consider scheduling HD sessions more frequently if the patient's kidney function worsens.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status closely and consider adjusting the patient's medications to prevent cardiovascular complications.
7. Consider referring the patient to a mental health professional to address any psychological complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 28-year-old woman with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), Diabetes Mellitus Type 1 (DM1), and Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's condition has been managed in the MICU, and the note summarizes her current status.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 150/98 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 95%, and she is receiving no respiratory support.

The patient's physical examination is notable for right lower extremity edema, which is absent. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and her extremities are warm. Neurologically, she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to stimuli.

Laboratory results indicate that the patient's kidney function is severely impaired, with a creatinine level of 11.4 mg/dL. Her glucose levels have been fluctuating, ranging from 59 to 77 mg/dL. Other laboratory values, including electrolyte levels and liver function tests, are within normal limits.

The patient's condition is complicated by several potential medical complications, including:

1. Renal failure, which is likely to progress if not managed appropriately.
2. Altered mental status, which may be due to the patient's underlying medical condition, medication side effects, or other factors.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis, which has been resolved but may require ongoing management.
4. Abdominal pain, which may be related to medication side effects or underlying gastrointestinal issues.
5. Opiate withdrawal, which may be contributing to the patient's abdominal pain.
6. Potential for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis, given the patient's underlying medical condition and the use of heparin and proton pump inhibitors.
7. Risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU.

Based on the patient's condition and potential medical complications, the following plan has been implemented:
