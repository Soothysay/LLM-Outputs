   aflutter who was transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for LUE thrombectomy and a
   flutter with RVR complicated by worsening renal failure,
   rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload and now s/p LUE fasciotomy.
    L brachial thrombus c/b compartment syndrome: S/p thromboembolectomy
   which was c/b compartment syndrome, likely reperfusion injury with no
   necrosis on intraop evaluation seen, now s/p fasciotomy.
   - F/u Plastics and Vascular recs
   - continue heparin gtt
   ARF: Baseline unknown but Cr 1.2 on admission likely represents mild
   ARF given age. Likely prerenal from hypoperfusion with possible
   progression to ATN, complicated by progressive rhabdomyolysis. Cr now
   increased to 2.8 and pt anuric.
   - Given lack of urine output and tenuous respiratory status will
   discontinue fluids
   - Hold duloxetine and gabapentin for now; renally dose all meds
   - Trend Cr and electrolytes
   - Foley in place to monitor urine output
   - Pt's family open to idea of hemodialysis if becomes necessary
   - F/u renal recs
   Rhabdomyolysis:  As above, CKS stabilizing in the range of 40k.  Little
   improvement with bicarbonate.
   - holding fluids for now
   Fluid overload: Pt with increasing O2 requirement in setting of
   aggressive fluid hydration and anuria. [**Month (only) 8**] also be exacerbated by
   aflutter with RVR although rate currently better controlled. No known
   h/o CHF.  CXR without significant worsening thus far.
   - as above, now anuric despite aggressive hydration with bicarbonate
   - will discontinue fluids
   - monitor oxygen saturations
   - okay to intubate
   - would likely favor trial of high dose lasix prior to intubation
   Atrial flutter: H/o a flutter in past, likely in setting of pain or
   acute illness. Earlier required dilt gtt for RVR but HR currently
   better controlled off gtt.
   - Monitor on tele, EKG in AM
   - Cont home metoprolol 50mg [**Hospital1 **], uptitrate prn
   - digoxin level elevated so will discontinue
   - Consider IV dilt if relapses in to RVR
   - Add on TSH
   - F/u cards recs

   - Monitor on tele, EKG in AM
   - Cont ASA 325mg, beta blocker
   - Already on heparin gtt for thrombus
   - echocardiogram this morning
   Altered mental status: Pt with dementia at baseline. No acute findings
   on CT head. Yesterday thought to be somnolent in setting of sedation
   with some improvement after receving Narcan. Now also s/p sedation for
   OR and lethargic. [**Month (only) 8**] also have contribution from acute illness and

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia, CAD, and atrial fibrillation who was admitted to the ICU for a left upper extremity thrombectomy and atrial flutter with right ventricular overload. She has developed acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload, and altered mental status. She has a PICC line in place and is receiving heparin, bicarbonate, and diltiazem infusions. Her vital signs are stable, but her respiratory status is tenuous, and she is at risk for worsening pulmonary edema.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, and she is anuric, which may lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK levels are stabilizing, but she is still at risk for further muscle damage and potential cardiac complications.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid status is critical, and she is at risk for worsening pulmonary edema and cardiac failure.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is unstable, and she is at risk for further cardiac complications such as stroke and heart failure.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to her underlying dementia, acute illness, and potential medication effects, and she is at risk for further decline in her cognitive function.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is tenuous, and she is at risk for further decline in her oxygenation and ventilation.
7. Sepsis: The patient has a history of pneumonia and is at risk for developing sepsis, which could further compromise her organ function.
8. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's CAD and atrial fibrillation make her at risk for further cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, and stroke.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's renal function and electrolyte levels closely and adjust her fluid status accordingly.
2. Continue to manage her atrial fibrillation with anticoagulation and rate control medications.
3. Consider hemodialysis if her renal function continues to decline.
4. Monitor her respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
5. Continue to manage her rhabdomyolysis with supportive care and consider further treatment options if necessary.
6. Monitor her mental status closely and consider further evaluation and treatment options if necessary.
7. Consider further imaging studies to evaluate her cardiac and pulmonary status.
8. Consult with a nephrologist and cardiologist to develop a comprehensive plan for her care."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU patient with a complex medical condition. The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, rhabdomyolysis, and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 86 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 166/54 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Atrial flutter

The patient has been receiving various medications, including heparin, furosemide (Lasix), and diuril. The patient's laboratory results show:

* Creatinine: 2.8 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 39 mg/dL
* Glucose: 111 mg/dL
* White blood cell count (WBC): 10.2 K/uL
* Hematocrit (Hct): 33.9%
* Platelet count (Plt): 169 K/uL

The patient's echocardiogram shows mild calcific aortic stenosis, mild pulmonary hypertension, and normal global biventricular systolic function. The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's altered mental status and inability to assess certain vital signs.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Further deterioration of renal function
* Development of sepsis or septic shock
* Increased risk of bleeding due to the patient's altered coagulation profile
* Development of cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation
* Increased risk of respiratory failure due to the patient's underlying pulmonary hypertension
* Development of gastrointestinal bleeding due to the patient's altered mental status and inability to assess certain vital signs.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), indicating that the patient's healthcare team has determined that the patient would not benefit from aggressive resuscitation efforts in the event of cardiac arrest."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia, CAD, and atrial flutter who was admitted to the ICU for LUE thrombectomy and flutter with RVR. She has developed worsening renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload, and anuria. Her mental status is altered, and she is lethargic. She has a Foley catheter in place to monitor urine output, and her family is open to the idea of hemodialysis if necessary.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Progressive Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 2.8, and she is anuric. If not addressed, this could lead to further worsening of renal function and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK levels are stabilizing, but she is still at risk for further muscle damage and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient is at risk for further fluid overload, which could exacerbate her respiratory status and increase her risk of developing pulmonary edema.
4. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is not well-controlled, and she is at risk for further episodes, which could lead to hemodynamic instability and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of factors, including her underlying dementia, sedation, and acute illness. If not addressed, this could lead to further deterioration in her mental status and potentially life-threatening complications.
6. Infection: The patient's left eye is erythematous and has a difficult-to-assess pupil, which may indicate an eye infection. If left untreated, this could lead to further complications and potentially blindness.
7. DVT/PE: The patient is at risk for developing DVT/PE due to her immobilization and underlying medical conditions. If left untreated, this could lead to potentially life-threatening complications.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and electrolytes closely.
2. Consider starting dialysis if the patient's creatinine level continues to rise.
3. Continue to manage the patient's rhabdomyolysis with bicarbonate and fluids as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's fluid status closely and consider discontinuing fluids if necessary.
5. Continue to manage the patient's atrial flutter with medications and consider cardioversion if necessary.
6. Reassess the patient's mental status regularly and consider adjusting her sedation regimen as necessary.
7. Consider starting antibiotics for the patient's potential eye infection.
8. Monitor the patient for signs of DVT/PE and consider starting prophylactic anticoagulation if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and paroxysmal atrial flutter. She was admitted to the hospital for left upper extremity (LUE) thrombectomy and atrial flutter with right ventricular overload (RVR). The patient developed worsening renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload, and underwent LUE fasciotomy.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.4°C, Tcurrent 36.1°C, HR 86 bpm, BP 166/54 mmHg, RR 18 inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has atrial flutter with a heart rate of 86 bpm and blood pressure of 166/54 mmHg
* Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 1,451 mL of fluids, with an output of 280 mL of urine and 126 mL of stool
* Respiratory support: The patient is receiving nasal cannula oxygen therapy and has an SpO2 of 100%
* Physical examination: The patient is sleeping and difficult to arouse, with a right eye that is reactive and a left eyelid that is erythematous and difficult to assess
* Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is 10.2 K/μL, hemoglobin is 10.2 g/dL, and creatinine is 3.9 mg/dL

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's condition include:

* Worsening renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is 3.9 mg/dL, which is a sign of worsening renal failure. The patient's urine output is also low, which can exacerbate the condition.
* Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's creatine kinase (CK) level is 39 mg/dL, which is a sign of rhabdomyolysis. The patient's muscle damage can lead to further complications, such as electrolyte imbalances and acidosis.
* Fluid overload: The patient has received a total of 1,451 mL of fluids, which can lead to fluid overload and further complicate the patient's condition.
* Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter can lead to further complications, such as heart failure and stroke.
* CAD: The patient's CAD can lead to further complications, such as myocardial infarction and heart failure.

Based on the patient's condition, the following potential complications should be closely monitored:

* Worsening renal failure: The patient's creatinine level should be closely monitored, and the patient's urine output should be increased to prevent further complications.
* Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK level should be closely monitored, and the patient should be treated with diuresis and electrolyte replacement to prevent further complications.
* Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance should be closely monitored, and the patient should be treated with diuresis and electrolyte replacement to prevent further complications.
* Atrial flutter: The patient's atrial flutter should be closely monitored, and the patient should be treated with antiarrhythmic medications and cardioversion to prevent further complications.
* CAD: The patient's CAD should be closely monitored, and the patient should be treated with antiplatelet medications and beta blockers to prevent further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications are identified:

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia, CAD, and paroxysmal atrial flutter who was admitted to the ICU for LUE thrombectomy and atrial flutter with RVR. She developed worsening renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload, and underwent LUE fasciotomy. The patient's current condition is complicated by ARF, rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is still elevated, and she is at risk of developing AKI due to ongoing hypoperfusion and rhabdomyolysis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status and lethargy may be related to sepsis, and further evaluation is needed to rule out infection.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's CAD and atrial flutter increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiac failure.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient's fluid overload and altered mental status increase her risk of respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and dementia increase her risk of neurological complications, such as stroke, seizures, or encephalopathy.
6. Infection: The patient's erythematous left eyelid and pupil difficulty to assess may indicate an eye infection, which requires further evaluation and treatment.
7. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's mild aortic stenosis and mild aortic regurgitation increase her risk of cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
8. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's mild pulmonary hypertension and rhonchorous lungs with scattered rales increase her risk of pulmonary complications, such as pulmonary edema or ARDS.

The patient's family has agreed to pursue hemodialysis if necessary, and the patient's medical team will continue to monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia, CAD, and paroxysmal atrial flutter who was transferred to the ICU for LUE thrombectomy and atrial flutter with RVR complicated by worsening renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload, and now s/p LUE fasciotomy.

The patient's current condition is:

* Renal failure with ATN from hypoperfusion and rhabdomyolysis, with creatinine levels still rising but maintaining urine output.
* Rhabdomyolysis with downtrending CK levels.
* Hypoemia with presumed 3L volume overload.
* L brachial thrombus with s/p thromboembolectomy and fasciotomy.
* Atrial flutter with a history of flutter in the past, likely in setting of pain or acute illness.
* Altered mental status with dementia at baseline, no acute findings on CT head.
* Thrombocytopenia with downtrending platelet levels.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening renal failure requiring hemodialysis.
* Rhabdomyolysis leading to further muscle damage and organ dysfunction.
* Hypoemia exacerbating respiratory distress.
* L brachial thrombus causing further complications such as compartment syndrome or reperfusion injury.
* Atrial flutter leading to tachycardia and cardiac arrhythmias.
* Altered mental status worsening with potential for increased risk of falls or aspiration.
* Thrombocytopenia increasing the risk of bleeding complications.

The plan is to continue diuresis with diuril and lasix to manage fluid overload and renal failure, restart fluids with diuresis to manage rhabdomyolysis, and continue monitoring for worsening renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, and hypoemia. The patient's family has agreed to hemodialysis if necessary, and the patient's cardiologist has signed off on the plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia, CAD, and paroxysmal atrial flutter. She was transferred to the hospital for LUE thrombectomy and treatment of atrial flutter with RVR, complicated by worsening renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload, and LUE fasciotomy.

The patient's current condition is characterized by:

* ARF with ATN from hypoperfusion and rhabdomyolysis, with a goal urine output of 100 cc/h and diuresis with diuril and lasix.
* Rhabdomyolysis with downtrending CK levels.
* Fluid overload, stable oxygen requirement, and responding to diuretics and rate-controlled.
* L brachial thrombus with compartment syndrome, managed with thromboembolectomy and fasciotomy.
* Atrial flutter, managed with heparin gtt and consideration of IV dilt if relapses into RVR.
* CAD, managed with ASA 325mg, beta blocker, and consideration of statin if LFTs are normal.
* Altered mental status, managed with sedation and reassessment in the morning.
* Thrombocytopenia, managed with heparin gtt.
* ICU care includes nutrition with Nutren Renal, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening renal failure and need for hemodialysis.
* Rhabdomyolysis with further progression and potential need for hemodialysis.
* Fluid overload with further worsening and potential need for intubation.
* Atrial flutter with relapse into RVR and potential need for IV dilt.
* CAD with further progression and potential need for invasive management.
* Altered mental status with further deterioration and potential need for increased sedation.
* Thrombocytopenia with further progression and potential need for platelet transfusion.
* Infection, particularly eye infection, with potential need for antibiotic therapy.
* VAP with potential need for antibiotic therapy and consideration of endotracheal intubation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia, CAD, and paroxysmal atrial flutter who was transferred to the ICU for LUE thrombectomy and atrial flutter with RVR. She has developed worsening renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload, and now has undergone LUE fasciotomy. She is currently receiving diuretic therapy and has had a downtrending creatinine level. Her cardiac rhythm is atrial flutter with a heart rate of 69 beats per minute. She has a history of altered mental status, but no acute findings on CT head.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is still elevated, and she may require hemodialysis if her condition worsens.
2. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK level is downtrending, but she may still be at risk for further muscle damage.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient has a history of fluid overload and may require further diuretic therapy to manage her fluid status.
4. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter is currently well-controlled, but she may require further titration of her metoprolol therapy.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is downtrending, and she may require further monitoring and potential treatment.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be a concern, particularly given her history of dementia.
7. Sepsis: The patient's history of fluid overload and rhabdomyolysis may put her at risk for developing sepsis.
8. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's history of LUE thrombectomy and atrial flutter with RVR may put her at risk for developing a pulmonary embolism.

Recommendations:

1. Continue diuretic therapy to manage the patient's fluid status and creatinine level.
2. Monitor the patient's platelet count and consider further treatment if necessary.
3. Continue to titrate the patient's metoprolol therapy to control her atrial flutter.
4. Monitor the patient's mental status and consider further evaluation if necessary.
5. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's rhabdomyolysis.
6. Monitor the patient's fluid balance and consider further diuretic therapy if necessary.
7. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's potential sepsis.
8. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's potential pulmonary embolism."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of dementia, CAD, and paroxysmal atrial flutter, who was admitted for LUE thrombectomy and atrial flutter with right ventricular failure. She developed worsening renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, fluid overload, and required LUE fasciotomy. She is currently in the ICU with ongoing management of her conditions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, and blood pressure of 151/42 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula. Her laboratory results show worsening renal function, with a creatinine level of 4.4 mg/dL, and ongoing rhabdomyolysis, with a CK level of 89 U/L.

The patient's plan includes:

* Goal urine output of 100 cc/hour
* Resuming fluids and continuing diuresis with diuril and lasix
* Appreciation of renal consult
* Consideration of hemodialysis if necessary
* Restarting fluids with diuresis for rhabdomyolysis
* Weaning oxygen as possible
* Continuing diuresis for hypoemia
* F/u with plastics and vascular recs for L brachial thrombus
* Titration of metoprolol for atrial flutter
* Follow-up for altered mental status and thrombocytopenia

Potential medical complications:

* Worsening renal failure and need for hemodialysis
* Ongoing rhabdomyolysis and potential for further muscle damage
* Fluid overload and potential for respiratory compromise
* Atrial flutter and potential for arrhythmia
* Thrombocytopenia and potential for bleeding
* Altered mental status and potential for further decline
* Complications related to LUE fasciotomy and potential for reperfusion injury."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
