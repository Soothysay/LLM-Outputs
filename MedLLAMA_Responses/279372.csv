   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o ventricular arrythmia.
   - obtain PCP records
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE to eval EF on [**11-1**]
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - hold lidocaine ggt; if goes back in VF then amiodarone, since no
   ischemic disease.
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - EEG and neurology consultation
   - monitor coags and lytes while cooled
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated.
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate was
   elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.
   - treating with HCO3 bolus to prevent acidosis induced VF.
   - continue IVF support, insulin drip, lyte replete.
   - q1h glucose check, with ABG's to see if he is responding to
   treatment.
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis
   - wean sedation in am as tolerated
   - emperically coverage with zosyn.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o ventricular arrythmia.
   - obtain PCP records
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE to eval EF on [**11-1**]
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - hold lidocaine ggt; if goes back in VF then amiodarone, since no
   ischemic disease.
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - EEG and neurology consultation
   - monitor coags and lytes while cooled
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated.
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate was
   elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.
   - treating with HCO3 bolus to prevent acidosis induced VF.
   - continue IVF support, insulin drip, lyte replete.
   - q1h glucose check, with ABG's to see if he is responding to
   treatment.
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis
   - wean sedation in am as tolerated
   - emperically coverage with zosyn.

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest, likely due to primary arrhythmic arrest. He had a history of ventricular arrhythmia.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiac: He is intubated and sedated, with a Swan-Ganz catheter in place. His blood pressure is 93/58 mmHg, with a central venous pressure of 18 cmH2O. His cardiac output is 8.1 L/min, with a cardiac index of 2.5 L/min/m2. He has a moderate degree of tricuspid regurgitation and a mildly elevated pulmonary artery pressure.
* Respiratory: He is mechanically ventilated, with a tidal volume of 550 mL, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. His oxygen saturation is 100%.
* Neurological: He is sedated and paralyzed, with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3. He has a concern for anoxic injury due to his cardiac arrest.
* Metabolic: He has a metabolic acidosis, with a lactate level of 5.3 mmol/L and a base excess of -12 mmol/L. He is being treated with insulin and sodium bicarbonate.
* Renal: His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 23.5 mg/dL, and his creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL.
* Hematological: His white blood cell count (WBC) is 35.3 K/uL, and his platelet count is 277 K/uL.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of ventricular arrhythmia and his current cardiac condition make him at risk for developing cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory arrest and his current mechanical ventilation may lead to respiratory failure.
3. Neurological sequelae: The patient's anoxic injury and his current sedation and paralysis may lead to neurological sequelae.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if his lactate level continues to rise.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels may indicate kidney damage, which could lead to renal failure.
6. Hematological complications: The patient's low platelet count and his current bleeding may lead to hematological complications.

Based on the patient's condition, the following plan is recommended:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust his medications as necessary.
2. Wean the patient off the ventilator and sedation as tolerated.
3. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his medications as necessary.
4. Continue to treat the patient's metabolic acidosis with insulin and sodium bicarbonate.
5. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his medications as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's hematological status and adjust his medications as necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o ventricular arrythmia.  Unclear etiology ? if
   metabolic related (ie. Hyperthyroidism) vs infection
   (pulmonary/intra-abdominal)
   - obtain PCP records
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE to eval EF on [**11-1**]
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - hold lidocaine ggt; if goes back in VF then amiodarone, since no
   ischemic disease.
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - EEG and neurology consultation
   - monitor coags and lytes while cooled
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated, currently only on
   levophed
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate was
   elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.
   - treating with HCO3 bolus to prevent acidosis induced VF.
   - continue IVF support, insulin drip, lyte replete.
   - q1h glucose check, with ABG's to see if he is responding to
   treatment.
   - serial ABG check.
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis
   - wean sedation in am as tolerated
   - emperically coverage with zosyn.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. He is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, with several potential medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

The patient's cardiac arrest was likely caused by a primary arrhythmogenic event, possibly related to ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis, or long QT syndrome. He had a history of ventricular arrhythmia, and his cardiac index was elevated at 6.3 L/min/m2.

The patient's neurological status is compromised, with concern for anoxic injury due to the cardiac arrest. He is currently on a cooling protocol and is being monitored for coagulation and electrolyte abnormalities.

The patient has metabolic acidosis, likely due to tissue ischemia, with an anion gap of 18 and a delta-delta value of 6-9. He is receiving IV fluids and insulin drips to manage his hyperglycemia and acidosis.

The patient's respiratory status is also compromised, with a respiratory arrest likely related to the cardiac arrest. He is currently intubated and sedated, and his oxygen saturation is being monitored.

The patient has several potential medical complications that require close monitoring and management, including:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac arrest was likely caused by a primary arrhythmogenic event, and he may be at risk for further arrhythmias.
2. Neurological compromise: The patient's anoxic injury may lead to further neurological decline, and he requires close monitoring for coagulation and electrolyte abnormalities.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's anion gap is elevated, and he requires close monitoring and management of his acidosis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory arrest may lead to further respiratory decline, and he requires close monitoring of his oxygen saturation and ABG values.
5. Sepsis: The patient's infection risk is increased due to his respiratory and cardiac compromise, and he requires close monitoring for signs of sepsis.
6. DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to his immobility and cardiac compromise, and he requires close monitoring for signs of DVT.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness may lead to stress ulceration, and he requires close monitoring for signs of bleeding.
8. VAP: The patient's intubation and sedation may increase his risk for VAP, and he requires close monitoring for signs of VAP.

In summary, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his cardiac, neurological, metabolic, respiratory, and infectious complications. He requires careful management of his medications, fluids, and electrolytes, as well as close monitoring of his vital signs and laboratory values."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o ventricular arrythmia.  Unclear etiology ? if
   metabolic related (ie. Hyperthyroidism) vs infection
   (pulmonary/intra-abdominal)
   - obtain PCP records
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE to eval EF on [**11-1**]
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - hold lidocaine ggt; if goes back in VF then amiodarone, since no
   ischemic disease.
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - monitor coags and lytes while cooled
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated after warming
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated, currently only on
   levophed
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate was
   elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.
   - treating with HCO3 bolus to prevent acidosis induced VF.
   - continue IVF support, insulin drip (pending warming), lyte replete.
   - q1h glucose check, with ABG's to see if he is responding to
   treatment.
   - serial ABG check q6h.
   - q6h lytes
   - consider RTA work-up given non-gap acidosis
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Cardiovascular:
	* Cardiac arrhythmias due to the patient's history of ventricular arrhythmia and the use of medications such as lidocaine and amiodarone.
	* Cardiogenic shock due to the patient's cardiac index being elevated, which may lead to further hypotension and organ dysfunction.
	* Pulmonary hypertension due to the patient's severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, which may lead to further respiratory compromise.
2. Neurological:
	* Anoxic brain injury due to the patient's cardiac arrest, which may lead to long-term cognitive and neurological deficits.
	* Seizures due to the patient's history of ventricular arrhythmia and the use of medications such as lidocaine and amiodarone.
3. Metabolic:
	* Metabolic acidosis due to the patient's elevated lactate levels and the use of bicarbonate drips, which may lead to further respiratory and cardiac compromise.
	* Hyperglycemia due to the patient's use of insulin drips and the presence of hyperglycemic episodes throughout the night.
4. Respiratory:
	* Respiratory failure due to the patient's respiratory arrest and the presence of bilateral dependent consolidations on chest CT scan, which may lead to further respiratory compromise.
	* Pneumonia due to the patient's aspiration and the presence of bilateral dependent consolidations on chest CT scan.
5. Infectious:
	* Sepsis due to the patient's suspected pulmonary and intra-abdominal infections, which may lead to further organ dysfunction and mortality.
	* Pneumonia due to the patient's aspiration and the presence of bilateral dependent consolidations on chest CT scan.

The patient's current medications include:

* Cisatracurium for paralysis
* Fentanyl for pain management
* Midazolam for sedation
* Norepinephrine for blood pressure support
* Insulin for glycemic control
* Zosyn for empirical coverage of aspiration pneumonia
* Protonix for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Heparin sodium for DVT prophylaxis

The patient's current laboratory results include:

* WBC: 35.3

   Axial hiatal hernia.  Trace ascites.  Stranding and fluid about the
   second portion of the duodenum, and duodenitis is not  excluded.
   - Cultures pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o ventricular arrythmia.  Unclear etiology ? if
   metabolic related (ie. Hyperthyroidism) vs infection
   (pulmonary/intra-abdominal)
   - obtain PCP records
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE to eval EF on [**11-1**]
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - hold lidocaine ggt; if goes back in VF then amiodarone, since no
   ischemic disease.
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - monitor coags and lytes while cooled
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated after warming
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated, currently only on
   levophed
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate was
   elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.
   - treating with HCO3 bolus to prevent acidosis induced VF.
   - continue IVF support, insulin drip (pending warming), lyte replete.
   - q1h glucose check, with ABG's to see if he is responding to
   treatment.
   - serial ABG check q6h.
   - q6h lytes
   - consider RTA work-up given non-gap acidosis
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis
   - wean sedation after warming as tolerated
   - emperically coverage with zosyn, d1 [**10-31**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest, likely due to primary arrhythmogenic arrest. He has a history of ventricular arrhythmia and is currently being treated for metabolic acidosis, hypotension, and respiratory arrest. He is intubated and sedated, and is being treated with a combination of medications to manage his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is likely due to primary arrhythmogenic arrest, but it is also possible that it was caused by ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or myocarditis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the arrest.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to tissue ischemia, but it is also possible that it is caused by a combination of factors, including hyperglycemia, hypoperfusion, and respiratory alkalosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the acidosis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to cardiogenic shock, but it is also possible that it is caused by other factors, such as vasopressor-resistant shock or septic shock. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the hypotension.
4. Respiratory Arrest: The patient's respiratory arrest is likely due to respiratory failure, but it is also possible that it is caused by other factors, such as pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic dysfunction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the respiratory arrest.
5. Neurologic Compromise: The patient's neurologic compromise is likely due to anoxic brain injury, but it is also possible that it is caused by other factors, such as intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral edema. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the neurologic compromise.
6. Infection: The patient's infection is likely due to aspiration pneumonia, but it is also possible that it is caused by other factors, such as sepsis or urinary tract infection. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the infection.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's gastrointestinal complications are likely due to stress ulceration, but it is also possible that they are caused by other factors, such as bowel ischemia or gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the gastrointestinal complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o ventricular arrythmia.  Unclear etiology ? if
   metabolic related (ie. Hyperthyroidism) vs infection
   (pulmonary/intra-abdominal)
   - obtain PCP records
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE to eval EF on [**11-1**]
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - hold lidocaine ggt; if goes back in VF then amiodarone, since no
   ischemic disease.
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - monitor coags and lytes while cooled
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated after warming
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated, currently only on
   levophed
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate was
   elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.
   - treating with HCO3 bolus to prevent acidosis induced VF.
   - continue IVF support, insulin drip (pending warming), lyte replete.
   - q1h glucose check, with ABG's to see if he is responding to
   treatment.
   - serial ABG check q6h.
   - q6h lytes
   - consider RTA work-up given non-gap acidosis
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis
   - wean sedation after warming as tolerated
   - emperically coverage with zosyn, d1 [**10-31**]

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest, likely due to primary arrhythmogenic arrest. He had a history of ventricular arrhythmia and was found to have mild coronary disease on cardiac catheterization. He is currently intubated and sedated, and is being treated for metabolic acidosis, hypotension, and respiratory arrest.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is likely to be recurrent, and he may require further treatment with anti-arrhythmic medications and cardioversion.
2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely to be exacerbated by his underlying condition and may require further treatment with bicarbonate therapy and insulin infusion.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to cardiogenic shock, and he may require further treatment with vasopressors and inotropes.
4. Respiratory arrest: The patient's respiratory arrest may be due to his underlying condition, and he may require further treatment with mechanical ventilation and sedation.
5. Neurological compromise: The patient's neurological compromise may be due to anoxic brain injury, and he may require further treatment with cooling therapy and EEG monitoring.
6. Infection: The patient's infection may be due to aspiration pneumonia, and he may require further treatment with antibiotics and respiratory support.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding may be due to his underlying condition, and he may require further treatment with anticoagulation therapy and endoscopy.
8. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure may be due to his underlying condition, and he may require further treatment with dialysis and electrolyte management.
9. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's pulmonary embolism may be due to his underlying condition, and he may require further treatment with anticoagulation therapy and thrombolytics.

The patient's current medications include:

* Cisatracurium for paralysis
* Fentanyl for pain management
* Midazolam for sedation
* Norepinephrine for vasopressor support
* Insulin for glycemic control
* Sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis
* Zosyn for empirical coverage of aspiration pneumonia
* Protonix for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Heparin for DVT prophylaxis

The patient's laboratory results include:

* White blood cell count: 35.3
* Hemoglobin: 13.8 g/dL
* Platelet count: 277 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1
* Troponin-T: 3.75
* Lactic acid: 5.3 mmol/L
* LDH: 1209 IU/L
* Calcium: 7.9 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 1.9 mg/dL

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o stress test in which a 4 beat run of polymoprhic
   NSVT was observed.  TTE notes EF 30-35% with dilation and global
   hypokinesis.  As patient had normal cardiac function per OSH
   cardiologist
s records as of several years ago, this may suggest an
   acute process causing heart failure in this patient.
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - continue on amiodarone
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest.  On Arctic Sun protocol, now warmed to 98.6 since 9pm
   yesterday.
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - f/u neurology
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - no longer on pressors.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely initially from tissue ischemia. Lactate
   was elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.  Currently improved with no continued evidence of gap
   acidosis.
   - cover with insulin sliding scale
   - d/c insulin gtt
   - monitor
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis, trial pressure
   support
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - d/c zosyn given no strong clinical signs of PNA at this time
   - I/O goal negative given about 7 L positive.
   - f/u AM CXR, sputum cx

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with cardiac arrest, likely due to primary arrhythmogenic arrest. He had a history of stress test showing polymorphic NSVT and echocardiogram showing EF 30-35% with dilation and global hypokinesis. The patient was intubated and sedated, and had a continuous EEG monitoring. He was treated with amiodarone, and his condition has been stabilized.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Neurologic Compromise: The patient is at risk of anoxic brain injury due to cardiac arrest. Continuous EEG monitoring is necessary to monitor for any changes in his neurological status.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to cardiogenic shock, and it is essential to monitor his blood pressure closely.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a mixed metabolic acidosis, likely due to tissue ischemia, hyperglycemia, and respiratory alkalosis. It is crucial to monitor his blood glucose levels and adjust his insulin therapy accordingly.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to his underlying cardiac condition and sedation. Close monitoring of his oxygen saturation and ABG is necessary.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing nosocomial infections, particularly pneumonia, due to his prolonged stay in the ICU.
6. Cardiac Complications: The patient is at risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia, due to his underlying cardiac condition.
7. Renal Complications: The patient is at risk of developing acute kidney injury due to his underlying cardiac condition and potential hypotension.
8. Nutritional Complications: The patient may be at risk of malnutrition due to his prolonged stay in the ICU and inability to eat orally.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is stable, but he is at risk of developing various medical complications. Close monitoring of his vital signs, laboratory results, and medical condition is necessary. The patient's treatment plan includes continued monitoring of his cardiac rhythm, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels, as well as ongoing therapy with amiodarone and insulin. He will also be monitored for signs of infection, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory failure."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o ventricular arrythmia.  Unclear etiology ? if
   metabolic related (ie. Hyperthyroidism) vs infection
   (pulmonary/intra-abdominal)
   - obtain PCP records
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE EF 30-35 Moderate to severe moderate to severe global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %). The right ventricular cavity
   is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. - monitor CBC, CMP
   - After AM VF, patient was started on Amiodarone drip
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - monitor coags and lytes while cooled
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated after warming
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated, currently only on
   levophed
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate was
   elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.
   - treating with HCO3 bolus to prevent acidosis induced VF.
   - continue IVF support, insulin drip (pending warming), lyte replete.
   - q1h glucose check, with ABG's to see if he is responding to
   treatment.
   - serial ABG check q6h.
   - q6h lytes
   - consider RTA work-up given non-gap acidosis
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis
   - wean sedation after warming as tolerated
   - emperically coverage with zosyn, d1 [**10-31**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest, likely due to a primary arrhythmogenic arrest. He had a history of ventricular arrhythmia and was started on an amiodarone drip after the arrest. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for cardiac arrest, neurologic compromise, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, and respiratory arrest.

The patient's cardiac arrest was likely due to a combination of factors, including primary arrhythmogenic arrest, ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and myocarditis. The patient's cardiac function is compromised, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30-35%.

The patient's neurologic status is compromised, with concern for anoxic injury. He is currently on a cooling protocol and is being monitored for coagulation and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's hypotension is likely due to a cardiogenic shock process, and he is being treated with vasopressors. The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to tissue ischemia and lactate elevation.

The patient's respiratory status is compromised, with a need for intubation and sedation. His respiratory alkalosis is likely due to the sedation and is being treated with modification of his TV and RR.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac arrest and compromised cardiac function put him at risk for further cardiac complications, including arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac failure.
2. Neurologic complications: The patient's neurologic compromise and anoxic injury put him at risk for further neurologic complications, including brain edema, cerebral vasospasm, and long-term neurologic deficits.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory arrest and compromised respiratory status put him at risk for further respiratory complications, including respiratory failure, pneumonia, and respiratory distress syndrome.
4. Metabolic complications: The patient's metabolic acidosis and hyperglycemia put him at risk for further metabolic complications, including diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma, and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and prolonged hospitalization put him at risk for infection, including sepsis, pneumonia, and catheter-related bloodstream infections.
6. Bleeding complications: The patient's compromised coagulation status and prolonged hospitalization put him at risk for bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and bleeding from catheter sites.
7. Renal complications: The patient's compromised renal function and prolonged hospitalization put him at risk for renal complications, including acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o ventricular arrythmia.  Unclear etiology ? if
   metabolic related (ie. Hyperthyroidism) vs infection
   (pulmonary/intra-abdominal)
   - obtain PCP records
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE EF 30-35 Moderate to severe moderate to severe global left
   ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %). The right ventricular cavity
   is dilated with severe global free wall hypokinesis. - monitor CBC, CMP
   - continue on Amiodarone drip
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated after warming
   - f/u neurology
   - pressure support trial if fighting the vent.
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - no longer on pressors.
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate was
   elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]

   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.

   diagnosis of DM.  resolved issue.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 55-year-old man, was admitted to the ICU after a cardiac arrest with episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF), pulseless electrical activity (PEA), and asystole. The patient has a history of ventricular arrhythmia and is currently on an amiodarone drip. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated, and a cardiac ultrasound (TTE) showed moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30-35%. The patient is also experiencing neurologic compromise, likely due to anoxic injury, and is being treated with a cooling protocol. The patient has a metabolic acidosis, likely due to tissue ischemia, and is being treated with insulin and sodium bicarbonate. The patient is also intubated and sedated, and is receiving respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's cardiac arrest is a high-risk condition that can lead to further complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiac tamponade, or cardiogenic shock.
2. Neurologic Compromise: The patient's anoxic injury may lead to long-term neurologic deficits, such as cognitive impairment, memory loss, or seizures.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis can lead to further complications, such as kidney damage, cardiac arrhythmias, or respiratory failure.
4. Respiratory Complications: The patient's intubation and sedation may lead to respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated lung injury, or respiratory failure.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system may lead to infections, such as sepsis, pneumonia, or urinary tract infections.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiac disease may lead to further complications, such as heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac tamponade.
7. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's compromised gut function may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and adjust the amiodarone drip as necessary.
2. Continue to treat the patient's neurologic compromise with a cooling protocol and monitor for signs of anoxic injury.
3. Monitor the patient's metabolic acidosis and adjust insulin and sodium bicarbonate treatment as necessary.
4. Continue to provide respiratory support and monitor for signs of respiratory complications.
5. Monitor the patient's infection risk and take steps to prevent infections, such as maintaining good hygiene and using antibiotics judiciously.
6. Monitor the patient's cardiovascular status and adjust treatment as necessary to prevent further complications.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal function and take steps to prevent gastrointestinal complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of cardiac arrest. The patient's condition has been unstable, with multiple episodes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) requiring cardioversion.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications, including midazolam, fentanyl, amiodarone, and insulin. They are also receiving infusions of sodium bicarbonate and heparin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/76 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Their oxygen saturation is 97%, and they are receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, indicating cardiac injury. Their blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting acute kidney injury. Their liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal, with elevated ALT and AST levels. Their complete blood count (CBC) shows a white blood cell count of 15.7 K/uL, which is slightly elevated.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their critical illness and need for mechanical ventilation. They are not able to respond to verbal commands, and their movement and tone are not assessable.

Potential medical complications that may arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of VF and the need for cardioversion suggest a high risk of recurrent cardiac arrest.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and abnormal LFTs suggest a possible septic response.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate a risk of acute kidney injury.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's need for mechanical ventilation and the presence of pneumonia suggest a high risk of respiratory failure.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and the need for sedation and paralysis suggest a risk of neurological complications.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of stress ulcer and the presence of a nasogastric tube suggest a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's presence of a sheath and the use of heparin prophylaxis suggest a risk of deep vein thrombosis.

In summary, this patient is a critically ill individual with a history of cardiac arrest and multiple organ dysfunction. They require close monitoring and management of their condition to prevent potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o ventricular arrythmia.  Unclear etiology ? if
   metabolic related (ie. Hyperthyroidism) vs infection
   (pulmonary/intra-abdominal)
   - obtain PCP records
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE to eval EF on [**11-1**]
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - After AM VF, patient was started on Amiodarone drip
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - monitor coags and lytes while cooled
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated after warming
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated, currently only on
   levophed
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate was
   elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.
   - treating with HCO3 bolus to prevent acidosis induced VF.
   - continue IVF support, insulin drip (pending warming), lyte replete.
   - q1h glucose check, with ABG's to see if he is responding to
   treatment.
   - serial ABG check q6h.
   - q6h lytes
   - consider RTA work-up given non-gap acidosis
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis
   - wean sedation after warming as tolerated
   - emperically coverage with zosyn, d1 [**10-31**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o ventricular arrythmia.  Unclear etiology ? if
   metabolic related (ie. Hyperthyroidism) vs infection
   (pulmonary/intra-abdominal)
   - obtain PCP records
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] trend CE (expect elevation because of CPR)
   - TTE to eval EF on [**11-1**]
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - After AM VF, patient was started on Amiodarone drip
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest. Currently on cooling protocol.
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - monitor coags and lytes while cooled
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated after warming
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - wean down pressor (dopa/levo) as tolerated, currently only on
   levophed
   - Consider changing to Neo since this has less B1 ionotropic effect.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely from tissue ischemia. Lactate was
   elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.
   - treating with HCO3 bolus to prevent acidosis induced VF.
   - continue IVF support, insulin drip (pending warming), lyte replete.
   - q1h glucose check, with ABG's to see if he is responding to
   treatment.
   - serial ABG check q6h.
   - q6h lytes
   - consider RTA work-up given non-gap acidosis
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - monior O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis
   - wean sedation after warming as tolerated
   - emperically coverage with zosyn, d1 [**10-31**]

Based on the progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest, likely due to primary arrhythmogenic arrest. He had a history of ventricular arrhythmia and unclear etiology, which may be related to metabolic factors (e.g., hyperthyroidism) or infection (pulmonary or intra-abdominal).

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Cardiac: He is on amiodarone drip and has been started on cooling protocol due to concern for anoxic injury.
* Neurological: He is on continuous EEG monitoring with reflex neurology consultation, and his sedation will be weaned as tolerated after warming.
* Respiratory: He is intubated and sedated, with a CXR showing mild hilar fullness, but no signs of pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic dysfunction.
* Metabolic: He has metabolic acidosis likely due to tissue ischemia, with an anion gap (AG) of 18 and delta-delta of 6-9, indicating a combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).
* Hypotension: He has been treated with levophed and is being weaned down as tolerated.
* Other: He has been started on empiric coverage with zosyn, and his lines have been inserted.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Cardiac: VFib arrest, PEA, and asystole may recur, and the patient may develop cardiogenic shock or heart failure.
* Neurological: The patient may develop anoxic brain injury, seizures, or neurological deficits.
* Respiratory: The patient may develop respiratory failure, pneumonia, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
* Metabolic: The patient may develop diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperglycemia, or metabolic alkalosis.
* Infections: The patient may develop sepsis, pneumonia, or intra-abdominal infections.

To manage these potential complications, the patient will need to be closely monitored and treated with medications as necessary. The plan is to continue IVF support, insulin drip, and lyte repletion, and to wean sedation and pressors as tolerated. The patient will also need to be monitored for signs of cardiac, neurological, respiratory, and metabolic compromise."

   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o stress test in which a 4 beat run of polymoprhic
   NSVT was observed.  TTE notes EF 30-35% with dilation and global
   hypokinesis.  As patient had normal cardiac function per OSH
   cardiologist
s records as of several years ago, this may suggest an
   acute process causing heart failure in this patient.
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - d/c
d amiodarone due to prolonged PR.
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest.  On Arctic Sun protocol, now warmed to 98.6 since 9pm
   yesterday.  Over-breathing the vent, no pupil light reflex.  Off
   sedation.  Patient has lost corneal reflexes and now has dilated
   midline pupils bilaterally, indicative of very poor prognosis.  CT head
   showed aggressively worsened brain edema worrisome for impending
   herniation.  Per Neurology, no indication for mannitol/hyperventilation
   given catastrophic area of injury.
   - f/u neurology recs
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - DNR, no escalation of care, now on dopa only.
   - organ bank discussion
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely initially from tissue ischemia.
   - currently on insulin gtt
   - monitor
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated on AC.  Patient has been noted to be overbreathing the vent
   at this time.
   - monitor O2 sats and ABG prn
   - continue to monitor overbreathing; if patient suddenly stops, concern
   for brain death
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - d/ced zosyn given no strong clinical signs of PNA at this time

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o stress test in which a 4 beat run of polymoprhic
   NSVT was observed.  TTE notes EF 30-35% with dilation and global
   hypokinesis.  As patient had normal cardiac function per OSH
   cardiologist
s records as of several years ago, this may suggest an
   acute process causing heart failure in this patient.
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - d/c
d amiodarone due to prolonged PR.
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest.  On Arctic Sun protocol, now warmed to 98.6 since 9pm
   yesterday.  Over-breathing the vent, no pupil light reflex.  Off
   sedation.  Patient has lost corneal reflexes and now has dilated
   midline pupils bilaterally, indicative of very poor prognosis.  CT head
   showed aggressively worsened brain edema worrisome for impending
   herniation.  Per Neurology, no indication for mannitol/hyperventilation
   given catastrophic area of injury.
   - f/u neurology recs
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - DNR, no escalation of care, now on dopa only.
   - organ bank discussion
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely initially from tissue ischemia.
   - currently on insulin gtt
   - monitor
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated on AC.  Patient has been noted to be overbreathing the vent
   at this time.
   - monitor O2 sats and ABG prn
   - continue to monitor overbreathing; if patient suddenly stops, concern
   for brain death
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - d/ced zosyn given no strong clinical signs of PNA at this time
   - I/O goal negative given about 7 L positive.

   Code status:
   Disposition:<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a cardiac arrest. The note highlights several critical events that have occurred since admission:

1. The patient's neuro status has deteriorated significantly, with loss of corneal reflexes, dilated midline pupils bilaterally, and a CT scan showing worsening brain edema, indicating a poor prognosis.
2. The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, with episodes of hypertension followed by hypotension, which may be related to a cardiogenic shock process.
3. The patient has developed a metabolic acidosis, likely due to tissue ischemia, and is currently being treated with insulin.
4. The patient is intubated and on assisted ventilation, with concerns about over-breathing the ventilator.
5. The patient's cardiac status is critical, with a history of VFib arrest, PEA, and asystole, and a TTE showing EF 30-35% with dilation and global hypokinesis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Brain death: Given the patient's severe brain edema and loss of corneal reflexes, there is a high risk of brain death.
2. Cardiac arrest: The patient's history of VFib arrest and PEA makes it likely that cardiac arrest will recur.
3. Sepsis: The patient's metabolic acidosis and potential tissue ischemia increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's over-breathing of the ventilator and potential respiratory arrest increase the risk of respiratory failure.
5. Multi-organ failure: The patient's critical cardiac and neuro status, combined with the risk of sepsis and respiratory failure, increase the risk of multi-organ failure.

Given the patient's poor prognosis and the decision to make him DNR, the focus of care should be on providing comfort and symptom management."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - @1530 neuro noted that patient had lost corneal reflexes, which he
   had had in the morning
   - @1630 CT scan head showed significantly increased brain edema
   worrisome for impending herniation.  Per Neuro, prognosis is very
   grave; no emergent management (i.e. mannitol, hyperventilation)
   warranted.
   - family informed, NEOB informed, they will come by around 9AM [**11-3**]
   - spoke to patient's cardiologist.  Apparently, he had been referred
   from PCP for [**Name9 (PRE) **] on stress test (unclear why this was performed).  Pt
   was started on BB and cathed, which was clean with normal V-gram.  Plan
   was to f/u in 1 yr for repeat stress but patient was lost to f/u.
   - @0100 pt became hypertensive to SBP 190s for several minutes and then
   relatively quickly MAPs dropped to low 60s - high 50s.  Pressors
   started.  Pt noted to have low tidal volumes on PS, switched to AC.
   - @0200 pupils noted to dilated bilaterally (midline positioning)
   - initial concern for brain death, however it was then noted that
   patient was overbreathing ventilator, after which no further effort to
   pursue brain death protocol overnight
   - family agreed to make patient DNR; additionally, they would like no
   further escalation of care, but do not wish to withdraw care at this
   time

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - @1530 neuro noted that patient had lost corneal reflexes, which he
   had had in the morning
   - @1630 CT scan head showed significantly increased brain edema
   worrisome for impending herniation.  Per Neuro, prognosis is very
   grave; no emergent management (i.e. mannitol, hyperventilation)
   warranted.
   - family informed, NEOB informed, they will come by around 9AM [**11-3**]
   - spoke to patient's cardiologist.  Apparently, he had been referred
   from PCP for [**Name9 (PRE) **] on stress test (unclear why this was performed).  Pt
   was started on BB and cathed, which was clean with normal V-gram.  Plan
   was to f/u in 1 yr for repeat stress but patient was lost to f/u.
   - @0100 pt became hypertensive to SBP 190s for several minutes and then
   relatively quickly MAPs dropped to low 60s - high 50s.  Pressors
   started.  Pt noted to have low tidal volumes on PS, switched to AC.
   - @0200 pupils noted to dilated bilaterally (midline positioning)
   - initial concern for brain death, however it was then noted that
   patient was overbreathing ventilator, after which no further effort to
   pursue brain death protocol overnight
   - family agreed to make patient DNR; additionally, they would like no
   further escalation of care, but do not wish to withdraw care at this
   time

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o stress test in which a 4 beat run of polymoprhic
   NSVT was observed.  TTE notes EF 30-35% with dilation and global
   hypokinesis.  As patient had normal cardiac function per OSH
   cardiologist
s records as of several years ago, this may suggest an
   acute process causing heart failure in this patient.
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - d/c
d amiodarone due to prolonged PR.
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest.  On Arctic Sun protocol, now warmed to 98.6 since 9pm
   yesterday.  Over-breathing the vent, no pupil light reflex.  Off
   sedation.  Patient has lost corneal reflexes and now has dilated
   midline pupils bilaterally, indicative of very poor prognosis.  CT head
   showed aggressively worsened brain edema worrisome for impending
   herniation.  Per Neurology, no indication for mannitol/hyperventilation
   given catastrophic area of injury.
   - f/u neurology recs
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - DNR, no escalation of care, now on dopa only.
   - organ bank discussion
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely initially from tissue ischemia.
   - currently on insulin gtt
   - monitor
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated on AC.  Patient has been noted to be overbreathing the vent
   at this time.
   - monitor O2 sats and ABG prn
   - continue to monitor overbreathing; if patient suddenly stops, concern
   for brain death
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - d/ced zosyn given no strong clinical signs of PNA at this time
   - I/O goal negative given about 7 L positive.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's condition as follows:

The patient is a 55-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest due to a primary arrhythmogenic arrest, likely caused by an acute process leading to heart failure. He has been on cardiac support for several years and had a normal cardiac function until this episode.

Neurologically, the patient has shown catastrophic deterioration, with loss of corneal reflexes, dilated pupils, and CT scans showing aggressive worsening of brain edema, worrisome for impending herniation. The patient is non-responsive, has no withdrawal to nail bed pressure, and is over-breathing the ventilator.

Respiratory support is being provided through endotracheal intubation and assisted ventilation. The patient has a history of stress test, which showed a 4-beat run of polymorphic NSVT, and a TTE note showing EF 30-35% with dilation and global hypokinesis.

The patient's laboratory results show acute kidney injury, liver dysfunction, and metabolic acidosis. He has been on dopamine infusion for blood pressure support and is being monitored for potential complications.

The patient's code status is DNR, and the family has requested no escalation of care but does not wish to withdraw care at this time. The patient's prognosis is considered hopeless, and the family has been informed of this.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Impending herniation due to worsening brain edema
2. Respiratory failure due to over-breathing the ventilator
3. Cardiac arrest due to underlying cardiac disease
4. Sepsis or infection due to prolonged ICU stay
5. Kidney injury or failure due to underlying disease
6. Liver dysfunction or failure due to underlying disease
7. Metabolic acidosis or alkalosis due to underlying disease or treatment
8. Pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
9. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)
10. Stress ulcer or gastrointestinal bleeding due to underlying disease or treatment.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o stress test in which a 4 beat run of polymoprhic
   NSVT was observed.  TTE notes EF 30-35% with dilation and global
   hypokinesis.  As patient had normal cardiac function per OSH
   cardiologist
s records as of several years ago, this may suggest an
   acute process causing heart failure in this patient.
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - d/c
d amiodarone given bradycardia with prolonged PR
   - DNR/DNI
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest.  On Arctic Sun protocol, now warmed to 98.6 since 9pm
   yesterday.
   -  Not brain dead given spontaneous respirations (would pass apnea
   test)
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - f/u neurology
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.   Very labile today
   - Monitor BP
   - no escalation of pressors, currently on dopamine.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely initially from tissue ischemia. Lactate
   was elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.  Currently improved with no continued evidence of gap
   acidosis.
   - cover with insulin sliding scale
   - d/c insulin gtt
   - monitor
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.
   - monitor O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis, trial pressure
   support
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - d/c zosyn given no strong clinical signs of PNA at this time
   - I/O goal negative given about 7 L positive.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - @1530 neuro noted that patient had lost corneal reflexes, which he
   had had in the morning
   - @1630 CT scan head showed significantly increased brain edema
   worrisome for impending herniation.  Per Neuro, prognosis is very
   grave; no emergent management (i.e. mannitol, hyperventilation)
   warranted.
   - family informed, NEOB informed, they will come by around 9AM [**11-3**]
   - spoke to patient's cardiologist.  Apparently, he had been referred
   from PCP for [**Name9 (PRE) **] on stress test (unclear why this was performed).  Pt
   was started on BB and cathed, which was clean with normal V-gram.  Plan
   was to f/u in 1 yr for repeat stress but patient was lost to f/u.
   - @0100 pt became hypertensive to SBP 190s for several minutes and then
   relatively quickly MAPs dropped to low 60s - high 50s.  Pressors
   started.  Pt noted to have low tidal volumes on PS, switched to AC.
   - @0200 pupils noted to dilated bilaterally (midline positioning)
   - initial concern for brain death, however it was then noted that
   patient was overbreathing ventilator, after which no further effort to
   pursue brain death protocol overnight
   - family agreed to make patient DNR; additionally, they would like no
   further escalation of care, but do not wish to withdraw care at this
   time

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with cardiac arrest and has been in the ICU for several days. The patient has experienced significant clinical deterioration, including:

1. Loss of corneal reflexes, indicating potential brain injury.
2. Significant increase in brain edema on CT scan, worrisome for impending herniation.
3. Hypertensive crisis with systolic blood pressure (SBP) 190s, followed by rapid drops in mean arterial pressure (MAP) to low 60s-high 50s.
4. Dilation of pupils bilaterally, raising concern for brain death.
5. Respiratory arrest, requiring intubation and sedation.
6. Metabolic acidosis, likely due to tissue ischemia, lactate, and hyperglycemia.
7. Leukocytosis, likely attributed to cardiac arrest rather than pneumonia.
8. Negative CT scan for pulmonary embolism (PE).

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Brain death or irreversible brain injury due to increased brain edema and potential herniation.
2. Cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory failure, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Metabolic acidosis, potentially leading to multi-organ dysfunction.
5. Sepsis, given the patient's recent cardiac arrest and potential infection.
6. Coagulopathy, given the patient's recent cardiac arrest and potential bleeding.
7. Nutritional deficiencies, given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and potential malnutrition.
8. Pressure ulcers, given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and potential immobility.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI without escalation of care, and the family has agreed to this. The patient's disposition is currently CCU, and the plan is to continue monitoring and managing the patient's condition closely."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o stress test in which a 4 beat run of polymoprhic
   NSVT was observed.  TTE notes EF 30-35% with dilation and global
   hypokinesis.  As patient had normal cardiac function per OSH
   cardiologist
s records as of several years ago, this may suggest an
   acute process causing heart failure in this patient.
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - d/c
d amiodarone due to prolonged PR.
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest.  On Arctic Sun protocol, now warmed to 98.6 since 9pm
   yesterday.  Over-breathing the vent, no pupil light reflex.
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - f/u neurology rec
   - prognosis poor
 recent CT of head showed worsening edema
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - DNR, no excelation of care, now on dopa only.
   - organ bank discussion
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely initially from tissue ischemia. Lactate
   was elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.  Currently improved with no continued evidence of gap
   acidosis.
   - cover with insulin sliding scale
   - d/c insulin gtt
   - monitor
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.
   - monitor O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis, trial pressure
   support
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - d/c zosyn given no strong clinical signs of PNA at this time
   - I/O goal negative given about 7 L positive.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - @1530 neuro noted that patient had lost corneal reflexes, which he
   had had in the morning
   - @1630 CT scan head showed significantly increased brain edema
   worrisome for impending herniation.  Per Neuro, prognosis is very
   grave; no emergent management (i.e. mannitol, hyperventilation)
   warranted.
   - family informed, NEOB informed, they will come by around 9AM [**11-3**]
   - spoke to patient's cardiologist.  Apparently, he had been referred
   from PCP for [**Name9 (PRE) **] on stress test (unclear why this was performed).  Pt
   was started on BB and cathed, which was clean with normal V-gram.  Plan
   was to f/u in 1 yr for repeat stress but patient was lost to f/u.
   - @0100 pt became hypertensive to SBP 190s for several minutes and then
   relatively quickly MAPs dropped to low 60s - high 50s.  Pressors
   started.  Pt noted to have low tidal volumes on PS, switched to AC.
   - @0200 pupils noted to dilated bilaterally (midline positioning)
   - initial concern for brain death, however it was then noted that
   patient was overbreathing ventilator, after which no further effort to
   pursue brain death protocol overnight
   - family agreed to make patient DNR; additionally, they would like no
   further escalation of care, but do not wish to withdraw care at this
   time

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU following a cardiac arrest with episodes of VFib, PEA, and asystole. The patient's condition has deteriorated significantly, with worsening brain edema and loss of corneal reflexes.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.2°C (97.2°F)
* Heart rate: 70 bpm
* Blood pressure: 88/47 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 94%
* Glasgow Coma Scale: not applicable (patient is intubated and sedated)

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 15.7 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 11.4 g/dL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - @1530 neuro noted that patient had lost corneal reflexes, which he
   had had in the morning
   - @1630 CT scan head showed significantly increased brain edema
   worrisome for impending herniation.  Per Neuro, prognosis is very
   grave; no emergent management (i.e. mannitol, hyperventilation)
   warranted.
   - family informed, NEOB informed, they will come by around 9AM [**11-3**]
   - spoke to patient's cardiologist.  Apparently, he had been referred
   from PCP for [**Name9 (PRE) **] on stress test (unclear why this was performed).  Pt
   was started on BB and cathed, which was clean with normal V-gram.  Plan
   was to f/u in 1 yr for repeat stress but patient was lost to f/u.
   - @0100 pt became hypertensive to SBP 190s for several minutes and then
   relatively quickly MAPs dropped to low 60s - high 50s.  Pressors
   started.  Pt noted to have low tidal volumes on PS, switched to AC.
   - @0200 pupils noted to dilated bilaterally (midline positioning)
   - initial concern for brain death, however it was then noted that
   patient was overbreathing ventilator, after which no further effort to
   pursue brain death protocol overnight
   - family agreed to make patient DNR; additionally, they would like no
   further escalation of care, but do not wish to withdraw care at this

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o stress test in which a 4 beat run of polymoprhic
   NSVT was observed.  TTE notes EF 30-35% with dilation and global
   hypokinesis.  As patient had normal cardiac function per OSH
   cardiologist
s records as of several years ago, this may suggest an
   acute process causing heart failure in this patient.
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - continue on amiodarone
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest.  On Arctic Sun protocol, now warmed to 98.6 since 9pm
   yesterday.
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - f/u neurology
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - no longer on pressors.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely initially from tissue ischemia. Lactate
   was elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.  Currently improved with no continued evidence of gap
   acidosis.
   - cover with insulin sliding scale
   - d/c insulin gtt
   - monitor
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.
   - monitor O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis, trial pressure
   support
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - d/c zosyn given no strong clinical signs of PNA at this time
   - I/O goal negative given about 7 L positive.
   - f/u AM CXR, sputum cx

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 year old man who presents with cardiac arrest.
    .
   # Cardiac arrest: VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. Most
   likely etiology is primary arrythmogenic arrest. DDx include ischemic
   cardiomyopathy, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, myocarditis,
   long QT syndrome in decreasing order of likelihood.  Per cardiology
   records, he had a h/o stress test in which a 4 beat run of polymoprhic
   NSVT was observed.  TTE notes EF 30-35% with dilation and global
   hypokinesis.  As patient had normal cardiac function per OSH
   cardiologist
s records as of several years ago, this may suggest an
   acute process causing heart failure in this patient.
   - monitor CBC, CMP
   - continue on amiodarone
   .
   # Neurologic compromise: Concern for anoxic injury in setting of
   cardiac arrest.  On Arctic Sun protocol, now warmed to 98.6 since 9pm
   yesterday.
   - Continuous EEG for 24 hours with reflex neurology consultation
   - arctic sun treatment protocol
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - f/u neurology
   .
   # Hypotension: Initially in setting of VF, suggesting a cardiogenic
   shock proccess. Worsening of hypotension may have been artifactual,
   related to a line. CI during cath and a line tracing from femoral
   sheath support this.
   - Monitor BP
   - no longer on pressors.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis: likely initially from tissue ischemia. Lactate
   was elevated. AG of 18 with delta-delta of [**6-9**] (0.5) is indictive of a
   combined metabolic acidosis (AG and non-AG).  AG is due to lactate [**1-30**]
   hypoperfusion that is complicated by the hyperglycemic episodes
   thoughout the night [**1-30**] HCO3 gtt. Non-AG is of unclear etiology, could
   be [**1-30**] dilutional effect and respiratory alkalosis though can not rule
   out RTA etiology.  He was given experimental dose of medication, likely
   contributed to the hyperglycemia.  And he was receiving HCO3 in D5W.
   Clinically resemble DKA, though, he does not have a documented
   diagnosis of DM.  Currently improved with no continued evidence of gap
   acidosis.
   - cover with insulin sliding scale
   - d/c insulin gtt
   - monitor
   .
   # Respiratory arrest: Likely a consequence of VF arrest. Currently
   intubated and sedated. Note fild intubation most likely required
   paralysis. CXR with mild hilar fullness, but the rest of the exam in
   inconsistent with pulmonary edema or decompensated systolic
   dysfunction. Leukocytosis is most likely attributed  to arrest, and is
   less indicative of PNA. Although of low pretest probability PE CT was
   obtained in ED and was negative. Most recent ABG suggestive of
   metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.
   - monitor O2 sats and ABG prn
   - modify TV and RR to correct respiratory alkalosis, trial pressure
   support
   - wean sedation as tolerated
   - d/c zosyn given no strong clinical signs of PNA at this time
   - I/O goal negative given about 7 L positive.
   - f/u AM CXR, sputum cx

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old man who presented with cardiac arrest and was found to have a VFib arrest with episodes of PEA and asystole. He has been intubated and sedated, and is currently being managed in the ICU.

The patient's neurological status has deteriorated significantly, with loss of corneal reflexes, increased brain edema on CT scan, and bilateral dilated pupils. The neurologist has expressed grave concern about the patient's prognosis, and emergent management is not warranted.

The patient's cardiac status is also concerning, with a history of stress test showing polymorphic NSVT and a TTE showing EF 30-35% with dilation and global hypokinesis. The patient's cardiac function was previously normal, suggesting an acute process causing heart failure.

The patient's metabolic status is also concerning, with a metabolic acidosis likely due to tissue ischemia and lactate elevation. The patient's glucose levels have been elevated, and he has been given experimental medication that may have contributed to the hyperglycemia.

The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with a respiratory arrest likely due to the VFib arrest. He is currently intubated and sedated, and his ABG shows metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis.

The patient's family has been informed, and they have agreed to make the patient DNR. They do not wish to withdraw care at this time, but do not wish to escalate care further.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Further neurological deterioration, including brain death
2. Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia
3. Metabolic acidosis, including lactic acidosis or ketoacidosis
4. Respiratory failure, including pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome
5. Sepsis or septic shock, including multi-organ dysfunction
6. DVT or PE, including pulmonary embolism
7. Stress ulcer or bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding
8. VAP or other respiratory infections, including pneumonia or bronchitis

The patient's care plan includes:

1. Monitoring of his neurological status, including continuous EEG and reflex neurology consultation
2. Monitoring of his cardiac status, including cardiac enzymes and echocardiogram
3. Monitoring of his metabolic status, including glucose levels and lactate levels
4. Monitoring of his respiratory status, including ABG and chest X-ray
5. Weaning of sedation and mechanical ventilation as tolerated
6. F/u with neurology and cardiology consultants
7. D/c of Zosyn and insulin gtt
8. Monitoring of I/O goal and adjusting TV and RR as needed
9. F/u with primary care physician and cardiologist"
