   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of paroxysmal atrial fib admitted to the CCU
   for recurrent a fib with [**Age over 90 1427**].
   .
   # A fib:  The patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She had taken
   amiodarone for years in the past, however discontinued and restarted
   recently following DC cardioversion.  No clear cause of increased
   occurences of a fib with [**Last Name (STitle) 1427**], TSH on last admission wnl, UA and CXR
   today showed no signs of infection however pt has leukocytosis.
   Patient did not tolerate esmolol drip because of hypotension overnight.
   - Patient may not be able to have TEE/DCCV today because of holiday
   (unless she is unstable) so will call anesthesia to see availability
   today
   - Will continue amio overnight and if does not convert will likely be
   able to get TEE/cardioversion tomorrorw
   - continue systemic HTN with heparin gtt
   .
   # PUMP:  Pt has history of diastolic dysfunction with LVH but preserved
   EF.  Pt had evidence of volume overload after aggressive volume
   resuscitation in the ED on admission.
   - 40mg of IV lasix PRN as still with O2 requirement
   - Monitor for pulmonary edema, treat with PRN lasix.
   .
   # CORONARIES:  No previous cath, no previous history of MI.
   - ROMI
   - Continue aspirin
   .
   # Hypertension:  On recent admission lisinopril, amlodipine, metoprolol
   and HCTZ were discontinued.  Will monitor blood pressures with [**Last Name (STitle) 1427**].
   Likely will not need antihypertensives.
   - Will restart beta blockers as tolerated
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  A febrile, no subjective fevers.  No clear sign of
   infection on CXR or UA.  As the patient has been admitted recently,
   will consider C diff if develops diarrhea.  Likely stress reaction, as
   noted on previous admission as well.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female admitted to the ICU for recurrent atrial fibrillation (a fib) with a recent history of paroxysmal a fib. The patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) but preserved ejection fraction (EF). 

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Heart rhythm: Atrial flutter with 2:1 block at a rate of 125-128 beats per minute (bpm)
* Oxygen saturation: 91-93% on 6 liters of oxygen
* Blood pressure: 96/64 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute
* White blood cell count: 17.8-17.6 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 45.6-41.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 368-322 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1-1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 117-127 mg/dL

The patient's condition has been managed with amiodarone drip and bolus, but the patient did not tolerate esmolol drip due to hypotension. The patient's leukocytosis is being monitored, and the possibility of Clostridioides difficile (C diff) infection is being considered.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Atrial flutter with 2:1 block: This can lead to tachycardia, palpitations, and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 96/64 mmHg, which is relatively low. This can lead to organ hypoperfusion and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction and LVH, which can lead to pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and potential C diff infection can lead to sepsis and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's atrial flutter and 2:1 block can lead to cardiac tamponade, which can be life-threatening.
6. Stroke: The patient's atrial flutter and 2:1 block can lead to stroke, which can be life-threatening.
7. Cardiac arrest: The patient's atrial flutter and 2:1 block can lead to cardiac arrest, which can be life-threatening.

The patient's plan of care includes continued management with amiodarone, monitoring for pulmonary edema, and consideration of TEE/CV if the patient's condition does not improve. The patient will also be monitored for leukocytosis and potential C diff infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of paroxysmal atrial fib admitted to the CCU
   for recurrent a fib with [**Age over 90 1427**].
   .
   # A fib:  The patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She had taken
   amiodarone for years in the past, however discontinued and restarted
   recently following DC cardioversion.  No clear cause of increased
   occurences of a fib with [**Last Name (STitle) 1427**], TSH on last admission wnl, UA and CXR
   today showed no signs of infection however pt has leukocytosis.
   - Attempt chemical cardioversion with amiodarone drip with 150mg bolus
   - No chronic anticoagulation per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], but as pt will likely
   need DCCV in AM, will start heparin drip
   - Will monitor pressures after starting amio drip, if can tolerate and
   still in [**Last Name (LF) 1427**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] consider esmolol drip.
   .
   # PUMP:  Pt has history of diastolic dysfunction with LVH but preserved
   EF.  Pt had evidence of volume overload after aggressive volume
   resuscitation in the ED on admission.
   - 40mg of IV lasix on admission
   - Monitor for pulmonary edema, treat with PRN lasix.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 90-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with recurrent atrial fibrillation (AFib) and is currently in a 2:1 flutter at a rate of 125. She has a history of paroxysmal AFib and has taken amiodarone in the past. She was recently discharged from the hospital and restarted amiodarone after DC cardioversion. The patient has leukocytosis and is being monitored for signs of infection.

Medical Complications:

1. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's AFib is a potential medical complication, as it can lead to heart failure, stroke, and other cardiac complications.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate an underlying infection or stress reaction, which needs to be monitored and managed accordingly.
3. Volume Overload: The patient's history of diastolic dysfunction and LVH may increase her risk of volume overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and other complications.
4. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and recent discontinuation of antihypertensive medications may increase her risk of hypertension, which can lead to cardiac complications.
5. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's history of diastolic dysfunction and LVH may increase her risk of coronary artery disease, which can lead to myocardial infarction and other complications.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient will be monitored closely for signs of infection, heart failure, and other complications. She will receive treatment for her atrial fibrillation, including amiodarone drip and possible esmolol drip. She will also receive treatment for her volume overload, including furosemide and monitoring for pulmonary edema. The patient's blood pressure will be monitored, and antihypertensive medications will be restarted as tolerated. She will also receive prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer."

   amiodarone for years in the past, however discontinued and restarted
   recently following DC cardioversion.  No clear cause of increased
   occurences of a fib with RVR, TSH on last admission wnl, UA and CXR
   today showed no signs of infection however pt has leukocytosis.
   Patient did not tolerate esmolol drip because of hypotension overnight.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female admitted to the ICU for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was recently started on amiodarone after discontinuing it in the past.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Heart rhythm: Atrial flutter with a rate of 125-128 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 96/64 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 92%
* White blood cell count: 17.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 13.8 g/dL
* Creatinine: 1.3 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose: 127 mg/dL

The patient's medical history is significant for diastolic dysfunction with left ventricular hypertrophy but preserved ejection fraction, and she has a history of hypertension, which was recently treated with lisinopril, amlodipine, metoprolol, and HCTZ, which were discontinued on admission.

The patient's current medications include:

* Amiodarone drip
* Furosemide (Lasix) 40mg PRN
* Aspirin
* Heparin drip
* Tylenol for pain management
* Colace and senna for bowel regimen
* Ranitidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Pulmonary edema due to volume overload
* Hypotension due to esmolol drip
* Increased risk of stroke due to atrial fibrillation
* Increased risk of cardiac arrest due to rapid ventricular response
* Leukocytosis, which may be due to stress reaction or infection
* Hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy
* Hyperkalemia due to potassium-sparing diuretics
* Hypocalcemia due to hypoparathyroidism

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing amiodarone drip and monitoring for conversion to normal sinus rhythm
* Monitoring for pulmonary edema and treating with PRN lasix
* Continuing systemic heparin drip for DVT prophylaxis
* Monitoring for leukocytosis and treating with antibiotics if necessary
* Restarting beta blockers as tolerated
* Monitoring blood pressures and adjusting antihypertensive therapy as necessary
* Monitoring for signs of infection and treating with antibiotics if necessary
* Continuing stress ulcer prophylaxis with ranitidine
* Continuing bowel regimen with colace and senna
* Continuing pain management with tylenol
* Continuing glycemic control with insulin therapy as necessary."

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female admitted to the ICU for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She underwent cardioversion to sinus rhythm yesterday and is currently receiving amiodarone for maintenance of normal sinus rhythm. She has a history of diastolic dysfunction with left ventricular hypertrophy but preserved ejection fraction. Her physical examination is significant for pulmonary edema and extremity swelling, attributed to tachycardia and decreased filling. Her lab results show leukocytosis, elevated troponin levels, and abnormal cardiac enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen if her tachycardia and decreased filling continue, leading to respiratory failure.
2. Aspiration: The patient's history of leukocytosis and unclear source of infection, along with her recent cardioversion, increases her risk of aspiration.
3. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient's history of recurrent atrial fibrillation and recent cardioversion may lead to further cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
4. Heart Failure: The patient's history of diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary edema increases her risk of heart failure, which may worsen her symptoms and outcomes.
5. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and unclear source of infection may indicate an underlying infection, which could spread and worsen her condition.
6. Thromboembolic Events: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent cardioversion increases her risk of thromboembolic events, including stroke or pulmonary embolism.
7. Medication Toxicity: The patient's medication regimen, including amiodarone and lasix, may cause toxicity, particularly if her kidney function declines.
8. Kidney Dysfunction: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and heart failure increases her risk of kidney dysfunction, which could worsen her symptoms and outcomes.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's pulmonary edema closely and adjust her diuretic regimen as needed.
2. Consider further evaluation for aspiration, including PA LAT and sputum studies, and consult with a speech/swallow specialist.
3. Continue anticoagulation with warfarin and monitor the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) closely.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin levels regularly to detect any changes in cardiac function.
5. Consider further evaluation for infection, including blood cultures and imaging studies, if the patient's leukocytosis persists or worsens.
6. Monitor the patient's kidney function closely and adjust her diuretic regimen and medication dosages as needed.
7. Consider consulting with a cardiologist or intensivist to further evaluate and manage the patient's cardiac condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female admitted to the ICU for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was recently cardioverted. The patient's current medications include amiodarone, heparin, furosemide, lorazepam, and fentanyl. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/46 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 17.8 x 10^9/L, and mild elevation in creatinine and troponin T.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient's recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to hemodynamic instability, cardiac arrhythmias, and increased risk of stroke.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of infection or inflammation, which can lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and increased risk of mortality.
3. Cardiac dysfunction: The patient's history of diastolic dysfunction with left ventricular hypertrophy and preserved ejection fraction may lead to cardiac failure, pulmonary edema, and decreased cardiac output.
4. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension may lead to increased blood pressure, cardiac strain, and increased risk of stroke.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's mild elevation in creatinine and troponin T may indicate early signs of renal dysfunction, which can lead to decreased renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and increased risk of mortality.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen requirement and abnormal ABG results may indicate early signs of respiratory failure, which can lead to decreased lung function, hypoxia, and increased risk of mortality.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of diastolic dysfunction and cardiac failure may lead to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
8. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and abnormal laboratory results may indicate early signs of infection, which can lead to sepsis, organ dysfunction, and increased risk of mortality.

Based on the patient's current condition and potential medical complications, close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat any potential complications."

   today showed no signs of infection however pt has leukocytosis.
   Patient did not tolerate esmolol drip because of hypotension overnight.
   - Patient may not be able to have TEE/DCCV today because of holiday

Summary:

The patient is a 90-year-old female admitted to the CCU for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She had a DC cardioversion and is currently being treated with amiodarone and heparin for maintenance of sinus rhythm and anticoagulation. The patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction with left ventricular hypertrophy but preserved ejection fraction. She has been experiencing leukocytosis and is being monitored for signs of infection. The patient has a code status of full code and is being treated with a cardiac diet, pain management, and bowel regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications:
	* Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke.
	* The patient's history of diastolic dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy may increase the risk of cardiac complications.
2. Infection:
	* The patient's leukocytosis and lack of clear signs of infection on CXR and UA may indicate a potential infection, which could worsen her condition.
	* The risk of Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection is increased in patients with recent antibiotic use.
3. Gastrointestinal complications:
	* The patient's history of diastolic dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as constipation or bowel obstruction.
	* The use of laxatives and stool softeners may increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications.
4. Respiratory complications:
	* The patient's use of oxygen therapy and potential pulmonary edema may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure.
	* The patient's history of diastolic dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy may increase the risk of respiratory complications.
5. Neurological complications:
	* The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response may increase the risk of neurological complications, such as stroke or transient ischemic attack.
	* The patient's use of anticoagulation therapy may increase the risk of bleeding complications, which could worsen her neurological condition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo female with history of paroxysmal atrial fib admitted to the CCU
   for recurrent a fib with RVR.
   # A fib:  The patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She had taken
   amiodarone for years in the past, however discontinued and restarted
   recently following DC cardioversion.  No clear cause of increased
   occurences of a fib with RVR, TSH on last admission wnl, UA and CXR
   today showed no signs of infection however pt has leukocytosis.
   Patient did not tolerate esmolol drip because of hypotension overnight.
   - Patient may not be able to have TEE/DCCV today because of holiday
   (unless she is unstable) so will call anesthesia to see availability
   today
   - Will continue amio overnight and if does not convert will likely be
   able to get TEE/cardioversion tomorrorw
   - continue systemic HTN with heparin gtt
   # PUMP:  Pt has history of diastolic dysfunction with LVH but preserved
   EF.  Pt had evidence of volume overload after aggressive volume
   resuscitation in the ED on admission.
   - 40mg of IV lasix PRN as still with O2 requirement
   - Monitor for pulmonary edema, treat with PRN lasix.
   # CORONARIES:  No previous cath, no previous history of MI.
   - ROMI
   - Continue aspirin
   # Hypertension:  On recent admission lisinopril, amlodipine, metoprolol
   and HCTZ were discontinued.  Will monitor blood pressures with RVR.
   Likely will not need antihypertensives.
   - Will restart beta blockers as tolerated
   # Leukocytosis:  A febrile, no subjective fevers.  No clear sign of
   infection on CXR or UA.  As the patient has been admitted recently,
   will consider C diff if develops diarrhea.  Likely stress reaction, as
   noted on previous admission as well.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female admitted to the ICU for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She had been discharged from the hospital after DC cardioversion, but her condition has deteriorated, leading to her current admission.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 64 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 112/46 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 95% on a face tent.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a regular sinus rhythm, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallop sounds. Her lung fields are clear, and her abdomen is soft and non-tender.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.8 x 10^9/L, with a platelet count of 317 x 10^9/L. Her creatinine level is 1.7 mg/dL, and her troponin-T level is <0.01 ng/mL.

The patient's condition is complicated by leukocytosis, which may be related to a stress reaction or infection. She is being treated with amiodarone and heparin, and her blood pressure is being monitored closely.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Pulmonary edema: The patient's history of diastolic dysfunction and volume overload may increase her risk of developing pulmonary edema, particularly if her blood pressure is not well-controlled.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and lack of clear signs of infection on CXR or UA may indicate a potential infection, such as C. difficile.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and RVR may increase her risk of developing other cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
4. Hypertension: The patient's history of hypertension and recent discontinuation of antihypertensive medications may increase her risk of developing hypertension, particularly if her blood pressure is not well-controlled.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient's history of diastolic dysfunction and volume overload may increase her risk of developing renal dysfunction, particularly if her blood pressure is not well-controlled.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, it is essential to continue close monitoring of her vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings. Adjustments to her medications and treatment plan may be necessary to prevent or manage potential complications."

   for recurrent a fib with RVR.
   # A fib:  The patient is followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She had taken
   amiodarone for years in the past, however discontinued and restarted
   recently following DC cardioversion.  No clear cause of increased
   occurences of a fib with RVR, TSH on last admission wnl, UA and CXR
   today showed no signs of infection however pt has leukocytosis.
   Patient did not tolerate esmolol drip because of hypotension overnight.
   - S/p TEE/DCCV yesterday with persistent NSR following.
   - Will continue amio to help ensure maintaining NSR
   - continue systemic anticoagulation with heparin gtt, will discuss
   starting coumadin with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] today.
   # PUMP:  Pt has history of diastolic dysfunction with LVH but preserved
   EF.  Pt had evidence of volume overload after aggressive volume
   resuscitation in the ED on admission.
   - 40mg of IV lasix PRN as still with O2 requirement, will get CXR this
   morning
   - Monitor for pulmonary edema, treat with PRN lasix.
   # Leukocytosis:  Pt had a fever overnight to 100.6, however unclear
   source of infection.  CXR no infiltrate however unclear given large
   amount of pulmonary edema, may have underlying infection, will check
   repeat CXR today as still has new O2 requirement.  UA clean.  As the
   patient has been admitted recently, will consider C diff if develops
   diarrhea.  Likely stress reaction, as noted on previous admission as
   well.
   - Monitor for signs of infection and if develops start antibiotics
   # ARF:  Most likely secondary to poor output state as was in A fib with
   RVR for many days, with likely relative hypotension.  Could also be
   secondary to diuresis.  Will monitor [**Hospital1 7**]
   # CORONARIES:  No previous cath, no previous history of MI.  Cardiac
   enzymes never positive
   - Continue aspirin
   # Hypertension:  On recent admission lisinopril, amlodipine, metoprolol
   and HCTZ were discontinued.  Will monitor blood pressures with RVR.
   Likely will not need antihypertensives.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female admitted to the ICU for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She had a TEE/DCCV procedure yesterday, which resulted in persistent normal sinus rhythm (NSR). The patient is currently receiving amiodarone and heparin to maintain NSR and prevent thromboembolic events.

The patient has a history of diastolic dysfunction with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and preserved ejection fraction (EF). She had evidence of volume overload after aggressive volume resuscitation in the emergency department (ED) on admission.

The patient is also experiencing leukocytosis, fever, and new oxygen requirement, which may be related to an underlying infection. A chest X-ray (CXR) showed no signs of infection, but a repeat CXR is planned today to monitor for pulmonary edema.

The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) likely secondary to poor output state, relative hypotension, or diuresis. She is receiving diuretics and will continue to be monitored.

The patient has a history of hypertension, which was managed with multiple antihypertensive medications before admission. She is likely to restart beta blockers as tolerated.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis, fever, and new oxygen requirement may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's volume overload and AKI may lead to pulmonary edema, which can worsen respiratory status and increase the risk of respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and RVR increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient's anticoagulation therapy may not be adequate to prevent thromboembolic events, which can lead to stroke, pulmonary embolism, or deep vein thrombosis.
5. Kidney injury: The patient's AKI may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
6. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's cardiac status may worsen, leading to hypotension, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and cardiac status to prevent and manage these potential complications."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female admitted to the ICU for recurrent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She underwent TEE/DCCV with subsequent normalization of her heart rhythm. The patient is currently receiving amiodarone for rate and rhythm control, as well as systemic anticoagulation with heparin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 112/46 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 95% on a face tent. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery.

The patient's physical examination reveals a supple neck with no elevation of jugular venous pressure, and a normal cardiac examination with no murmurs or thrills. The patient's lungs are clear, and her abdomen is soft and non-tender. The patient's skin is without stasis dermatitis, ulcers, or scars.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac stress. The patient's creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels are elevated, suggesting possible acute kidney injury. The patient's glucose level is within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include:
