Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of hypertension, who was admitted to the ICU due to an unknown chief complaint. The patient received Hydral 10 mg for hypertension and has been receiving various medications, including infusions and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 49 beats per minute, blood pressure of 172/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has a second-degree atrioventricular block (Mobitz 2) and is receiving nasal cannula oxygen therapy.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a well-nourished appearance, with no signs of distress or discomfort. The patient's cardiovascular examination is normal, with a regular heart rhythm and no murmurs. The patient's respiratory examination is also normal, with clear breath sounds and no crackles. The patient's abdominal examination is soft and non-tender, with normal bowel sounds.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, platelet count of 243 K/uL, and creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL. The patient's troponin-T level is <0.01 ng/mL, indicating no evidence of myocardial infarction. The patient's calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels are within normal limits.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, which may lead to complications such as cardiac damage, cerebral edema, or retinal damage.
2. Second-degree atrioventricular block (Mobitz 2): The patient's heart rhythm is abnormal, which may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, syncope, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation is 98%, but may decrease if the patient develops respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and even respiratory arrest.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection, which can lead to sepsis, septic shock, or even death.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative, which may indicate fluid overload, which can lead to congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, or even death.

These potential complications highlight the need for close monitoring and management of the patient's condition in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   88yo woman w hx of HTN, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia who came in with
   syncope and found to have 2:1 AV block.  .
   .
   RHYTHM:  Mobitz type I or II could present with 2:1 block. Could
   perform vagal maneuvers to eval for block at AV node or perform
   exercise, atropine rx, etc to eval for block below AV node.  Will hold
   on these measures since she is stable.
   - Etiology likely from atenolol and slight worsening renal function.
   Also consider ischemic (accounts for 40% cases of AV block), increased
   vagal tone, or calcification of mitral valve.  She is maintaining BP
   but will monitor for hemodynamic instability.
   - d/w EP urgently at night if HD unstable.
   - atropine and [**Hospital1 **] pads at bedside
   - hold atenolol and consider more glucagon if bradycardia worsens.
   - EKG in am
   - will d/w EP in am re ? pacer as this appears to be symptomatic
   bradycardia a/w 2nd degree AV block.
   .
   CORONARIES: no known CAD.  EKG without ischemic changes.  Given that
   ischemia can lead to AV block, will continue cycle CE.
   - hold atenolol
   - continue asa
   .
   PUMP: Lungs clear but perhaps some mild pulmonary congestion on exam.
   Will keep I/O even for now but consider lasix if pulm edema worsens.
   Suspect cardiac output will improve with increasing HR
   .
   Rib Pain: No fracture and no effusion seen on CXR.
   - morphine and tylenol for pain control
   - Ice
   .
   Hypertension: on atenolol and lisinopril as outpatient.  Hold ACE in
   setting of renal dysfunction and try hydral prn.  Hold atenolol w
   bradycardia.  Treat pain with morphine.  Tolerate SBP 170s
   .
   ARF: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3 and now 1.5 with GFR 35.  Will hold
   ACE tonight and keep I/O even.  Check urine lytes
   .
   Hyperlipidemia: statin
   .
   Depression: fluoxetine 20 but hold ativan.  Monitor for delirium
   - check u/a to risk assess for delirium
   .
   Hypothyroidism: levothyroxine 75.  Will check TSH given the
   bradycardia.
   .
   FEN: NPO for now until stabilizes
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SQH
   -Pain management with morphine IV and tylenol PO
   -Bowel regimen with senna/colace

   88yo woman w hx of HTN, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia who came in with
   syncope and found to have 2:1 AV block.  .
   .
   RHYTHM:  Mobitz type I or II could present with 2:1 block. Could
   perform vagal maneuvers to eval for block at AV node or perform
   exercise, atropine rx, etc to eval for block below AV node.  Will hold
   on these measures since she is stable.
   - Etiology likely from atenolol and slight worsening renal function.
   Also consider ischemic (accounts for 40% cases of AV block), increased
   vagal tone, or calcification of mitral valve.  She is maintaining BP
   but will monitor for hemodynamic instability.
   - d/w EP urgently at night if HD unstable.
   - atropine and [**Hospital1 **] pads at bedside
   - hold atenolol and consider more glucagon if bradycardia worsens.
   - EKG in am
   - will d/w EP in am re ? pacer as this appears to be symptomatic
   bradycardia a/w 2nd degree AV block.
   .
   CORONARIES: no known CAD.  EKG without ischemic changes.  Given that
   ischemia can lead to AV block, will continue cycle CE.
   - hold atenolol
   - continue asa
   .
   PUMP: Lungs clear but perhaps some mild pulmonary congestion on exam.
   Will keep I/O even for now but consider lasix if pulm edema worsens.
   Suspect cardiac output will improve with increasing HR
   .
   Rib Pain: No fracture and no effusion seen on CXR.
   - morphine and tylenol for pain control
   - Ice
   .
   Hypertension: on atenolol and lisinopril as outpatient.  Hold ACE in
   setting of renal dysfunction and try hydral prn.  Hold atenolol w
   bradycardia.  Treat pain with morphine.  Tolerate SBP 170s
   .
   ARF: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3 and now 1.5 with GFR 35.  Will hold
   ACE tonight and keep I/O even.  Check urine lytes
   .
   Hyperlipidemia: statin
   .
   Depression: fluoxetine 20 but hold ativan.  Monitor for delirium
   - check u/a to risk assess for delirium
   .
   Hypothyroidism: levothyroxine 75.  Will check TSH given the
   bradycardia.
   .
   FEN: NPO for now until stabilizes

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia who was admitted to the ICU with syncope and found to have a 2:1 AV block. She is currently being monitored for hemodynamic instability and is receiving treatment for bradycardia. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 97°F, blood pressure of 172/56 mmHg, heart rate of 49 bpm, and respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, platelet count of 243 K/uL, and creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL. Her troponin-T level is less than 0.01 ng/mL, indicating no evidence of myocardial infarction.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a normal cardiovascular examination, with no murmurs or irregular rhythms. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender, and her extremities are without cyanosis or clubbing.

The patient's medical plan includes holding atenolol and considering more glucagon if bradycardia worsens. She will also receive atropine and pads at bedside, and an electrocardiogram will be performed in the morning. The patient's cardiac output is expected to improve with increasing heart rate.

Potential medical complications:

1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure is currently stable, but she may experience fluctuations in her blood pressure, which could lead to complications such as hypotension or hypertension.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is currently 49 bpm, which is within the normal range. However, if her bradycardia worsens, she may experience complications such as decreased cardiac output, hypotension, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's lungs are clear, but she may experience respiratory complications such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema, particularly if her cardiac output worsens.
4. Renal complications: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. She may experience further deterioration in her renal function, which could lead to complications such as acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's electrocardiogram shows a 2:1 AV block, which could lead to complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest."

Summary:

The patient is a [age]-year-old admitted to the ICU with no chief complaint. They received hydralazine 10mg for hypertension. The patient has a history of second-degree atrioventricular block (Mobitz 2) and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen therapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 49bpm, and blood pressure of 172/56mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with an SpO2 of 98% on nasal cannula oxygen. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.7K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.7g/dL, and platelet count of 243K/uL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated, and if left untreated, it may lead to end-organ damage, including cardiac, renal, and cerebral damage.
2. Respiratory Compromise: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but if the oxygen therapy is discontinued or reduced, the patient may experience respiratory failure.
3. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection. If left untreated, this could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
4. Bleeding Risk: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially with invasive procedures or medications that affect platelet function.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of second-degree atrioventricular block (Mobitz 2) and current tachycardia may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest.
6. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's nutrition is not well-documented, and if not properly managed, may lead to malnutrition and associated complications.
7. Glycemic Control: The patient's glucose levels are not well-controlled, and if not managed properly, may lead to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, which can have serious consequences.
8. Pressure Ulcer Risk: The patient's skin assessment is not documented, but given their immobility and potential for prolonged stay in the ICU, they may be at risk for pressure ulcers."

   Assessment and Plan
   88yo woman w hx of HTN, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia who came in with
   syncope and found to have 2:1 AV block.
   .
   RHYTHM: Patient continues in 2:1 av block. Unable to assess  Mobitz
   type I or II . HD stable. Possible etiology related to betablocker at
   home and mild [**Doctor First Name **] insufficiency. Could potentially be due to ischemia
   but EKG unchanged.
   - Hold beta blocker
   - Complete ROMI.
   - F/u EP reccs
   - atropine and [**Hospital1 **] pads at bedside
   - hold atenolol and consider more glucagon if bradycardia worsens.
   - Likely pacemaker on Monday if remains bradycardic .
   .
   CORONARIES: no known CAD.  EKG without ischemic changes.  Given that
   ischemia can lead to AV block, will continue cycle CE.
   - hold atenolol
   - continue asa
   .
   PUMP: Euvolemic on exam. EF 55% on TTE in [**2172**] with grade I diastolic
   dysfunction and  mild AS.
   - I/O goal roughly even
   .
   Rib Pain: S/p traumatic fall at home. No fracture and no effusion seen
   on CXR. Does not appear to be splinting on exam.
   - morphine and tylenol for pain control
   .
   Hypertension: on atenolol and lisinopril as outpatient.  Patient very
   HTN overnight. Given improved renal function will restart lisininopril
   and continue to hold beta blocker as documented above.
   - Start Lisinopril 20 mg daily
   - Hydral prn if needed for SBP greater than 180
   .
   ARF: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3, was l.5 on admission and now back to
   baseline at 1.2.  Likely due to reduce cardiac output in the setting of
   profound bradycardia.
   - f/u urine lytes
   .
   Hyperlipidemia: Continue statin
   .
   Depression: fluoxetine 20 but hold ativan.  Monitor for delirium

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with syncope and a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block. She has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 49 bpm, blood pressure of 172/56 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her physical examination reveals bradycardia, irregular heart rhythm, and no murmurs or gallop. She has a 2nd-degree AV block, Mobitz type II, and is being managed with atropine and hospital pads at the bedside. Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.7 K/μL, hemoglobin of 11.7 g/dL, and creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia could worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output, organ hypoperfusion, and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Atrioventricular Block: The patient's 2:1 AV block could progress to a complete heart block, requiring a pacemaker implantation.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension could worsen, leading to end-organ damage, including kidney damage, if left untreated.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's baseline creatinine of 1.1-1.3 mg/dL is elevated to 1.5 mg/dL, indicating acute kidney injury. Further deterioration could lead to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia could worsen, increasing her risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism could worsen, leading to decreased metabolic rate, fatigue, and potentially life-threatening complications if left untreated.
7. Depression: The patient's depression could worsen, leading to decreased quality of life, increased risk of suicide, and potentially life-threatening complications if left untreated.
8. Delirium: The patient's delirium could worsen, leading to increased risk of falls, fractures, and potentially life-threatening complications if left untreated.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Adjust her medication regimen as necessary to manage her bradycardia, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
3. Consider inserting a pacemaker if her bradycardia worsens or her AV block progresses to a complete heart block.
4. Continue to manage her pain with morphine and tylenol.
5. Monitor her urine output and electrolyte levels closely to ensure adequate hydration and electrolyte balance.
6. Consider referring her to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of her cardiac condition.
7. Continue to monitor her mental status and adjust her medication regimen as necessary to manage her depression and delirium."

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with syncope and diagnosed with 2:1 AV block. She has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 49 bpm, and blood pressure of 172/56 mmHg. She is receiving infusions and medications for her conditions, including beta blocker hold, complete ROMI, and atropine at bedside. Her physical examination shows bradycardic and irregular heart rhythm, with no murmurs or gallop sounds. Laboratory results show normal WBC and Hct, but elevated troponin-T and CK. ECG shows 2:1 AV block without ischemic changes.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardic and irregular heart rhythm may worsen, leading to cardiac arrest or hemodynamic instability.
2. AV Block: The patient's 2:1 AV block may progress to complete heart block, requiring a pacemaker or cardioverter-defibrillator.
3. Ischemia: Although ECG shows no ischemic changes, the patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and mild AS may increase the risk of ischemia, which could lead to cardiac complications.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen, leading to decreased cardiac output and increased risk of bradycardia.
5. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may exacerbate her cardiac condition, increasing the risk of cardiac complications.
6. ARF: The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.1-1.3, and her current level is 1.2. Further deterioration of renal function may occur, leading to electrolyte imbalances and other complications.
7. Delirium: The patient's history of depression and current medications may increase the risk of delirium, which could worsen her overall condition.
8. Pneumonia: The patient's history of rib pain and recent fall may increase the risk of pneumonia, which could worsen her respiratory status.
9. Sepsis: The patient's current conditions may increase the risk of sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ dysfunction and poor outcomes."

 INEFFECTIVE COPING
   88yo woman w hx of HTN, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia who came in with
   syncope and found to have 2:1 AV block.  .
   .
   RHYTHM:  Mobitz type I or II could present with 2:1 block. Could
   perform vagal maneuvers to eval for block at AV node or perform
   exercise, atropine rx, etc to eval for block below AV node.  Will hold
   on these measures since she is stable.
   - Etiology likely from atenolol and slight worsening renal function.
   Also consider ischemic (accounts for 40% cases of AV block), increased
   vagal tone, or calcification of mitral valve.  She is maintaining BP
   but will monitor for hemodynamic instability.
   - d/w EP urgently at night if HD unstable.
   - atropine and [**Hospital1 **] pads at bedside
   - hold atenolol and consider more glucagon if bradycardia worsens.
   - EKG in am
   - will d/w EP in am re ? pacer as this appears to be symptomatic
   bradycardia a/w 2nd degree AV block.
   .
   CORONARIES: no known CAD.  EKG without ischemic changes.  Given that
   ischemia can lead to AV block, will continue cycle CE.
   - hold atenolol
   - continue asa
   .
   PUMP: Lungs clear but perhaps some mild pulmonary congestion on exam.
   Will keep I/O even for now but consider lasix if pulm edema worsens.
   Suspect cardiac output will improve with increasing HR
   .
   Rib Pain: No fracture and no effusion seen on CXR.
   - morphine and tylenol for pain control
   - Ice
   .
   Hypertension: on atenolol and lisinopril as outpatient.  Hold ACE in
   setting of renal dysfunction and try hydral prn.  Hold atenolol w
   bradycardia.  Treat pain with morphine.  Tolerate SBP 170s
   .
   ARF: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3 and now 1.5 with GFR 35.  Will hold
   ACE tonight and keep I/O even.  Check urine lytes
   .
   Hyperlipidemia: statin
   .
   Depression: fluoxetine 20 but hold ativan.  Monitor for delirium
   - check u/a to risk assess for delirium
   .
   Hypothyroidism: levothyroxine 75.  Will check TSH given the
   bradycardia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia who presented with syncope and was found to have a 2:1 AV block. She is currently in the ICU and is being monitored closely.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 43 beats per minute, blood pressure of 160/62 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery, and her ABG results show a pH of 7.25, pCO2 of 25 mmHg, and pO2 of 104 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination is significant for a 2:1 AV block, which is being monitored closely. She is also experiencing delirium and confusion, which is being treated with zyprexa. Her pain is being managed with morphine and tylenol, and she is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatine kinase (216 IU/L), troponin-T (5.4 ng/mL), and myoglobin (4.2 ng/mL). Her white blood cell count is 9.7 x 10^9/L, and her platelet count is 243 x 10^9/L. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, and her glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is 35 mL/min.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's 2:1 AV block is a significant concern, and her heart rate may continue to slow further. This could lead to hemodynamic instability and even cardiac arrest.
2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of hypertension and hypothyroidism may increase her risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying lung disease and respiratory failure may worsen, leading to respiratory arrest.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and elevated levels of troponin-T and myoglobin may indicate the presence of sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
5. Renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels, as well as her decreased GFR, may indicate the presence of renal failure, which could worsen her overall condition.
6. Delirium: The patient's delirium and confusion may worsen, leading to agitation, aggression, and even respiratory failure.
7. Pain: The patient's pain is not well-controlled, and her underlying conditions may exacerbate her discomfort, leading to further complications.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications."

   RHYTHM:  Mobitz type I or II could present with 2:1 block. Could
   perform vagal maneuvers to eval for block at AV node or perform
   exercise, atropine rx, etc to eval for block below AV node.  Will hold
   on these measures since she is stable.
   - Etiology likely from atenolol and slight worsening renal function.
   Also consider ischemic (accounts for 40% cases of AV block), increased
   vagal tone, or calcification of mitral valve.  She is maintaining BP
   but will monitor for hemodynamic instability.
   - d/w EP urgently at night if HD unstable.
   - atropine and [**Hospital1 **] pads at bedside
   - hold atenolol and consider more glucagon if bradycardia worsens.
   - EKG in am

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia who was admitted with syncope and found to have a 2:1 AV block. She is currently stable but at risk for hemodynamic instability.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 43 beats per minute (bpm) with a normal range of 39-68 bpm
* Blood pressure: 160/62 mmHg with a normal range of 105/44-203/121 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute (bpm) with a normal range of 11-25 bpm
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's physical examination is notable for a second-degree AV block, Mobitz type II, and mild pulmonary congestion on lung exam.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 9.7-10.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 12.3-12.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 243-249 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.1-1.5 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: <0.01
* Glucose: 110-112 mg/dL

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia, and depression. She is currently taking atenolol, lisinopril, levothyroxine, and fluoxetine.

The patient's potential medical complications include:

* Bradycardia: The patient's second-degree AV block and bradycardia are at risk for worsening, which could lead to hemodynamic instability.
* Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is currently controlled, but she is at risk for worsening hypertension due to her underlying condition.
* ARF: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and she is at risk for further renal dysfunction.
* Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and may require further management.
* Depression: The patient's depression is being managed with fluoxetine, but she is at risk for worsening depression.
* Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism is being managed with levothyroxine, but she is at risk for worsening hypothyroidism.

The patient's plan includes:

* Holding atenolol due to bradycardia
* Monitoring for hemodynamic instability
* Performing an EKG in the morning
* Considering a pacemaker if the patient's symptoms worsen
* Continuing cycle CE for coronary artery disease
* Holding ACE inhibitor due to renal dysfunction
* Monitoring for pulmonary edema
* Managing pain with morphine and tylenol
* Monitoring for delirium and checking UA to risk assess for delirium
* Holding ativan due to depression
* Monitoring for hypothyroidism and checking TSH levels
* Keeping the patient NPO until she stabilizes
* Providing prophylaxis for DVT, pain management, and bowel regimen."

 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 INEFFECTIVE COPING
   88yo woman w hx of HTN, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia who came in with
   syncope and found to have 2:1 AV block.  .
   .
   RHYTHM:  Mobitz type I or II could present with 2:1 block. Could
   perform vagal maneuvers to eval for block at AV node or perform
   exercise, atropine rx, etc to eval for block below AV node.  Will hold
   on these measures since she is stable.
   - Etiology likely from atenolol and slight worsening renal function.
   Also consider ischemic (accounts for 40% cases of AV block), increased
   vagal tone, or calcification of mitral valve.  She is maintaining BP
   but will monitor for hemodynamic instability.
   - d/w EP urgently at night if HD unstable.
   - atropine and [**Hospital1 **] pads at bedside
   - hold atenolol and consider more glucagon if bradycardia worsens.
   - pacer to be placed Mon as this appears to be symptomatic bradycardia
   a/w 2nd degree AV block.
   - In anticipation of pacer on Mon, NPO after midnight on Sunday night
   and ensure left PIV
   .
   CORONARIES: no known CAD.  EKG without ischemic changes.  Given that
   ischemia can lead to AV block, will continue cycle CE.
   - hold atenolol
   - continue asa
   .
   PUMP: Lungs clear but perhaps some mild pulmonary congestion on exam.
   Will keep I/O even for now but consider lasix if pulm edema worsens.
   Suspect cardiac output will improve with increasing HR
   .
   Rib Pain: No fracture and no effusion seen on CXR.
   - morphine and tylenol for pain control
   - Ice
   .
   Hypertension: on atenolol and lisinopril as outpatient.  Hold ACE in
   setting of renal dysfunction and try hydral prn.  Hold atenolol w
   bradycardia.  Treat pain with morphine.  Tolerate SBP 170s
   .
   ARF: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3 and now 1.5 with GFR 35.  Will hold
   ACE tonight and keep I/O even.  Check urine lytes
   .
   Hyperlipidemia: statin
   .
   Depression: fluoxetine 20 but hold ativan.  Monitor for delirium
   - check u/a to risk assess for delirium
   .
   Hypothyroidism: levothyroxine 75.  Will check TSH given the
   bradycardia.
   .
   FEN: NPO for now until stabilizes
   ACCESS: PIV's
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SQH

   RHYTHM:  Mobitz type I or II could present with 2:1 block. Could
   perform vagal maneuvers to eval for block at AV node or perform
   exercise, atropine rx, etc to eval for block below AV node.  Will hold
   on these measures since she is stable.
   - Etiology likely from atenolol and slight worsening renal function.
   Also consider ischemic (accounts for 40% cases of AV block), increased
   vagal tone, or calcification of mitral valve.  She is maintaining BP
   but will monitor for hemodynamic instability.
   - d/w EP urgently at night if HD unstable.
   - atropine and [**Hospital1 **] pads at bedside
   - hold atenolol and consider more glucagon if bradycardia worsens.
   - pacer to be placed Mon as this appears to be symptomatic bradycardia

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary can be made:

The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia who was admitted with syncope and found to have a 2:1 AV block. She is currently being treated in the ICU for delirium, pain control, hypertension, and acute renal failure. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 43 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 160/62 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, with a GFR of 35, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a 2:1 AV block, and she is being monitored for potential complications such as bradycardia and hemodynamic instability.

The patient's medical history includes a recent episode of syncope, which may be related to her atenolol medication and worsening renal function. She is also at risk for ischemic heart disease, which may have contributed to her AV block. The patient's cardiac output is expected to improve with increasing heart rate, and she is being treated with morphine and tylenol for pain control.

The patient's delirium is being managed with zyprexa, and she is being monitored for potential complications such as respiratory failure and sepsis. Her nutritional status is being monitored, and she is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's 2:1 AV block and bradycardia may worsen, leading to hemodynamic instability and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Cardiac output impairment: The patient's cardiac output may be impaired due to her AV block and potentially ischemic heart disease, leading to decreased organ perfusion and potential organ failure.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and potential complications such as sepsis and respiratory failure.
4. Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen, leading to increased agitation, respiratory failure, and potential complications such as sepsis and cardiac arrest.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure and potential complications such as sepsis and cardiac arrest.
6. Sepsis: The patient may develop sepsis due to her underlying medical conditions, leading to potential complications such as organ failure and mortality.
7. Cardiac arrest: The patient may experience cardiac arrest due to her underlying cardiac conditions, leading to potential complications such as organ failure and mortality.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of her underlying medical conditions to prevent potential complications and improve her outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 INEFFECTIVE COPING
   88yo woman w hx of HTN, hypothyroidism, hyperlipidemia who came in with
   syncope and found to have 2:1 AV block.  .
   .
   RHYTHM:  Mobitz type I or II could present with 2:1 block. Could
   perform vagal maneuvers to eval for block at AV node or perform
   exercise, atropine rx, etc to eval for block below AV node.  Will hold
   on these measures since she is stable.
   - Etiology likely from atenolol and slight worsening renal function.
   Also consider ischemic (accounts for 40% cases of AV block), increased
   vagal tone, or calcification of mitral valve.  She is maintaining BP
   but will monitor for hemodynamic instability.
   - d/w EP urgently at night if HD unstable.
   - atropine and [**Hospital1 **] pads at bedside
   - hold atenolol and consider more glucagon if bradycardia worsens.
   - EKG in am
   - will d/w EP in am re ? pacer as this appears to be symptomatic
   bradycardia a/w 2nd degree AV block.
   .
   CORONARIES: no known CAD.  EKG without ischemic changes.  Given that
   ischemia can lead to AV block, will continue cycle CE.
   - hold atenolol
   - continue asa
   .
   PUMP: Lungs clear but perhaps some mild pulmonary congestion on exam.
   Will keep I/O even for now but consider lasix if pulm edema worsens.
   Suspect cardiac output will improve with increasing HR
   .
   Rib Pain: No fracture and no effusion seen on CXR.
   - morphine and tylenol for pain control
   - Ice
   .
   Hypertension: on atenolol and lisinopril as outpatient.  Hold ACE in
   setting of renal dysfunction and try hydral prn.  Hold atenolol w
   bradycardia.  Treat pain with morphine.  Tolerate SBP 170s
   .
   ARF: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3 and now 1.5 with GFR 35.  Will hold
   ACE tonight and keep I/O even.  Check urine lytes
   .
   Hyperlipidemia: statin
   .
   Depression: fluoxetine 20 but hold ativan.  Monitor for delirium
   - check u/a to risk assess for delirium
   .
   Hypothyroidism: levothyroxine 75.  Will check TSH given the
   bradycardia.

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia who was admitted to the ICU with syncope and found to have a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block. She has been experiencing delirium, confusion, and acute pain, and has been receiving various medications to manage her symptoms. Her vital signs are stable, but she has been experiencing bradycardia and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's 2:1 AV block and bradycardia increase her risk of cardiac arrest or sudden death. The patient's history of hypertension and hypothyroidism may also contribute to her cardiac risk.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's pulmonary congestion and mild pulmonary edema on exam increase her risk of respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
3. Renal complications: The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) and worsening renal function may lead to further decline in her kidney function or even renal failure.
4. Infectious complications: The patient's indwelling catheter and Foley catheter increase her risk of urinary tract infections.
5. Delirium and agitation: The patient's delirium and agitation may worsen if not managed properly, leading to increased risk of falls, injury, or even cardiac arrest.
6. Pain management: The patient's acute pain and chronic pain require proper management to prevent further complications.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if not properly managed, leading to further decline in her cardiac function.
8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia may increase her risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction or stroke.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's delirium, confusion, and acute pain require immediate attention. The patient's bradycardia and hypertension require close monitoring and management. The patient's cardiac output may improve with increasing heart rate. The patient's pulmonary congestion and mild pulmonary edema require close monitoring and management. The patient's acute kidney injury and worsening renal function require close monitoring and management. The patient's indwelling catheter and Foley catheter require close monitoring for signs of infection. The patient's delirium and agitation require close monitoring and management. The patient's hypothyroidism and hyperlipidemia require close monitoring and management."

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of depression, hypothyroidism, and newly diagnosed 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block. She was found to be symptomatic from AV block, assumed to be due to syncope. The patient is awaiting pacemaker placement. She has been experiencing bradycardia, irregular heart rhythm, and has been treated with atropine and Haldol for agitation. Her vital signs are stable, but she is experiencing difficulty arousing and has a heart rate of 47 bpm. She has a history of hypertension, which is being managed with atenolol and lisinopril. She is also experiencing rib pain, which is being managed with morphine and Tylenol.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is 47 bpm, which is lower than normal. This could lead to decreased cardiac output and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. AV Block: The patient's newly diagnosed 2:1 AV block could lead to further complications if not treated with a pacemaker.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism could be exacerbated by the stress of her current condition, leading to further complications.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's newly found elevated PTT could indicate a coagulopathy, which could lead to bleeding complications.
5. ARF: The patient's baseline creatinine is 1.1-1.3, and her current creatinine is 1.1. This could indicate acute kidney injury, which could lead to further complications.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's hyperlipidemia could lead to further complications if not managed properly.
7. Depression/Delerium: The patient's depression and delirium could lead to further complications if not managed properly.
8. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension could lead to further complications if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs closely, especially her heart rate and rhythm.
2. Proceed with pacemaker placement as planned.
3. Continue to manage the patient's hypertension with lisinopril and monitor her blood pressure closely.
4. Continue to manage the patient's pain with morphine and Tylenol.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's creatinine and electrolyte levels closely.
6. Consider uptitration of synthroid for the patient's hypothyroidism.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's coagulation status and consider d/c heparin if PTT remains elevated.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's mental status and consider increasing Haldol as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a diagnosis of symptomatic bradycardia with 2nd-degree AV block, likely due to atenolol and worsening renal function. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure of 127/33 mmHg, and SpO2 of 95%. The patient's physical examination reveals bradycardic and irregular heart rhythm, with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 243. The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.5, with a glomerular filtration rate of 35.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, renal failure, hyperlipidemia, depression, hypothyroidism, and fenestrated aortic aneurysm. The patient is currently receiving medications for hypertension, depression, and hyperlipidemia, and is also taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hemodynamic instability: Given the patient's bradycardia and worsening renal function, there is a risk of hemodynamic instability, which can lead to cardiovascular collapse.
2. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's 2nd-degree AV block and bradycardia may be indicative of cardiac tamponade, which can lead to cardiac arrest.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's pulmonary congestion on examination and increased risk of respiratory failure due to bradycardia.
4. Renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function and increased creatinine level may lead to further deterioration in renal function.
5. Delirium: The patient's depression and use of sedatives may increase the risk of delirium.
6. Pacer malfunction: The patient's upcoming pacemaker placement may lead to malfunction or complications during the procedure.
7. Infection: The patient's increased risk of infection due to prolonged hospitalization and use of invasive lines and devices.

Based on these potential complications, the patient should be closely monitored and managed with a multidisciplinary approach to prevent and treat any complications that may arise."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a pacemaker placement scheduled for later in the day. The patient has been experiencing agitation, which was managed with Haldol 0.5mg IV and Trazodone 25mg PO. Hydralazine 10mg IV was also administered.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate 47-73 beats per minute, blood pressure 127/33 mmHg, respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count 9.7-10.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin 12.3-12.5 g/dL
* Platelet count 243-249 K/uL
* Creatinine 1.1-1.2 mg/dL
* Troponin-T <0.01 ng/mL
* Glucose 110-112 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination is limited due to lack of assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Delirium and confusion, which may worsen due to inadequate pain control and hypertension.
* Hypertension, which may lead to end-organ damage if not managed promptly.
* Ineffective coping mechanisms, which may contribute to the patient's agitation and delirium.
* Potential bleeding complications due to the patient's coagulopathy (elevated PT and PTT).
* Respiratory compromise due to the patient's tachypnea and potential pulmonary edema.
* Cardiac complications due to the patient's second-degree AV block and potential cardiac arrhythmias.

The patient's plan of care should focus on managing their delirium and hypertension, ensuring effective pain control, and addressing any underlying coagulopathy."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient's condition remains unstable. The patient is still experiencing bradycardia, with a heart rate of 47 bpm, and has a second-degree AV block, Mobitz type II. The patient's blood pressure is 127/33 mmHg, and their oxygen saturation is 95% on nasal cannula.

The patient's respiratory support consists of nasal cannula oxygen delivery, and their physical examination reveals a difficult-to-arouse patient with bilateral chest crepitations. The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.7, hemoglobin of 35.0, and platelet count of 243. The patient's troponin-T level is <0.01, and their creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, depression, and hypothyroidism. They are currently receiving medications for these conditions, including atenolol, lisinopril, fluoxetine, and levothyroxine.

The patient's plan includes pacemaker placement, which is scheduled for today. The patient's rhythm is being monitored, and they are receiving atropine and pads at bedside. The patient's atenolol has been held due to their AV block, and their glucagon may need to be increased if their bradycardia worsens.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is already low, and further deterioration could lead to cardiac arrest.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's chest crepitations and low oxygen saturation could indicate early signs of respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac output decline: The patient's cardiac output may decline further due to their bradycardia and decreased forward flow.
4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could indicate an underlying infection.
5. Delirium: The patient's agitation and altered mental status could progress to delirium, which can be a life-threatening condition.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH level is elevated, which may indicate the need for uptitration of their synthroid medication.
7. Hyperlipidemia: The patient's statin medication may need to be adjusted or additional medication added to manage their hyperlipidemia.

Overall, the patient's condition remains critical, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent potential complications and improve their outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 88-year-old female with depression, hypothyroidism, and newly diagnosed 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block. She underwent a dual-chamber pacemaker implantation yesterday, during which she experienced hypotension, likely due to vagal response. She was treated with IV fluids and atropine. The patient is currently confused and disoriented, with a history of delirium. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine. She has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pacing-related complications: The patient's new pacemaker may cause arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, which can lead to cardiac arrest or stroke.
2. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state and recent pacemaker implantation may increase her risk of infection, including surgical site infections, pneumonia, or urinary tract infections.
3. Cardiac output impairment: The patient's decreased cardiac output due to bradycardia may lead to organ dysfunction, including renal failure, respiratory failure, or hepatic dysfunction.
4. Delirium: The patient's continued confusion and disorientation may worsen her delirium, leading to increased agitation, falls, or other complications.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of depression and delirium may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly if she is taking anticoagulant medications.
6. Respiratory failure: The patient's decreased cardiac output and possible pneumonia may lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
7. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and decreased cardiac output may worsen her renal function, leading to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
8. Thyroid dysfunction: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if her thyroid medication is not titrated correctly, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, or weight gain."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of depression, hypothyroidism, and newly diagnosed 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing syncope and was found to have a newly diagnosed 2:1 AV block, which was treated with a dual-chamber pacemaker. She is currently hypotensive and has a history of delirium.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Complications:**
	* Bradycardia: The patient's pacemaker may not be functioning properly, leading to bradycardia.
	* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's ECG showed atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of stroke and heart failure.
	* Cardiac output: The patient's cardiac output may be compromised due to her pacemaker and potential cardiac arrhythmias.
2. **Renal Complications:**
	* Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has increased, which may indicate AKI.
	* Renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine level is 1.1-1.3, which may indicate underlying renal insufficiency.
3. **Respiratory Complications:**
	* Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray showed bilateral infiltrates, which may indicate pneumonia.
	* Pulmonary edema: The patient's bibasilar crackles suggest pulmonary edema, which may be caused by cardiac failure or other factors.
4. **Gastrointestinal Complications:**
	* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of stress ulcer prophylaxis suggests a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
	* Bowel obstruction: The patient's bowel regimen with senna and colace may increase the risk of bowel obstruction.
5. **Infectious Complications:**
	* Sepsis: The patient's fever and tachycardia suggest a potential infection.
	* Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture is pending, and a UTI may be a potential complication.
6. **Neurological Complications:**
	* Delirium: The patient's delirium may worsen or be exacerbated by her pacemaker, medications, or other factors.
	* Cognitive decline: The patient's history of depression and hypothyroidism may increase the risk of cognitive decline.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and function.
2. Adjust the patient's pacemaker settings as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medications accordingly.
4. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and bowel regimen adjustments as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's temperature and tachycardia, and consider sepsis protocols if necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's delirium and cognitive function, and consider adjusting medications or therapies as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   88 yo F with Depression, Hypothyroidism p/w syncope and found to have
   newly diagnosed 2:1 av block now awaiting pacemaker.
   .
   RHYTHM:  Pt had pacer placed yesterday, pt was hypotensive (SBP 50
   during procedure, likely vagal. TTE did not show pericardial effusion.
   Receiced bous. Pt [**Name (NI) 5118**] and in the 70-80
s. Pt received vanco x1.
   Mobitz type I or II could present with 2:1 block. Atropine testing
   nondiagnostic by EP over the weekend. ROMI complete so unlikely
   ischemic in etiology, although 40% new 2:1 av block can be ischemic in
   origin.
   - will start keflex today x3 days
   - portable CXR this AM, PA/Lat when on the floor
   - pain control with Tylenol (holding narc given delirium)
   - add back BB?
   ..
   CORONARIES: no known CAD.  EKG without ischemic changes.
   - hold atenolol given av block
   - continue asa
   .
   PUMP: Lungs clear on exam.  Will keep I/O even for now but consider
   lasix if pulm edema worsens.  Suspect cardiac output will improve with
   increasing HR
   .
   Rib Pain: No fracture and no effusion seen on CXR.
   - morphine and tylenol for pain control
   - Ice
   - Consider repeat CXR in [**12-31**] days to reassess for rib fx
   .
   Hypertension: on atenolol and lisinopril as outpatient.  Holding
   atenolol as above. HTN be partially due to agitation.
   - Continue Lisinopril 20 mg daily
   - Agitation as below
   .
   ARF: Baseline creatinine 1.1-1.3 and now 1.1. Likely due to decreased
   CO and forward flow.
   - Trend Cr and lytes
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   Hyperlipidemia: continue statin
   .
   Depression/Delerium: SSRI d/c. Has not required haldol overnight. Still
   confused Delirium likely due to not sleeping over last 72 hrs in house.
   [**Month (only) 11**] also be exacerbated by SSRI.  U cx ngtd and afebrile.
   - Continue Haldol prn for agitation. Continue to monitor for worsening
   QTc
   - Hold fluoxetine for now
   - follow urine cx
   .
   Hypothyroidism:  On levothyroxine 75.  TSH elevated at 10 which may
   indicated patient could use uptitration of synthroid.
   -          Will defer titration of synthroid to outpatient providers
   -          .
   .
   Coagulopathy: Newly found elevated PTT today. [**Month (only) 11**] be lab error or could
   be having systemic absorption of Heparin.
   - Repeat PTT and Hct. If PTT elevated, will consider d/c heparin for
   pneumoboots

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old female with a history of depression, hypothyroidism, and newly diagnosed 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) block. She was found to have a newly diagnosed 2:1 AV block and was placed on a Sensia SEDR01 dual chamber pacer.

The patient had a hypotensive episode during the procedure, which was likely vagal. She received IV fluids and atropine, and her blood pressure improved. She also had atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response (RVR) of 150 beats per minute, which resolved without intervention.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 80 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 135/64 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 95%. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has a portable chest X-ray scheduled for today.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and troponin level, which may indicate an inflammatory response or cardiac damage. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

The patient's physical examination reveals a difficult-to-arouse patient with a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, which is bradycardic. Her chest is clear, and her abdomen is soft and non-tender.

The patient's medical history is significant for depression, hypothyroidism, and hypertension, which may be contributing to her current condition. She is receiving medication for pain control, blood pressure management, and thyroid replacement therapy.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of 2:1 AV block and atrial fibrillation with RVR may increase her risk of developing further cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and platelet count may indicate an inflammatory response or infection.
3. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may exacerbate her symptoms and increase her risk of developing further complications.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may worsen her cardiac condition and increase her risk of developing further complications.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 95% may indicate a risk of respiratory failure.

In conclusion, the patient is a high-risk patient with a complex medical condition. She requires close monitoring and management of her cardiac condition, electrolyte levels, and respiratory status. Her medical history and laboratory results suggest a potential risk of cardiac arrhythmias, infection, hypothyroidism, hypertension, and respiratory failure."
