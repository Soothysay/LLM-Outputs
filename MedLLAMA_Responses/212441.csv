   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 3383**] is an 84 year old female with CAD, AS, diastolic CHF
   admitted with a worsening shortness of breath.
   .
   1.  SOB.  Patient recently discharged from [**Hospital1 19**] with pneumonia,
   treated with levaquin and 14 day course of vancomycin for MRSA PNA
   completed on [**9-18**].  Now with leukocytosis, though denies fevers or
   chills.  Concern for pneumonia (hospital acquired given that she was at
   rehab and recently discharged).  Although increasing O2 requirements
   may be due to patient's inability to clear secretions due to weak
   cough/ deconditioning.  Has a history of PE, though currently with
   supratherapeutic INR.  Has history of diastolic heart failure with
   elevated BNP (though unknown baseline), elevated JVP, b/l LE edema
   (stable), and ""Mild CHF"" on CXR, which may be contributing to her SOB
   though did not tolerate diuresis in ED due to low BP.  Given
   leukocytosis, would favor treating pneumonia and then considering
   diuresis in a few days if she fails to respond.
   - continue albuterol, atrovent
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP
   - follow fever curve, wbc
   - frequent suctioning
   - consider diuresis if BP tolerates it
   - send sputum sample
   - PA and lateral CXR
   .
   2. A. fib.  Patient developed A. fib post-operatively after CABG on
   [**2138-7-29**] and has been treated with coumadin.  Now found to have
   supratherapeutic INR.  Currently in NSR.
   - continue amiodarone
   - hold coumadin given supratherapeutic INR
   - hold metoprolol for now given hypotension in ED
   .
   3.  CAD.  S/p CABG on [**2138-7-29**].  Initial set of cardiac enzymes showed
   normal CK and TropT of 0.05.  Not complaining of CP and EKG appears
   unchanged.
   - aspirin, simvastatin
   - hold lisinopril, metoprolol given hypotension in ED
   .
   4.       Hypotension.  Patient had hypotension to 70s overnight, after
   receiving lasix in ED.  From prior notes, appears to commonly have SBP
   of 100 or 110.  Given concern for pulmonary infection, will given fluid
   boluses to maintain SBP > 90.  Due to hypotension, unable to diurese
   patient.
   - fluid boluses to maintain SBP > 90
   5.       Sytolic murmur.  Patient with systolic murmur on exam.
   Recently had aortic valve replacement.  Echo following surgery showed
   1+ AR, and [**11-20**]+MR.
   - consider echo

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female admitted to the ICU with worsening shortness of breath, tachypnea, and a history of pneumonia, cardiac disease, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has undergone aortic valve replacement surgery and has a history of diastolic heart failure.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.5°F)
* Heart rate: 81 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 92/38 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 23 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient has a systolic murmur on examination, which may be related to her recent aortic valve replacement.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 17.0 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 244 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.06 ng/mL
* Glucose: 127 mg/dL
* Other laboratory results are within normal limits.

The patient's medications include:

* Albuterol
* Atrovent
* Vancomycin
* Cefepime
* Amiodarone
* Aspirin
* Simvastatin
* Lisinopril (held due to hypotension)
* Metoprolol (held due to hypotension)
* Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continuing antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia
* Monitoring for fever and leukocytosis
* Frequent suctioning to clear secretions
* Considering diuresis if the patient fails to respond to treatment
* Sending a sputum sample for culture
* Performing a chest X-ray (CXR) to rule out pneumonia
* Continuing anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation
* Holding coumadin due to supratherapeutic INR
* Holding metoprolol due to hypotension
* Aspirin and simvastatin for CAD

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia: The patient's recent discharge from the hospital and admission to the ICU with worsening shortness of breath and tachypnea suggest the possibility of hospital-acquired pneumonia.
* Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and supratherapeutic INR may increase the risk of stroke or systemic embolization.
* Cardiac disease: The patient's history of CAD and recent aortic valve replacement surgery may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
* Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension and need for fluid boluses to maintain blood pressure may increase the risk of cardiac complications or organ dysfunction.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and need for oxygen therapy may increase the risk of respiratory failure or ventilator dependence.
* Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and fever may suggest the possibility of infection, which could lead to sepsis or organ dysfunction.

Based on the patient's condition and plan of care, it is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and response to treatment to prevent or identify potential complications."

To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.06 ng/mL
* Blood glucose: 127 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Not well-nourished, thin
* Cardiovascular: S1 and S2 heart sounds are normal, with a 2/6 systolic murmur
* Respiratory: Breath sounds are not clear, with rhonchi diffusely
* Extremities: 2+ edema in both lower extremities
* Skin: Not assessed
* Neurologic: Not assessed

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Hypotension (not in shock)
* Pneumonia, aspiration
* ICU care
* Nutrition: Unknown
* Glycemic control: Unknown
* Lines: 20-gauge central line inserted
* Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis with Coumadin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI, VAP prophylaxis with HOB elevation and mouth care

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Sepsis and septic shock due to pneumonia and aspiration
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to pneumonia and aspiration
* Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension and potential sepsis
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, due to hypotension and potential sepsis
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and potential hypercoagulability
* Stress-related complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or pancreatitis, due to stress ulcer prophylaxis with PPI
* Infection-related complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to prolonged intubation and potential immunosuppression."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous cardiac surgery (CABG and AVR). She was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of shortness of breath (SOB), do not eat (DOE), and multifocal pneumonia (pna) with a right pleural effusion. The patient's recent medical history includes a MRSA pneumonia, which was treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.

Current vital signs include:

* Temperature: 37.4°C (99.4°F)
* Heart rate: 87 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 146/55 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 25 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 99%
* Blood glucose: 127 mg/dL

The patient is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressors. She has a nasogastric tube (NGT) in place for feeding and suctioning.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 17.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* Platelet count: 244 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.06 ng/mL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 27 mg/dL
* Serum albumin: 3.0 g/dL
* Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 517 IU/L
* Calcium: 9.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.6 mg/dL

The patient's chest X-ray shows a right pleural effusion and multifocal pneumonia with effusion. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest shows a right pleural effusion and bilateral infiltrates, likely due to aspiration.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and pleural effusion can lead to respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and bacteremia can lead to sepsis, which can cause organ dysfunction and even death.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of CAD and previous cardiac surgery can increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and heart failure.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's nasogastric tube and tube feeding can increase the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration, nausea, and vomiting.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's pneumonia and pleural effusion can lead to neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, and encephalopathy.
6. Infection control: The patient's pneumonia and pleural effusion can increase the risk of infection control issues, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI).

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Antibiotics: The patient will receive a 14-day course of antibiotics to cover MRSA and GNR.
2. Deep suctioning: The patient will receive deep suctioning as needed to help clear secretions.
3. Chest CT: The patient will undergo a chest CT to further evaluate her pleural effusion and pneumonia.
4. Thoracentesis: The patient may undergo a thoracentesis to drain her pleural effusion.
5. Cardiac monitoring: The patient will receive close cardiac monitoring to detect any cardiac complications.
6. Nutritional support: The patient will receive nutritional support through her nasogastric tube and tube feeding.
7. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient will receive stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Infection control: The patient will receive close monitoring for infection control issues, such as VAP and CLABSI."

Based on the provided medical progress note, I will summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU and identify potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and previous cardiac surgery (CABG and AVR). She was admitted to the ICU with symptoms of shortness of breath, do not eat, and multifocal pneumonia. The patient has a recent history of MRSA pneumonia and has not received adequate treatment. She is experiencing difficulty clearing secretions due to a weak cough and has been prescribed a 14-day course of antibiotics to cover MRSA, GNR, and anaerobes. The patient has also been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, diastolic dysfunction, and CAD, and is at risk for aspiration due to her lung disease.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pneumonia progression:** The patient's pneumonia may worsen if not adequately treated, leading to respiratory failure, sepsis, or even death.
2. **Aspiration risk:** The patient's risk of aspiration is high due to her lung disease, and the use of an NG tube may not be sufficient to prevent aspiration.
3. **Cardiac decompensation:** The patient's diastolic dysfunction and CAD may lead to cardiac decompensation, which can result in heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or even death.
4. **Coagulopathy:** The patient's supratherapeutic INR may lead to bleeding complications, particularly if the patient undergoes thoracentesis or other invasive procedures.
5. **Gastrointestinal complications:** The patient's use of an NG tube may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
6. **Respiratory failure:** The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate due to her pneumonia, leading to respiratory failure, which can result in intubation and mechanical ventilation.
7. **Sepsis:** The patient's pneumonia and other underlying conditions may lead to sepsis, which can result in multi-organ dysfunction and death.

**Recommendations:**

1. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
2. Continue antibiotics as prescribed and monitor for signs of pneumonia progression.
3. Consider thoracentesis if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates.
4. Monitor the patient's coagulopathy and bleeding complications closely.
5. Consider adjusting the patient's medication regimen to manage her cardiac conditions.
6. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely and consider adjusting her medication regimen if necessary.
7. Consider involving a speech-language pathologist (SLP) to evaluate the patient's swallowing function and develop a plan to prevent aspiration."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. A CT chest showed a right pleural effusion and bilateral infiltrate, likely due to aspiration. The patient has a NGT in place and is receiving infusions of vancomycin and piperacillin. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, and blood pressure of 146/55 mmHg. The patient is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and has a SpO2 of 99%.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the lack of assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and bilateral infiltrate on CT chest suggest a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated LDH and thrombocytopenia, which may indicate sepsis.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's abnormal coagulation profile may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Malnutrition: The patient's lack of enteral nutrition and elevated LDH may indicate malnutrition.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's slightly low potassium level may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's bilateral infiltrate on CT chest may indicate aspiration pneumonia.
7. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's DVT prophylaxis may be necessary to prevent pulmonary embolism.
8. Sepsis-induced organ dysfunction: The patient's anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated LDH may indicate sepsis-induced organ dysfunction.

Recommendations:

1. Continue oxygen therapy via nasal cannula.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely.
3. Consider initiating antibiotics for suspected aspiration pneumonia.
4. Administer DVT prophylaxis as prescribed.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely.
6. Consider initiating enteral nutrition.
7. Monitor the patient's coagulation profile closely.
8. Consider consulting with a pulmonologist or intensivist for further management."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo female with hx of AS, CAD s/p CABG and AVR on [**2138-7-29**]  presented
   to OSH on [**8-25**] with severe SOB and LLL collapse and left pleural
   effusion thought to be [**12-21**] MRSA PNA (OSH clx from [**9-4**]) discharged on
   [**9-10**] to rehab and now admitted from rehab with increasing DOE and
   cough (non productive).
   Pneumonia: recent MRSA pneumonia now with elevated WBC and concern for
   recurrent left sided effusion. Unclear whether this is an under treated
   MRSA PNA, new HCAP or new/chronic  aspiration event. An alternative
   explanation given the previous transudative effusion would be that it
   was a post CABG effusion. She also appears at very high risk given her
   weakness and inability to clear secretions to aspirate.
   - cover broadly for MRSA, GNR and anaerobes (Vanco and Pip-Tazo)
   - Deep suction
   - Chest CT (non contrast)
   PE: [**2138-1-18**], thought to be [**12-21**] immobilization. She remains at high
   risk for recurrent PE however she is currently supra-therapeutic.
   - Hold coumadin for now (will reverse with FFP if needed) for possible
   thoracentesis
   Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG:  there may be an element of
   decompensated fuction here with increased BNP. She had received
   diuresis in the ED and became hypotensive.  We will re-evaluate her
   cardiac function with TTE, it may be that she requires a gentler
   approach (ie IV lasix drip) to effect good diuresis.
   - TTE
   - Hold beta blocker and lasix for now (although she appears volume
   overloaded)
   - Cont ASA
   Atrial fibrillation: amiodarone (can convert to IV as needed),
   currently in sinus so will defer therapy for now. If NG tube placed
   then restart amiodarone.
   Swallowing: she is at very high risk for aspiration, will have her NPO
   for now until we can have SLP further evaluate her. In the mean time
   given the pooled secretions she will need an NG tube for feeding
   - NG tube
   - tube feeds
   - repeat SLP on [**9-29**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   effusion thought to be [**12-21**] MRSA PNA (OSH clx from [**9-4**]) discharged on
   [**9-10**] to rehab and now admitted from rehab with increasing DOE and
   cough (non productive).
   Pneumonia: recent MRSA pneumonia now with elevated WBC and concern for
   recurrent left sided effusion. Unclear whether this is an under treated
   MRSA PNA, new HCAP or new/chronic  aspiration event. An alternative
   explanation given the previous transudative effusion would be that it
   was a post CABG effusion. She also appears at very high risk given her
   weakness and inability to clear secretions to aspirate.
   - cover broadly for MRSA, GNR and anaerobes (Vanco and Pip-Tazo)
   - Deep suction
   - Chest CT (non contrast)
   PE: [**2138-1-18**], thought to be [**12-21**] immobilization. She remains at high
   risk for recurrent PE however she is currently supra-therapeutic.
   - Hold coumadin for now (will reverse with FFP if needed) for possible
   thoracentesis
   Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG:  there may be an element of
   decompensated fuction here with increased BNP. She had received
   diuresis in the ED and became hypotensive.  We will re-evaluate her
   cardiac function with TTE, it may be that she requires a gentler
   approach (ie IV lasix drip) to effect good diuresis.
   - TTE
   - Hold beta blocker and lasix for now (although she appears volume
   overloaded)
   - Cont ASA
   Atrial fibrillation: amiodarone (can convert to IV as needed),
   currently in sinus so will defer therapy for now. If NG tube placed
   then restart amiodarone.
   Swallowing: she is at very high risk for aspiration, will have her NPO
   for now until we can have SLP further evaluate her. In the mean time
   given the pooled secretions she will need an NG tube for feeding
   - NG tube
   - tube feeds

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) on [**2138-7-29**]. She presented to the emergency department on [**8-25**] with severe shortness of breath (SOB) and left lower lobe (LLL) collapse, and was found to have a left pleural effusion thought to be methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. She was discharged to rehabilitation on [**9-10**] but was readmitted due to increasing dyspnea and cough.

The patient is currently in the ICU with a right pleural effusion, bilateral infiltrate, and likely aspiration. She has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, and is being covered for MRSA, Gram-negative rods, and anaerobes. She is at high risk for recurrent left-sided effusion and aspiration due to her weakness and inability to clear secretions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent left-sided effusion: The patient's previous MRSA pneumonia and current bilateral infiltrate suggest a high risk for recurrent left-sided effusion.
2. Aspiration: The patient's weakness and inability to clear secretions make her at high risk for aspiration, which can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and even death.
3. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of CAD and recent CABG may increase her risk for cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's history of recent immobilization and current respiratory compromise make her at high risk for pulmonary embolism.
5. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's NG tube and tube feeds may increase her risk for gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
6. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and presence of central lines and other invasive devices make her at high risk for infection.
7. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory compromise and risk for aspiration make her at high risk for respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory arrest and death."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous cardiac surgery (CABG and AVR) who presented to the hospital with severe shortness of breath and left lower lobe (LLL) collapse. She was discharged to rehabilitation and readmitted with increasing dyspnea and cough. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, specifically MRSA pneumonia, and has elevated white blood cell count with MRSA and Gram-negative rods (GNR) on sputum culture.

The patient is at high risk for respiratory failure due to her underlying cardiac disease, recent cardiac surgery, and inability to clear secretions. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus rhythm. The patient's cardiac function is decompensated, and she has diastolic dysfunction.

The patient has a Swan-Ganz catheter inserted for hemodynamic monitoring and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for MRSA, GNR, and anaerobes. She is also receiving deep suction and will require a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line for intravenous therapy.

The patient has a high risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently receiving supratherapeutic anticoagulation. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and is receiving amiodarone, which may need to be converted to intravenous therapy as needed.

The patient is at high risk for aspiration due to her swallowing dysfunction and is being managed with a nasogastric tube and tube feeds. She will require further evaluation by a speech-language pathologist (SLP) to assess her swallowing function.

The patient's glycemic control is being managed with regular insulin sliding scale, and she is receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia and underlying cardiac disease.
2. Sepsis and septic shock due to MRSA and GNR infection.
3. Recurrent PE due to her history of PE and supratherapeutic anticoagulation.
4. Aspiration pneumonia due to her swallowing dysfunction.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias and decompensated cardiac function.
6. Infection of the PICC line due to prolonged use.
7. Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia due to insulin therapy.
8. Malnutrition and dehydration due to inadequate nutrition and fluid management.

Based on the patient's condition and risk factors, it is essential to continue monitoring her closely and adjusting her treatment plan as needed to prevent these potential complications."

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Ms. [**Known lastname 3383**] and discussed her case with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 424**],
   whose note above reflects my input.  This 84-year-old woman with a
   complicated cardiac history has improved somewhat with therapy but is
   still tenuous requiring close respiratory management, suctioning, etc.
   Her CT is consistent with pneumonia; when compared with prior CT, the
   effusion is much smaller, suggesting that it does not represent
   infection.  We will continue to treat for nosocomial pneumonia and hold
   off on thoracentesis.  For her history of PE, we are trying to bring
   her INR down into the usual therapeutic range with vitamin K.  Given
   the current level and no current evidence of bleeding, guidelines do
   not recommend more active reversal.  Other issues as per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 423**]

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   84 yo female with hx of AS, CAD s/p CABG and AVR on [**2138-7-29**]  presented
   to OSH on [**8-25**] with severe SOB and LLL collapse and left pleural
   effusion thought to be [**12-21**] MRSA PNA (OSH clx from [**9-4**]) discharged on
   [**9-10**] to rehab and now admitted from rehab with increasing DOE and
   cough (non productive, imaging consistent with PNA  and sputum with GNR
   and MRSA PNA.
   >Pneumonia: recent MRSA pneumonia now with elevated WBC with MRSA and
   GNR on sputum culture.  As regards her effusion  an alternative
   explanation given the previous transudative effusion would be that it
   was a post CABG effusion. She also appears at very high risk given her
   weakness and inability to clear secretions to aspirate.  Notably her
   WBC has improved since starting therapy and her left sided effusion is
   actually smaller in size then previous ([**8-25**])
   - cover broadly for MRSA, GNR and anaerobes (Vanco and Pip-Tazo) for a
   minimum of 14 day course. Day 1 = [**9-27**]
   - Deep suction
   - Will need PICC line [**9-29**] for IV course.
   >PE: [**2138-1-18**], thought to be [**12-21**] immobilization. She remains at high
   risk for recurrent PE however she is currently supra-therapeutic.
   - Hold coumadin for now
   - 2 days of Vit K starting [**9-28**] as she will likely need long term
   anti-coag
   >Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG:  there may be an element of
   decompensated fuction here with increased BNP. She had received
   diuresis in the ED and became hypotensive.  We will re-evaluate her
   cardiac function with TTE, it may be that she requires a gentler
   approach (ie IV lasix drip) to effect good diuresis as she has marked
   lower ext edema, however I think we can defer this until we see
   improvement in her infectious process.
   - TTE not done yet.
   - Hold beta blocker and lasix for now (although she appears volume
   overloaded). It may be reasonable to start low dose lasix tomorrow

   CRITICAL CARE STAFF ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Ms. [**Known lastname 3383**] and discussed her case with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 424**],
   whose note above reflects my input.  This 84-year-old woman with a
   complicated cardiac history has improved somewhat with therapy but is
   still tenuous requiring close respiratory management, suctioning, etc.
   Her CT is consistent with pneumonia; when compared with prior CT, the
   effusion is much smaller, suggesting that it does not represent
   infection.  We will continue to treat for nosocomial pneumonia and hold
   off on thoracentesis.  For her history of PE, we are trying to bring
   her INR down into the usual therapeutic range with vitamin K.  Given
   the current level and no current evidence of bleeding, guidelines do
   not recommend more active reversal.  Other issues as per Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 423**]
   note above.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 31**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2138-9-28**] 22:51 ------<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a complicated cardiac history, including a recent CABG and AVR procedure. She was admitted to the ICU with severe shortness of breath and left pleural effusion, which was initially thought to be MRSA pneumonia. However, the latest sputum culture shows both MRSA and GNR, indicating a polymicrobial infection.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and has a SpO2 of 99%. Her ABG shows pH 7.23, pCO2 32 mmHg, and pO2 64 mmHg.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a history of AS, CAD, and has undergone CABG and AVR procedures. Her current cardiac function is compromised, with elevated BNP levels and decreased ejection fraction.
* Infectious: The patient has a polymicrobial infection, including MRSA and GNR, which is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is 0.8 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 23 mg/dL.
* Hepatic: The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are within normal limits.
* Hematological: The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is 12.8 K/uL, and her platelet count is 248 K/uL.
* Neurological: The patient is alert and oriented, with no signs of neurological deficits.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is precarious, and she may require mechanical ventilation if her condition deteriorates.
2. Sepsis: The patient's polymicrobial infection increases her risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of AS and CAD, combined with her current cardiac compromise, increases her risk of developing cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate potential renal impairment, which can worsen if not managed promptly.
5. Hemorrhagic complications: The patient's anticoagulation therapy increases her risk of bleeding, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's risk of aspiration is high, and she may require tube feeds and suctioning to manage her gastrointestinal symptoms.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should be closely monitored and managed in the ICU, with regular assessments of her respiratory, cardiac, and renal status. Her antibiotic therapy should be adjusted based on the results of her sputum culture, and she should be considered for mechanical ventilation if her respiratory status deteriorates. Additionally, her anticoagulation therapy should be closely monitored to minimize the risk of bleeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo female with hx of AS, CAD s/p CABG and AVR on [**2138-7-29**]  presented
   to OSH on [**8-25**] with severe SOB and LLL collapse and left pleural
   effusion thought to be [**12-21**] MRSA PNA (OSH clx from [**9-4**]) discharged on
   [**9-10**] to rehab and now admitted from rehab with increasing DOE and
   cough (non productive).
   Pneumonia: recent MRSA pneumonia now with elevated WBC and concern for
   recurrent left sided effusion. Unclear whether this is an under treated
   MRSA PNA, new HCAP or new/chronic  aspiration event. An alternative
   explanation given the previous transudative effusion would be that it
   was a post CABG effusion. She also appears at very high risk given her
   weakness and inability to clear secretions to aspirate.
   - cover broadly for MRSA, GNR and anaerobes (Vanco and Pip-Tazo)
   - Deep suction
   - Chest CT (non contrast)
   PE: [**2138-1-18**], thought to be [**12-21**] immobilization. She remains at high
   risk for recurrent PE however she is currently supra-therapeutic.
   - Hold coumadin for now (will reverse with FFP if needed) for possible
   thoracentesis
   Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG:  there may be an element of
   decompensated fuction here with increased BNP. She had received
   diuresis in the ED and became hypotensive.  We will re-evaluate her
   cardiac function with TTE, it may be that she requires a gentler
   approach (ie IV lasix drip) to effect good diuresis.
   - TTE
   - Hold beta blocker and lasix for now (although she appears volume
   overloaded)
   - Cont ASA
   Atrial fibrillation: amiodarone (can convert to IV as needed),
   currently in sinus so will defer therapy for now. If NG tube placed
   then restart amiodarone.
   Swallowing: she is at very high risk for aspiration, will have her NPO
   for now until we can have SLP further evaluate her. In the mean time
   given the pooled secretions she will need an NG tube for feeding
   - NG tube
   - tube feeds
   - repeat SLP on [**9-29**]

Based on the patient's progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She presented to the hospital with severe shortness of breath and left lower lobe (LLL) collapse, and was found to have a left pleural effusion thought to be methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU with increasing dyspnea and cough, and is currently being treated for pneumonia with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 87 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 146/55 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds on the right base, and she has a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present. Her extremities are warm, with ecchymosis on the lower extremities. Her neurologic examination is normal, with the patient being attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, with a differential count of 96.1% neutrophils. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, and her troponin-T level is 0.06 ng/mL.

The patient's assessment and plan include coverage for MRSA, Gram-negative rods, and anaerobes, as well as deep suction and a chest computed tomography (CT) scan. The patient is also at high risk for recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently on supratherapeutic anticoagulation. The patient's cardiac function is being re-evaluated with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE), and her diuretic regimen is being adjusted.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Recurrent left-sided pleural effusion: The patient's recent MRSA pneumonia and elevated white blood cell count make it likely that she will experience recurrent pleural effusions.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is not fully treated, and she may experience further complications, such as respiratory failure or sepsis.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at high risk for recurrent PE, and may experience further complications, such as respiratory failure or cardiac arrest.
4. Cardiac decompensation: The patient's diastolic dysfunction and previous CABG may lead to cardiac decompensation, which can be life-threatening.
5. Aspiration: The patient's risk of aspiration is high, and she may experience further complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
6. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and elevated white blood cell count make it likely that she will experience sepsis, which can be life-threatening.

In conclusion, the patient is at high risk for various medical complications, and close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) on [**2138-7-29**]. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from rehabilitation due to increasing dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and cough.

The patient's current condition is complicated by recent MRSA pneumonia, left pleural effusion, and elevated white blood cell count with MRSA and Gram-negative rods (GNR) on sputum culture. She is at high risk for recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) and has a history of immobilization-related PE.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 87 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 146/55 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 25 inspirations per minute. Her oxygen saturation is 99% on nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin and cachectic appearance, poor dentition, and diminished breath sounds on both sides. Her abdominal examination is normal, and her neurologic examination shows her to be attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 9.5 g/dL
* Hematocrit: 28.9%
* Platelet count: 244 K/uL
* Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.06 ng/mL
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 23 mg/dL
* Serum creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
* Sodium: 140 mmol/L
* Potassium: 4.2 mmol/L
* Chloride: 109 mmol/L
* CO2: 29.6 mmol/L
* Albumin: 3.0 g/dL
* Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 517 IU/L
* Calcium: 9.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.2 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.6 mg/dL

The patient's respiratory culture shows moderate growth of oropharyngeal flora, yeast, and Gram-negative rods. Her blood and urine cultures are pending.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) due to her history of immobilization-related PE and current high risk factors.
2. Aspiration pneumonia due to her high risk of aspiration and inability to clear secretions.
3. Diastolic dysfunction and cardiac decompensation due to her history of CAD and recent MRSA pneumonia.
4. Respiratory failure due to her pneumonia and pleural effusion.
5. Sepsis and septic shock due to her pneumonia and Gram-negative rods on sputum culture.
6. Worsening of her left pleural effusion and potential need for thoracentesis or chest tube placement.
7. Potential need for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or cardiac catheterization due to her history of CAD.
8. Risk of bleeding due to her anticoagulation therapy and potential need for invasive procedures.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent and treat these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She presented to the emergency department with severe shortness of breath and left lower lobe (LLL) collapse, and was diagnosed with left pleural effusion thought to be methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. She was discharged to rehabilitation and readmitted with increasing dyspnea and cough. The patient has a sputum culture growing MRSA and gram-negative rods (GNR), and is at high risk for aspiration due to her weakness and inability to clear secretions.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with the following conditions:

* Pneumonia: MRSA and GNR on sputum culture
* Pleural effusion: thought to be post-CABG effusion
* Diastolic dysfunction/CAD: decompensated function with increased B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)
* Atrial fibrillation: currently in sinus rhythm
* Swallowing difficulty: at high risk for aspiration

The patient is being treated with:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam) for a minimum of 14 days
* Deep suctioning
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer
* Glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale
* Nutrition with Nutren Pulmonary (Full) through a nasogastric (NG) tube

Potential medical complications:

* Aspiration: high risk due to swallowing difficulty and inability to clear secretions
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): risk due to prolonged mechanical ventilation
* DVT: risk due to immobility and supra-therapeutic anticoagulation
* Diastolic dysfunction/CAD: risk of decompensation with increased BNP
* Atrial fibrillation: risk of embolization and stroke

Recommendations:

* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for a minimum of 14 days
* Continue deep suctioning and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer
* Monitor for signs of aspiration and VAP
* Consider repeat SLP evaluation on [**9-29**] to assess swallowing function
* Re-evaluate cardiac function with TTE to determine optimal diuresis approach
* Consider starting low-dose lasix tomorrow to effect diuresis
* Continue glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale
* Continue nutrition with Nutren Pulmonary (Full) through NG tube"

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) on [**2138-7-29**]. She presented to the hospital on [**8-25**] with severe shortness of breath and left lower lobe (LLL) collapse, and was diagnosed with left pleural effusion thought to be [**12-21**] methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pneumonia. She was discharged to rehabilitation and readmitted with increasing dyspnea and cough.

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with the following conditions:

* Pneumonia with MRSA and Gram-negative rods (GNR) on sputum culture
* Left-sided pleural effusion, which is smaller in size than previously
* Atrial fibrillation
* Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG with increased B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)
* Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance
* Swallowing difficulty with high risk of aspiration

The patient is being treated with:

* Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam) for a minimum of 14 days
* Deep suctioning
* Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Nasogastric (NG) tube for feeding and suctioning
* Regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control
* Supra-therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) for anticoagulation

Potential medical complications:

* Recurrent pneumonia due to MRSA and GNR
* Aspiration pneumonia due to swallowing difficulty
* Sepsis due to pneumonia and pleural effusion
* Cardiac complications due to diastolic dysfunction and CAD
* Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance due to inadequate fluid management
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and anticoagulation therapy
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Gastrointestinal complications due to NG tube and tube feeding."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   and MRSA PNA.
   >Pneumonia: recent MRSA pneumonia now with elevated WBC with MRSA and
   GNR on sputum culture.  As regards her effusion  an alternative
   explanation given the previous transudative effusion would be that it
   was a post CABG effusion. She also appears at very high risk given her
   weakness and inability to clear secretions to aspirate.  Notably her
   WBC has improved since starting therapy and her left sided effusion is
   actually smaller in size then previous ([**8-25**])
   - cover broadly for MRSA, GNR and anaerobes (Vanco and Pip-Tazo) for a
   minimum of 14 day course. Day 1 = [**9-27**]

   >PE: [**2138-1-18**], thought to be [**12-21**] immobilization. She remains at high
   risk for recurrent PE however she is currently supra-therapeutic.

   improvement in her infectious process.

Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR).
* She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe shortness of breath (SOB) and left lower lobe (LLL) collapse, and was diagnosed with pneumonia (PNA) due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram-negative rods (GNR).
* The patient has a left-sided pleural effusion, which is thought to be a post-CABG effusion rather than a transudative effusion.
* She has a high risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently supra-therapeutic on coumadin.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Aspiration: The patient is at high risk for aspiration due to her severe pneumonia, decreased level of consciousness, and inability to clear secretions.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and pleural effusion may lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's diastolic dysfunction and CAD may lead to decompensated heart failure, requiring aggressive diuresis and vasopressor support.
* Infection: The patient's pneumonia and pleural effusion may lead to bacteremia, sepsis, and septic shock.
* Thromboembolic events: The patient's high risk of recurrent PE and her current supra-therapeutic state on coumadin may lead to thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism.
* Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's inability to swallow and her high risk of aspiration may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
* Neurological complications: The patient's decreased level of consciousness and her high risk of aspiration may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.

**Plan:**

* Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for a minimum of 14 days to cover MRSA, GNR, and anaerobes.
* Deep suctioning to help clear secretions and reduce the risk of aspiration.
* Placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line) for IV antibiotic therapy.
* Hold coumadin for now and start vitamin K therapy to prepare for long-term anticoagulation.
* Re-evaluate cardiac function with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) to assess diastolic dysfunction and CAD.
* Hold beta blocker and lasix for now, but consider starting low-dose lasix tomorrow.
* Contain ASA and consider starting amiodarone for atrial fibrillation.
* Have the patient NPO until further evaluation by a speech-language pathologist (SLP).
* Repeat SLP on [**9-29**] to assess swallowing function."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   >Pneumonia: recent MRSA pneumonia now with elevated WBC with MRSA and
   GNR on sputum culture.  As regards her effusion  an alternative
   explanation given the previous transudative effusion would be that it
   was a post CABG effusion. She also appears at very high risk given her
   weakness and inability to clear secretions to aspirate.  Notably her
   WBC has improved since starting therapy and her left sided effusion is
   actually smaller in size then previous ([**8-25**])
   - cover broadly for MRSA, GNR and anaerobes (Vanco and Pip-Tazo) for a
   minimum of 14 day course. Day 1 = [**9-27**]
   - Deep suction
   - Will need PICC line [**9-29**] for IV course.
   >PE: [**2138-1-18**], thought to be [**12-21**] immobilization. She remains at high
   risk for recurrent PE however she is currently supra-therapeutic.
   - Hold coumadin for now
   - 2 days of Vit K starting [**9-28**] as she will likely need long term
   anti-coag
   >Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG:  there may be an element of
   decompensated fuction here with increased BNP. She had received
   diuresis in the ED and became hypotensive.  We will re-evaluate her
   cardiac function with TTE, it may be that she requires a gentler
   approach (ie IV lasix drip) to effect good diuresis as she has marked
   lower ext edema, however I think we can defer this until we see
   improvement in her infectious process.
   - TTE not done yet.
   - Hold beta blocker and lasix for now (although she appears volume
   overloaded). It may be reasonable to start low dose lasix tomorrow
   ([**9-29**])
   - Cont ASA
    Atrial fibrillation: amiodarone
   - Amiodarone by NG
    >Swallowing: she is at very high risk for aspiration, will have her
   NPO (s/p NG tube)  for now until we can have SLP further evaluate her.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She presented to the emergency department with severe shortness of breath and left lower lobe (LLL) collapse, and was found to have a left pleural effusion thought to be MRSA pneumonia. She was discharged to a rehabilitation center, but was readmitted with increasing dyspnea and cough. Imaging studies showed pneumonia, and sputum cultures grew MRSA and GNR. She is at high risk for aspiration due to her weakness and inability to clear secretions.

The patient has been treated with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for a minimum of 14 days. She has also been started on deep suction and will need a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line for IV antibiotics.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is taking amiodarone. She is at high risk for recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently supra-therapeutic with warfarin. Her cardiac function is being re-evaluated with a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), and she may require a gentler approach to diuresis.

The patient has a nasogastric (NG) tube and is NPO until further evaluation by a speech-language pathologist (SLP). She is at high risk for aspiration and will need close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration: The patient is at high risk for aspiration due to her weakness and inability to clear secretions. Close monitoring and suctioning are necessary to prevent aspiration.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of MRSA pneumonia, and it is essential to continue antibiotics for a minimum of 14 days to ensure adequate treatment.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is at high risk for recurrent PE due to her history of CAD and previous PE. Close monitoring and anticoagulation therapy are necessary to prevent further PEs.
4. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient has a history of CAD and may have diastolic dysfunction, which could lead to heart failure. Close monitoring of her cardiac function and diuresis is necessary.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is taking amiodarone. Close monitoring of her cardiac rhythm and function is necessary to prevent complications.
6. Swallowing Dysfunction: The patient has a history of swallowing dysfunction and is at high risk for aspiration. Close monitoring and suctioning are necessary to prevent aspiration.
7. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient is NPO and may be at risk for nutritional deficiencies. Close monitoring of her nutritional status and provision of enteral nutrition is necessary.
8. Infection: The patient has a history of MRSA pneumonia and may be at risk for further infections. Close monitoring of her infection status and provision of antibiotics as necessary is necessary."

   effusion recent admission for MRSA pneumonia now with worsening
   multifocal pneumonia (?recurrent aspiration) and ?decompensated CHF.
   1.   pneumonia.  Patient discharged last week for MRSA PNA.  Now with
   rising WBC and increasing secretions.  Respiratory status has improved
   with suctioning, vanco/zosyn.  Suspician for recurrent aspiration
   pneumonia.

   2.  History of PE.  Patient had PE in [**1-/2138**], thought [**12-21**]
   immobilization.  INR has been drifting down off coumadin.  Will restart
   coumadin in AM if INR < 3.0.
   - follow INR
   - consider resuming coumadin in AM
   3.  Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG.  There may be an element of
   decompensated fuction here with increased BNP. She had received
   diuresis in the ED and became hypotensive.  [**Month (only) 51**] ultimately need
   diuresis once lung disease stabilizes.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be inferred:

Summary:

The patient, an 84-year-old female, is a complex case with multiple comorbidities, including aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and recent sternotomy for aortic valve replacement. She was admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath, worsening multifocal pneumonia, and suspected recurrent aspiration pneumonia. The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is anticoagulated with coumadin. She has atrial fibrillation and is on amiodarone. The patient's respiratory status has improved with suctioning, vancomycin, and piperacillin-tazobactam, but she still requires mechanical ventilation and has ongoing secretions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Recurrent Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's worsening multifocal pneumonia and increasing secretions suggest a high risk of recurrent aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential sepsis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's ongoing pneumonia and suspected recurrent aspiration pneumonia put her at risk for developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and recent sternotomy for aortic valve replacement increase her risk of cardiac complications, such as decompensated heart failure, arrhythmias, and potential cardiac arrest.
4. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's history of pulmonary embolism and ongoing anticoagulation with coumadin increase her risk of developing another pulmonary embolism, which can lead to respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory compromise and requirement for mechanical ventilation increase her risk of developing respiratory failure, which can lead to further complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes.
6. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's recent sternotomy and ongoing anticoagulation with coumadin increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Infection: The patient's ongoing pneumonia and suspected recurrent aspiration pneumonia put her at risk for developing secondary infections, such as urinary tract infections or bloodstream infections, which can lead to further complications and potentially life-threatening outcomes.

Given the patient's complex medical history and ongoing respiratory compromise, it is essential to closely monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent or mitigate potential medical complications."

Based on the patient's daily progress note, the following information can be summarized:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, and has undergone suctioning requirements. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, and blood pressure of 109/31 mmHg. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 17.0, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 237 K/uL. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.1 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the patient's inability to respond to stimuli, and therefore, the following assessments were not made: peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and respiratory.

The patient has been diagnosed with impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, hypotension (not in shock), pneumonia, and aspiration. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition through a nasogastric tube, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's diagnosis of pneumonia and aspiration, there is a high risk of developing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and aspiration can worsen their respiratory status, leading to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia can lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's stress ulcer prophylaxis may not be sufficient to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
5. Renal failure: The patient's altered nutrition and fluid balance can lead to renal failure, which can worsen their overall prognosis.
6. Infection: The patient's impaired skin integrity and altered nutrition can increase their risk of developing infections, which can worsen their condition and outcome.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust their treatment plan accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and previous coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for shortness of breath, difficulty clearing secretions, and multifocal pneumonia with effusion. She has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and has received treatment with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. The patient has also been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus rhythm. She has been prescribed amiodarone, but therapy has been deferred for now. The patient has been placed on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and has a nasal cannula in place.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal pneumonia with effusion, which can lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and death if not properly treated.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a high risk of aspiration pneumonia due to her weak cough and difficulty clearing secretions, which can lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and death.
3. Diastolic dysfunction: The patient has been diagnosed with diastolic dysfunction, which can lead to heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and death if not properly managed.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, which can lead to stroke, heart failure, and death if not properly managed.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, which can lead to death if not properly managed.
6. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure, death, and prolonged hospitalization if not properly managed.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobility, which can lead to pulmonary embolism, death, and prolonged hospitalization if not properly managed.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcer due to her critical illness, which can lead to bleeding, death, and prolonged hospitalization if not properly managed.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to her prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, which can lead to respiratory failure, sepsis, and death if not properly managed.
10. Malnutrition: The patient is at risk for malnutrition due to her prolonged hospitalization, which can lead to prolonged recovery, increased risk of complications, and death if not properly managed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, an 84-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath, due to multifocal pneumonia, deep suctioning, and difficulty clearing secretions. She has a history of aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve replacement. Her current condition includes:

* Respiratory support: Nasal cannula oxygen delivery, with SpO2 of 100%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: T-max 36.8°C, T-current 36.6°C, HR 81 bpm, BP 109/31 mmHg
* Fluid balance: Total input 1,509 mL, total output 650 mL
* Laboratory results: WBC 17.0, Hct 28.9, Plt 244, Cr 1.0, TropT 0.06, Glucose 127
* Imaging studies: CT chest showing multifocal pneumonia, left pleural effusion, and moderate cardiomegaly
* Medications: Vancomycin, Piperacillin, PPI, Coumadin, and amiodarone

Potential medical complications:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's multifocal pneumonia and difficulty clearing secretions may lead to respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.
* Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and Gram-positive cocci on sputum Gram stain may lead to sepsis, requiring prompt treatment with antibiotics and close monitoring of vital signs.
* Cardiac decompensation: The patient's history of aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and diastolic dysfunction may lead to cardiac decompensation, requiring close monitoring of cardiac function and potential intervention with diuresis and vasopressors.
* Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, requiring close monitoring of stool and nasogastric tube output.
* Aspiration risk: The patient's difficulty clearing secretions and history of atrial fibrillation may increase the risk of aspiration, requiring close monitoring of swallowing function and potential intervention with a feeding tube.
* Deep vein thrombosis: The patient's immobilization and history of aortic stenosis may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis, requiring close monitoring of lower extremity circulation and potential intervention with anticoagulation therapy."

   TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
   prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is higher than expected
   for this type of prosthesis. Mild to moderate ([**11-20**]+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-8-4**], the
   gradient across the prosthetic aortic valve has increased and the
   aortic regurgitation is also increased. Estimated pulmonary artery
   pressure also increase. TEE may be recommended to further evaluate
   AVR.
   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo female with hx of AS, CAD s/p CABG and AVR on [**2138-7-29**]  presented
   to OSH on [**8-25**] with severe SOB and LLL collapse and left pleural
   effusion thought to be [**12-21**] MRSA PNA (OSH clx from [**9-4**]) discharged on
   [**9-10**] to rehab and now admitted from rehab with increasing DOE and
   cough (non productive, imaging consistent with PNA  and sputum with
   Klebsiella and MRSA PNA.. Her most recent course is complicated by the
   discovery of a high gradient across the AVR.
   >Pneumonia: recent MRSA pneumonia now with elevated WBC with MRSA and
   GNR on sputum culture.  As regards her effusion  an alternative
   explanation given the previous transudative effusion would be that it
   was a post CABG effusion. She also appears at very high risk given her
   weakness and inability to clear secretions to aspirate.  Notably her
   WBC has improved since starting therapy and her left sided effusion is
   actually smaller in size then previous ([**8-25**])
   - cover broadly for MRSA, GNR and anaerobes (Vanco and Pip-Tazo) for a
   minimum of 14 day course. Day 1 = [**9-27**]
   - Deep suction
   - Will need PICC line [**9-29**] for IV course.
   >PE: [**2138-1-18**], thought to be [**12-21**] immobilization. She remains at high
   risk for recurrent PE however she is currently supra-therapeutic.  Her
   PE has a reversible risk factor and with her current bleeding we feel
   comfortable that she has received an adequate cours, also she has
   marked increase in ecchymosis and a nose bleed requiring ENT so we will
   no longer anti-coagulate
   - No further role for anti-coagulation (and does not require from a
   valvular standpoint)
   - Cont Vitamin K for one additional day
   >Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG and AVR:  Her clinical exam and
   increased BNP are  consistent with the findings of TTE which shows
   increased gradient across the valve. We will d/w cardiac surgery
   regarding further diagnostic testing
   -- Hold beta blocker and lasix for now (although she appears volume
   overloaded). It may be reasonable to start low dose lasix tomorrow
   ([**9-29**])
   - Cont ASA
   > Nose bleed: [**12-21**] suction trauma, appreciate ENT input and packing.
   - Will cont to follow Hct, Plt and INR
   >Atrial fibrillation: amiodarone
   - Amiodarone by NG
   >Swallowing: she is at very high risk for aspiration, will have her NPO
   (s/p NG tube)  for now until we can have SLP further evaluate her.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female who has undergone cardiac surgery (CABG and AVR) and is currently admitted to the ICU due to worsening respiratory and cardiac symptoms. The patient has a history of AS, CAD, and AVR, and has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia, which is complicated by the discovery of a high gradient across the AVR.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has pneumonia, with MRSA and GNR on sputum culture. She has been treated with Vanco and Pip-Tazo, and has improved WBC count since starting therapy.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has a high gradient across the AVR, with mild to moderate aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation. She has also been diagnosed with diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG and AVR.
* Hemodynamic: The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.2°F, heart rate of 98 bpm, and blood pressure of 156/58 mmHg.
* Renal: The patient's creatinine level is 0.7 mg/dL, and her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 27 mEq/L.
* Neurological: The patient is alert and oriented, with normal tone and purposeful movement.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and high gradient across the AVR can lead to respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
* Cardiac failure: The patient's diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG and AVR can lead to cardiac failure, which can also be life-threatening.
* Sepsis: The patient's MRSA pneumonia and high gradient across the AVR can lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
* Thromboembolic events: The patient's history of PE and high gradient across the AVR can increase the risk of thromboembolic events, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).
* Aspiration: The patient's high risk for aspiration due to her pneumonia and high gradient across the AVR can lead to respiratory failure and death.
* Bleeding: The patient's history of nose bleed and high gradient across the AVR can increase the risk of bleeding, which can be life-threatening.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan should be implemented:

* Continue to treat the patient's pneumonia with Vanco and Pip-Tazo for a minimum of 14 days.
* Monitor the patient's vital signs and lab results closely, including creatinine and BUN levels.
* Consider consulting cardiac surgery regarding further diagnostic testing and treatment options for the patient's high gradient across the AVR.
* Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and provide supportive care as needed.
* Consider consulting ENT regarding further treatment options for the patient's nose bleed.
* Consider consulting SLP regarding further evaluation of the patient's swallowing ability and potential need for tube feeds."

   TTE: The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric
   left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and
   regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber
   size and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve
   prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is higher than expected
   for this type of prosthesis. Mild to moderate ([**11-20**]+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the
   severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
   The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2138-8-4**], the
   gradient across the prosthetic aortic valve has increased and the
   aortic regurgitation is also increased. Estimated pulmonary artery
   pressure also increase. TEE may be recommended to further evaluate
   AVR.
   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo female with hx of AS, CAD s/p CABG and AVR on [**2138-7-29**]  presented
   to OSH on [**8-25**] with severe SOB and LLL collapse and left pleural
   effusion thought to be [**12-21**] MRSA PNA (OSH clx from [**9-4**]) discharged on
   [**9-10**] to rehab and now admitted from rehab with increasing DOE and
   cough (non productive, imaging consistent with PNA  and sputum with
   Klebsiella and MRSA PNA.. Her most recent course is complicated by the
   discovery of a high gradient across the AVR.
   >Pneumonia: recent MRSA pneumonia now with elevated WBC with MRSA and
   GNR on sputum culture.  As regards her effusion  an alternative
   explanation given the previous transudative effusion would be that it
   was a post CABG effusion. She also appears at very high risk given her
   weakness and inability to clear secretions to aspirate.  Notably her
   WBC has improved since starting therapy and her left sided effusion is
   actually smaller in size then previous ([**8-25**])
   - cover broadly for MRSA, GNR and anaerobes (Vanco and Pip-Tazo) for a
   minimum of 14 day course. Day 1 = [**9-27**]
   - Deep suction
   - Will need PICC line [**9-29**] for IV course.
   >PE: [**2138-1-18**], thought to be [**12-21**] immobilization. She remains at high
   risk for recurrent PE however she is currently supra-therapeutic.  Her
   PE has a reversible risk factor and with her current bleeding we feel
   comfortable that she has received an adequate cours, also she has
   marked increase in ecchymosis and a nose bleed requiring ENT so we will
   no longer anti-coagulate
   - No further role for anti-coagulation (and does not require from a
   valvular standpoint)
   - Cont Vitamin K for one additional day
   >Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG and AVR:  Her clinical exam and
   increased BNP are  consistent with the findings of TTE which shows
   increased gradient across the valve. We will d/w cardiac surgery
   regarding further diagnostic testing
   -- Hold beta blocker and lasix for now (although she appears volume
   overloaded). It may be reasonable to start low dose lasix tomorrow
   ([**9-29**])
   - Cont ASA
   > Nose bleed: [**12-21**] suction trauma, appreciate ENT input and packing.
   - Will cont to follow Hct, Plt and INR
   >Atrial fibrillation: amiodarone
   - Amiodarone by NG
   >Swallowing: she is at very high risk for aspiration, will have her NPO
   (s/p NG tube)  for now until we can have SLP further evaluate her.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, an 84-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and recent cardiac surgery (CABG and AVR). She presented to the emergency department with severe shortness of breath and left lower lobe (LLL) collapse, and was diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia. She was discharged to rehabilitation and readmitted to the hospital with increasing dyspnea and cough. Her current course is complicated by a high gradient across the aortic valve replacement (AVR).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 98 beats per minute, blood pressure of 156/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a face tent.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin build, poor dentition, and a nasogastric (NG) tube. Her cardiovascular examination shows a normal sinus rhythm, and her peripheral vascular examination shows bilateral radial and dorsal pedal pulses. Her respiratory examination reveals crackles in the bases of both lungs. Her abdominal examination is soft and non-tender, and her extremities show ecchymosis.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.0 x 10^9/L, hemoglobin of 8.8 g/dL, platelet count of 244 x 10^9/L, and creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL. Her troponin-T level is 0.06 ng/mL, and her lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is 527 IU/L.

Imaging studies show a moderately dilated left atrium, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, and normal regional and global systolic function. The transaortic gradient is higher than expected for the type of prosthesis, and mild to moderate aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened, and mild mitral regurgitation is seen.

The patient's assessment and plan include coverage for MRSA, GNR, and anaerobes with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for at least 14 days. She will receive deep suction and a PICC line for IV antibiotics. She will also receive prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential medical complications that may arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's recent MRSA pneumonia may progress or recur, requiring adjustments to her antibiotic regimen.
2. Aortic valve dysfunction: The patient's high gradient across the AVR may indicate valve failure or stenosis, requiring further evaluation and potential intervention.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's history of CAD and recent cardiac surgery may increase her risk of cardiovascular instability, including arrhythmias and heart failure.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and respiratory failure may require mechanical ventilation and other respiratory support measures.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of bleeding and ecchymosis may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in the setting of anticoagulation therapy.
6. Infection: The patient's recent MRSA pneumonia and ecchymosis may increase her risk of infection, particularly with MRSA and GNR.
7. Renal failure: The patient's history of CAD and recent cardiac surgery may increase her risk of renal failure, particularly in the setting of hypotension and decreased cardiac output.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's history of cardiac surgery and recent bleeding may increase her risk of neurological complications, including stroke and seizures."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo female with hx of AS, CAD s/p CABG and AVR on [**2138-7-29**]  presented
   to OSH on [**8-25**] with severe SOB and LLL collapse and left pleural
   effusion thought to be [**12-21**] MRSA PNA (OSH clx from [**9-4**]) discharged on
   [**9-10**] to rehab and now admitted from rehab with increasing DOE and
   cough (non productive, imaging consistent with PNA  and sputum with GNR
   and MRSA PNA.
   >Pneumonia: recent MRSA pneumonia now with elevated WBC with MRSA and
   GNR on sputum culture.  As regards her effusion  an alternative
   explanation given the previous transudative effusion would be that it
   was a post CABG effusion. She also appears at very high risk given her
   weakness and inability to clear secretions to aspirate.  Notably her
   WBC has improved since starting therapy and her left sided effusion is
   actually smaller in size then previous ([**8-25**])
   - cover broadly for MRSA, GNR and anaerobes (Vanco and Pip-Tazo) for a
   minimum of 14 day course. Day 1 = [**9-27**]
   - Deep suction
   - Will need PICC line [**9-29**] for IV course.
   >PE: [**2138-1-18**], thought to be [**12-21**] immobilization. She remains at high
   risk for recurrent PE however she is currently supra-therapeutic.
   - Hold coumadin for now
   - 2 days of Vit K starting [**9-28**] as she will likely need long term
   anti-coag
   >Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG:  there may be an element of
   decompensated fuction here with increased BNP. She had received
   diuresis in the ED and became hypotensive.  We will re-evaluate her
   cardiac function with TTE, it may be that she requires a gentler
   approach (ie IV lasix drip) to effect good diuresis as she has marked
   lower ext edema, however I think we can defer this until we see
   improvement in her infectious process.
   - TTE not done yet.
   - Hold beta blocker and lasix for now (although she appears volume
   overloaded). It may be reasonable to start low dose lasix tomorrow

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from a rehabilitation facility with increasing dyspnea and cough.

The patient has a severe pneumonia, likely caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram-negative rods (GNR), as evidenced by sputum cultures. She also has a left pleural effusion, which may be a post-CABG effusion or a complication of her pneumonia.

The patient is at high risk for recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) and has been placed on warfarin therapy. However, her international normalized ratio (INR) is currently supra-therapeutic, and coumadin has been held. Vitamin K has been started for 2 days to reverse the effect of warfarin.

The patient has diastolic dysfunction and CAD, which may be contributing to her decreased cardiac function. She has been treated with diuresis in the emergency department (ED), but became hypotensive. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) has not been performed yet, but may be necessary to re-evaluate her cardiac function.

The patient is at high risk for aspiration due to her swallowing difficulties and has been placed on nothing by mouth (NPO) status. She has a nasogastric (NG) tube in place and is receiving tube feeds.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (Cr) levels. Her troponin-T level is elevated, indicating possible cardiac injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent PE: Given the patient's history of PE and her current risk factors, there is a high likelihood of recurrent PE.
2. Aspiration: The patient's swallowing difficulties and high risk of aspiration can lead to respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's diastolic dysfunction and CAD may lead to decreased cardiac function, heart failure, or arrhythmias.
4. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and pleural effusion make her at risk for developing secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid imbalance and diuresis may lead to fluid overload, which can exacerbate her cardiac and respiratory problems.
6. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's tube feeds may not be providing adequate nutrition, leading to malnutrition and compromised immune function.

Based on the patient's condition and potential complications, the following plan of care is recommended:

1. Continue antibiotic therapy for at least 14 days to cover MRSA, GNR, and anaerobes.
2. Perform a TTE to re-evaluate the patient's cardiac function and rule out cardiac complications.
3. Consider starting a gentle diuresis regimen, such as an IV lasix drip, to manage fluid overload and cardiac function.
4. Monitor the patient's swallowing function and consider a speech-language pathology (SLP) evaluation to assess her risk of aspiration.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results and adjust her treatment plan accordingly.
6. Consider transferring the patient to a rehabilitation facility or a long-term care facility for further management and rehabilitation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient, an 84-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with worsening multifocal pneumonia, suspected recurrent aspiration pneumonia, and decompensated CHF. She has a history of aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and recent admission for MRSA pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status has improved with suctioning, vancomycin, and zosyn, but she requires continued antibiotic therapy.

The patient has developed several medical complications, including:

1. Epistaxis: likely related to recurrent NT suctioning, treated with FFP and ENT packing.
2. Aortic stenosis: with increased gradient (doubled peak and mean since last echo), and mild AR. The CT team has been notified, and consideration is being given to TEE.
3. Diastolic dysfunction/CAD: s/p CABG, with AVR tight, and history of PE. The patient's INR has been drifting down off coumadin, and consideration is being given to holding long-term coumadin.
4. Atrial fibrillation: currently in sinus rhythm, on amiodarone, and anticoagulated with coumadin.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia: due to the patient's history of pneumonia and suspected recurrent aspiration.
2. Cardiac complications: related to the patient's aortic stenosis, diastolic dysfunction, and history of PE.
3. Bleeding complications: due to the patient's epistaxis and possible need for surgical intervention.
4. Respiratory failure: due to the patient's worsening pneumonia and decompensated CHF.
5. Infection: due to the patient's history of MRSA pneumonia and suspected recurrent aspiration pneumonia.

To address these potential complications, the patient's treatment plan includes:

1. Continued antibiotic therapy for pneumonia.
2. Management of aortic stenosis, including consideration of TEE and potential surgical intervention.
3. Monitoring of INR and consideration of holding long-term coumadin.
4. Management of atrial fibrillation, including continuation of amiodarone.
5. Swallowing evaluation and consideration of nasogastric tube feeding.
6. Monitoring of glycemic control and nutrition.
7. Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

   [**2138-7-29**] presented to OSH in [**Month (only) 1148**] with SOB, with L pleural effusion
   recent admission for MRSA pneumonia now with worsening multifocal
   pneumonia (?recurrent aspiration) and ?decompensated CHF.
   1.   pneumonia.  Patient discharged last week for MRSA PNA.  Now with
   rising WBC and increasing secretions.  Respiratory status has improved
   with suctioning, vanco/zosyn.  Suspician for recurrent aspiration
   pneumonia.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health status as follows:

The patient, an 84-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with worsening multifocal pneumonia, suspected recurrent aspiration pneumonia, and possible decompensated CHF. She has a history of AS, CAD, and CABG. Her current condition is characterized by:

* Pneumonia with rising WBC and increasing secretions
* Respiratory status improved with suctioning, vancomycin, and piperacillin-tazobactam
* Suspected recurrent aspiration pneumonia
* History of PE, with INR drifting down off coumadin
* Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG, with increased BNP
* Atrial fibrillation, anticoagulated with coumadin
* Swallowing difficulties, aspiration risk, and NPO status
* NG tube for feeding

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Recurrent aspiration pneumonia, leading to further respiratory compromise and potential sepsis
* Decompensated CHF, exacerbating respiratory and cardiac status
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization and potential coumadin therapy
* Stress ulcer and gastrointestinal bleeding due to prolonged NPO status and potential sepsis
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Sepsis and septic shock due to worsening pneumonia and potential multi-drug resistant organisms

Based on the patient's condition, the following interventions are recommended:

* Continue antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam
* Consider resuming coumadin therapy if INR is < 3.0
* Hold beta blocker and lasix until lung disease stabilizes
* Continue amiodarone therapy for atrial fibrillation
* Perform a thorough swallowing evaluation to assess aspiration risk
* Consider tube feeds and NG tube for feeding
* Monitor for signs of sepsis and septic shock
* Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis and DVT prophylaxis
* Continue to monitor and manage respiratory status, including oxygen delivery and ABG values."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo female with hx of AS, CAD s/p CABG and AVR on [**2138-7-29**]  presented
   to OSH on [**8-25**] with severe SOB and LLL collapse and left pleural
   effusion thought to be [**12-21**] MRSA PNA (OSH clx from [**9-4**]) discharged on
   [**9-10**] to rehab and now admitted from rehab with increasing DOE and
   cough (non productive, imaging consistent with PNA  and sputum with
   Klebsiella and MRSA PNA.. Her most recent course is complicated by the
   discovery of a high gradient across the AVR.
   >Pneumonia: recent MRSA pneumonia now with elevated WBC with MRSA and
   GNR on sputum culture.  As regards her effusion  an alternative
   explanation given the previous transudative effusion would be that it
   was a post CABG effusion. She also appears at very high risk given her
   weakness and inability to clear secretions to aspirate.  Notably her
   WBC has improved since starting therapy and her left sided effusion is
   actually smaller in size then previous ([**8-25**])
   - cover broadly for MRSA, GNR and anaerobes (Vanco and Pip-Tazo) for a
   minimum of 14 day course. Day 1 = [**9-27**]
   - Deep suction
   - Will need PICC line [**9-29**] for IV course.
   >PE: [**2138-1-18**], thought to be [**12-21**] immobilization. She remains at high
   risk for recurrent PE however she is currently supra-therapeutic.  Her
   PE has a reversible risk factor and with her current bleeding we feel
   comfortable that she has received an adequate cours, also she has
   marked increase in ecchymosis and a nose bleed requiring ENT so we will
   no longer anti-coagulate
   - No further role for anti-coagulation (and does not require from a
   valvular standpoint)
   - Cont Vitamin K for one additional day
    >Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG and AVR:  Her clinical exam and
   increased BNP are  consistent with the findings of TTE which shows
   increased gradient across the valve. We will d/w cardiac surgery
   regarding further diagnostic testing given her overall conditioning she
   would seem to be a poor candidate if surgery were deemed necessary. We
   will attempt gentle diuresis with lasix gtt today and aim for net
   negative goal. I do not think she can tolerate a TEE for further
   evaluation given her degree of respiratory compromise.
   -- Hold beta blocker and lasix for now (although she appears volume
   overloaded).
   - Cont ASA
   > Nose bleed: [**12-21**] suction trauma, appreciate ENT input and packing.
   - Will cont to follow Hct, Plt and INR
   >Atrial fibrillation: amiodarone
   - Amiodarone by NG
   >Swallowing: she is at very high risk for aspiration, will have her NPO
   (s/p NG tube)  for now until we can have SLP further evaluate her.
   - NG tube
   - tube feeds
   - Video swallow: cancel for now given over all poor prognosis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous cardiac surgery, including coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from a rehabilitation center with increasing dyspnea and cough, and was found to have pneumonia with MRSA and GNR on sputum culture. She also has a high gradient across the AVR, which is a complication of her recent course. The patient's condition is complicated by her weakness, inability to clear secretions, and high risk of aspiration.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, and blood pressure of 106/47 mmHg. Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via a face tent, with an SpO2 of 100%. Her physical examination reveals poor dentition, a nasogastric tube, and evidence of ecchymosis.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 244 K/uL. Her creatinine is 1.0 mg/dL, and her troponin-T is 0.06 ng/mL. Other lab results include elevated liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase.

The patient's plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotics for MRSA, GNR, and anaerobes, as well as deep suctioning and a PICC line for IV antibiotics. She will also require diuresis with lasix, and her beta blocker and lasix will be held for now. Her atrial fibrillation will be managed with amiodarone, and she will be NPO until further evaluation of her swallowing function.

Potential medical complications:

1. Aspiration: The patient is at high risk of aspiration due to her weakness, inability to clear secretions, and poor dentition.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has ongoing pneumonia with MRSA and GNR on sputum culture, which may lead to further respiratory compromise.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a high gradient across the AVR, which may lead to cardiac complications, including heart failure or arrhythmias.
4. Bleeding: The patient has marked ecchymosis and a recent nose bleed, which may indicate a bleeding diathesis.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is limited, and she may be at risk of respiratory failure if her pneumonia worsens or if she develops further respiratory compromise.
6. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and recent surgery may put her at risk of sepsis, which could lead to multi-organ failure.
7. Deep vein thrombosis: The patient is at high risk of deep vein thrombosis due to her immobility and recent surgery.
8. Stress ulcer: The patient's recent surgery and pneumonia may put her at risk of stress ulcer bleeding.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia: The patient's use of mechanical ventilation may increase her risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo female with hx of AS, CAD s/p CABG and AVR on [**2138-7-29**]  presented
   to OSH on [**8-25**] with severe SOB and LLL collapse and left pleural
   effusion thought to be [**12-21**] MRSA PNA (OSH clx from [**9-4**]) discharged on
   [**9-10**] to rehab and now admitted from rehab with increasing DOE and
   cough (non productive, imaging consistent with PNA  and sputum with
   Klebsiella and MRSA PNA.. Her most recent course is complicated by the
   discovery of a high gradient across the AVR.
   >Pneumonia: recent MRSA pneumonia now with elevated WBC with MRSA and
   GNR on sputum culture.  As regards her effusion  an alternative
   explanation given the previous transudative effusion would be that it
   was a post CABG effusion. She also appears at very high risk given her
   weakness and inability to clear secretions to aspirate.  Notably her
   WBC has improved since starting therapy and her left sided effusion is
   actually smaller in size then previous ([**8-25**])
   - cover broadly for MRSA, GNR and anaerobes (Vanco and Pip-Tazo) for a
   minimum of 14 day course. Day 1 = [**9-27**]
   - Deep suction
   - Will need PICC line [**9-29**] for IV course.
   >PE: [**2138-1-18**], thought to be [**12-21**] immobilization. She remains at high
   risk for recurrent PE however she is currently supra-therapeutic.  Her
   PE has a reversible risk factor and with her current bleeding we feel
   comfortable that she has received an adequate cours, also she has
   marked increase in ecchymosis and a nose bleed requiring ENT so we will
   no longer anti-coagulate
   - No further role for anti-coagulation (and does not require from a
   valvular standpoint)
   - Cont Vitamin K for one additional day
    >Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG and AVR:  Her clinical exam and
   increased BNP are  consistent with the findings of TTE which shows
   increased gradient across the valve. We will d/w cardiac surgery
   regarding further diagnostic testing given her overall conditioning she
   would seem to be a poor candidate if surgery were deemed necessary. We
   will attempt gentle diuresis with lasix gtt today and aim for net
   negative goal. I do not think she can tolerate a TEE for further
   evaluation given her degree of respiratory compromise.
   -- Hold beta blocker and lasix for now (although she appears volume
   overloaded).
   - Cont ASA
   > Nose bleed: [**12-21**] suction trauma, appreciate ENT input and packing.
   - Will cont to follow Hct, Plt and INR
   >Atrial fibrillation: amiodarone
   - Amiodarone by NG
   >Swallowing: she is at very high risk for aspiration, will have her NPO
   (s/p NG tube)  for now until we can have SLP further evaluate her.
   - NG tube
   - tube feeds
   - Video swallow: cancel for now given over all poor prognosis.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS), coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous cardiac surgery (CABG and AVR). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from a rehabilitation center with increasing dyspnea and cough. Her recent course is complicated by the discovery of a high gradient across the aortic valve. She has pneumonia, likely caused by MRSA and GNR, and a left pleural effusion. Her white blood cell count has improved since starting antibiotic therapy, and her left-sided effusion has decreased in size.

The patient has several medical conditions, including atrial fibrillation, diastolic dysfunction, and CAD. She has a high risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) and has been treated with anticoagulation therapy, but this has been discontinued due to bleeding. She has a high risk of aspiration due to her respiratory compromise and has been placed on a nasogastric tube.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory compromise and risk of aspiration make her susceptible to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's diastolic dysfunction, CAD, and high gradient across the aortic valve may lead to cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Pneumonia progression: The patient's pneumonia may progress and lead to sepsis or other complications.
4. Bleeding: The patient's bleeding risk is high due to her anticoagulation therapy and may worsen if she develops further bleeding complications.
5. Aspiration: The patient's risk of aspiration is high due to her respiratory compromise and may lead to pneumonia or other respiratory complications.
6. Cardiac surgery: The patient's cardiac condition may require surgical intervention, which carries risks and complications.
7. Thrombosis: The patient's anticoagulation therapy has been discontinued, and she may be at risk for thrombosis or embolism.

Recommendations:

1. Continue broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for pneumonia.
2. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider mechanical ventilation if necessary.
3. Manage the patient's cardiac condition with diuretics and other medications as needed.
4. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and consider platelet transfusions if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's aspiration risk and consider a video swallow study if her condition improves.
6. Consider cardiac surgery if the patient's cardiac condition worsens.
7. Monitor the patient's thrombotic risk and consider anticoagulation therapy if necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   84 yo female with hx of AS, CAD s/p CABG and AVR on [**2138-7-29**]  presented
   to OSH on [**8-25**] with severe SOB and LLL collapse and left pleural
   effusion thought to be [**12-21**] MRSA PNA (OSH clx from [**9-4**]) discharged on
   [**9-10**] to rehab and now admitted from rehab with increasing DOE and
   cough (non productive, imaging consistent with PNA  and sputum with
   Klebsiella and MRSA PNA.. Her most recent course is complicated by the
   discovery of a high gradient across the AVR.
   >Pneumonia: recent MRSA pneumonia now with elevated WBC with MRSA and
   GNR on sputum culture.  As regards her effusion  an alternative
   explanation given the previous transudative effusion would be that it
   was a post CABG effusion. She also appears at very high risk given her
   weakness and inability to clear secretions to aspirate.  Notably her
   WBC has improved since starting therapy and her left sided effusion is
   actually smaller in size then previous ([**8-25**])
   - cover broadly for MRSA, GNR and anaerobes (Vanco and Pip-Tazo) for a
   minimum of 14 day course. Day 1 = [**9-27**]
   - Deep suction
   - Will need PICC line [**9-29**] for IV course.
   >PE: [**2138-1-18**], thought to be [**12-21**] immobilization. She remains at high
   risk for recurrent PE however she is currently supra-therapeutic.  Her
   PE has a reversible risk factor and with her current bleeding we feel
   comfortable that she has received an adequate cours, also she has
   marked increase in ecchymosis and a nose bleed requiring ENT so we will
   no longer anti-coagulate
   - No further role for anti-coagulation (and does not require from a
   valvular standpoint)
   - Cont Vitamin K for one additional day
   >Diastolic dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG and AVR:  Her clinical exam and
   increased BNP are  consistent with the findings of TTE which shows
   increased gradient across the valve. We will d/w cardiac surgery
   regarding further diagnostic testing
   -- Hold beta blocker and lasix for now (although she appears volume
   overloaded). It may be reasonable to start low dose lasix tomorrow
   ([**9-29**])
   - Cont ASA
   > Nose bleed: [**12-21**] suction trauma, appreciate ENT input and packing.
   - Will cont to follow Hct, Plt and INR
   >Atrial fibrillation: amiodarone
   - Amiodarone by NG
   >Swallowing: she is at very high risk for aspiration, will have her NPO
   (s/p NG tube)  for now until we can have SLP further evaluate her.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) on July 29, [**2138**]. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from rehabilitation due to increasing dyspnea and cough.

The patient has a high risk of medical complications, including:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a recent MRSA pneumonia, and her sputum culture shows MRSA and Gram-negative rods (GNR). She requires broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for at least 14 days.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of immobilization and is at high risk for recurrent DVT. However, she is currently supra-therapeutic, and her bleeding risk is increased, so anti-coagulation therapy is being discontinued.
3. Diastolic Dysfunction/CAD s/p CABG and AVR: The patient's clinical exam and increased B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are consistent with the findings of transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE), which shows an increased gradient across the valve. Further diagnostic testing is needed.
4. Nasal Bleed: The patient has a history of suction trauma and requires packing and close monitoring.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is being treated with amiodarone.
6. Swallowing: The patient is at high risk for aspiration and is being kept NPO until further evaluation by a speech-language pathologist (SLP).
7. Fluid Overload: The patient appears volume overloaded and may require diuresis.
8. Gastrointestinal (GI) Issues: The patient has a history of GI bleeding and may require close monitoring.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 98.6°F (37°C), heart rate of 88 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 106/47 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a face tent. Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via a face tent, and her ABG results are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination is notable for poor dentition, a nasogastric (NG) tube, and ecchymosis on her extremities. Her neurological examination is normal, with the patient being attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.3 g/dL
* White Blood Cell Count (WBC): 17.0 x 10^9/L
* Platelet Count (Plt): 244 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine (Cr): 1.0 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.06 ng/mL
* Glucose: 127 mg/dL
* Albumin: 2.8 g/dL
* Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH): 527 IU/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 9.3 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.3 mg/dL
* Phosphate (PO4): 2.8 mg/dL

The patient's diagnosis is complicated by the discovery of a high gradient across the AVR, which may require further diagnostic testing. The patient's treatment plan includes broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, deep suction, and placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and previous cardiac surgeries. She was admitted with MRSA pneumonia and suspected recurrent aspiration pneumonia. She has been receiving antibiotics and is being managed for hypoxia and respiratory distress. She has also been experiencing epistaxis, likely related to recurrent NT suctioning, and has been receiving blood products and vitamin K. She has a history of PE and has been on coumadin, which has been held due to epistaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is worsening, and she is at risk for further complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, and death.
2. Aspiration: The patient's aspiration risk is high due to her pneumonia and difficulty clearing secretions. She is at risk for further aspiration episodes, which could lead to respiratory failure and death.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's aortic stenosis is worsening, and she is at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
4. Bleeding: The patient's epistaxis is a concern, and she is at risk for further bleeding complications, including intracranial hemorrhage.
5. Thrombosis: The patient's history of PE and her current anticoagulation status make her at risk for thrombosis, particularly in the setting of her worsening cardiac condition.
6. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and epistaxis make her at risk for further infection, particularly in the setting of her compromised immune system.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to eat and her need for tube feeds make her at risk for malnutrition, which could further compromise her already compromised immune system.
8. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening pneumonia and respiratory distress make her at risk for respiratory failure, which could lead to death.
9. Cardiac arrest: The patient's cardiac condition and her history of cardiac surgery make her at risk for cardiac arrest, particularly in the setting of her worsening cardiac condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue antibiotics and antifungal therapy to treat the patient's pneumonia.
2. Manage the patient's aspiration risk by providing suctioning and ensuring that her airway is secure.
3. Monitor the patient's cardiac condition closely and consider further cardiac interventions, such as TEE, to evaluate the patient's cardiac function.
4. Continue to manage the patient's bleeding risk by monitoring her INR and platelet count and adjusting her anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
5. Consider further diagnostic testing, such as a CT scan or echocardiogram, to evaluate the patient's cardiac condition and potential complications.
6. Continue to provide supportive care, including oxygen therapy, ventilatory support, and diuresis, as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's nutritional status closely and consider further nutritional support, such as total parenteral nutrition, if necessary.
8. Consider further interventions, such as thoracentesis, to manage the patient's pleural effusions and respiratory distress."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current condition as follows:

The patient, an 84-year-old female, is admitted to the ICU with worsening multifocal pneumonia, likely recurrent aspiration pneumonia, and decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF). She has a history of aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and has undergone cardiac bypass surgery and aortic valve replacement (AVR) previously. The patient is also experiencing epistaxis, likely related to recurrent nasal tube suctioning, and has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 88 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 106/47 mmHg. She is receiving oxygen therapy via a face tent and has a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's respiratory status has improved with suctioning and antibiotic therapy.

Laboratory results show a rising white blood cell count (WBC) and increasing secretions. Sputum cultures have grown MRSA and pan-sensitive Klebsiella. The patient is being treated with a 14-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) to cover recurrent MRSA, Klebsiella, and other uncultured organisms.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia: The patient's swallowing function is compromised, and she is at risk of developing recurrent aspiration pneumonia.
2. Cardiovascular instability: The patient's aortic stenosis and decompensated CHF may lead to cardiovascular instability and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Bleeding complications: The patient's epistaxis and history of PE may increase the risk of bleeding complications, particularly if her international normalized ratio (INR) is not properly managed.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure.
5. Septic shock: The patient's sepsis and pneumonia may progress to septic shock, which can be life-threatening.
6. Aortic valve failure: The patient's AVR may fail, leading to aortic valve regurgitation and potentially life-threatening complications.
7. Intubation and mechanical ventilation: The patient may require intubation and mechanical ventilation if her respiratory status deteriorates, which carries its own set of risks and complications.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's inability to swallow and her need for tube feeding may lead to nutritional deficiencies, which can exacerbate her underlying medical conditions.

Given the patient's complex medical condition and potential complications, close monitoring and management by the ICU team are essential to prevent or mitigate these complications and ensure the patient's optimal care."
