   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose and seizure.
   .
   #. Metabolic Acidosis:  Lactic acidosis secondary to metformin
   ingestion.  The patient yesterday had evidence of a non-gap acidosis as
   well, which has since resolved since we have discontinued NS and used
   D5W with bicarb instead for volume resuscitation.  Will continue to
   hold NS as will worsen acidosis by increasing chloride.
   - Currently off bicarbonate drip, but will trend ABG and if worsening
   acidosis, can restart
   - The patient underwent CVVH last night, but filter clotted, most
   likely will need to restart today, see below.
   - Vent settings better tolerated with sedation, off paralytics,
   continue to wean sedation
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to overdose and metabolic
   acidosis.  Currently on three pressors, will wean as tolerated.
 TTE
   did not show evidence of cardiac failure
   - Continue neo/levophed/dopa and wean as tolerated
   - treating o/d as above
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved
   - Holding off on antibiotics for now, but will start empirically if
   patient spikes a temp
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Bronch likely today
   - Continue to oxygenate with increased PEEP and FiO2, attempt to wean
   as tolerated
   - Off paralytics, wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain.  Most likely secondary
   to lactic acidosis.  BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. In setting of hypotension ATN is an obvious concern.
   - follow UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Will likely need to restart CVVH as improved initially with dialysis,
   but now worsening Crn.
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   .
   #. h/o seizure:  ? Related to overdose. No evidence for CNS infection.
   - Seizure precautions, attempt to obtain further records, will need
   neuro f/u
   - Need to clarify EtoH history
   .
   #. Elevated PTT:  Resolved.  In setting of normal INR - ?heparin
   exposure, consider lupus anticoagulant or vWF. No bleeding.
   - trend INR/PTT
   - active type and screen
   .
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus:
   - Holding metformin given recent ingestion
   - discontinued insulin drip yesterday, as no evidence of CCB
   ingestion.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   .
   #. HTN
   - Holding antihypertensives while hypotensive
   .
   #. Psych:
   - On board, will follow when patient awake
   - Will attempt to get in touch with outpatient psychiatrist

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following

   .
   #. Metabolic Acidosis:  Lactic acidosis secondary to metformin
   ingestion.  The patient yesterday had evidence of a non-gap acidosis as
   well, which has since resolved since we have discontinued NS and used
   D5W with bicarb instead for volume resuscitation.  Will continue to
   hold NS as will worsen acidosis by increasing chloride.
   - Currently off bicarbonate drip, but will trend ABG and if worsening
   acidosis, can restart
   - The patient underwent CVVH last night, but filter clotted, most
   likely will need to restart today, see below.
   - Vent settings better tolerated with sedation, off paralytics,
   continue to wean sedation
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to overdose and metabolic
   acidosis.  Currently on three pressors, will wean as tolerated.
 TTE
   did not show evidence of cardiac failure
   - Continue neo/levophed/dopa and wean as tolerated
   - treating o/d as above
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved
   - Holding off on antibiotics for now, but will start empirically if
   patient spikes a temp
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Bronch likely today
   - Continue to oxygenate with increased PEEP and FiO2, attempt to wean
   as tolerated
   - Off paralytics, wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain.  Most likely secondary
   to lactic acidosis.  BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. In setting of hypotension ATN is an obvious concern.
   - follow UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Will likely need to restart CVVH as improved initially with dialysis,
   but now worsening Crn.
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   .
   #. h/o seizure:  ? Related to overdose. No evidence for CNS infection.
   - Seizure precautions, attempt to obtain further records, will need
   neuro f/u
   - Need to clarify EtoH history
   .
   #. Elevated PTT:  Resolved.  In setting of normal INR - ?heparin
   exposure, consider lupus anticoagulant or vWF. No bleeding.
   - trend INR/PTT
   - active type and screen
   .
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus:
   - Holding metformin given recent ingestion
   - discontinued insulin drip yesterday, as no evidence of CCB
   ingestion.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   .

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU after an overdose and seizure. He has a history of depression, diabetes, and hypertension. He is currently intubated and sedated, and is receiving mechanical ventilation and multiple pressors to support his blood pressure. He has metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to metformin ingestion, and is being treated with bicarbonate infusions. He also has acute renal failure, likely secondary to lactic acidosis, and is being treated with CVVH. He has leukocytosis, likely secondary to stress response, and is being monitored for signs of infection. He has a history of seizure, and is being monitored for further seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Worsening of metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely to worsen if he continues to receive normal saline infusions, which will increase his chloride levels and worsen his acidosis.
2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's acute kidney injury is likely to worsen if he continues to receive CVVH, which may not be effective in removing his waste products.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis may be a sign of infection, and he may require further evaluation and treatment for infection.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he continues to receive mechanical ventilation, and he may require further evaluation and treatment for respiratory failure.
5. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if he continues to receive pressors, and he may require further evaluation and treatment for hypotension.
6. Seizure: The patient's history of seizure may increase his risk of further seizures, and he may require further evaluation and treatment for seizure prophylaxis.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if he continues to lose blood, and he may require further evaluation and treatment for anemia.
8. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte imbalance may worsen if he continues to receive CVVH, which may not be effective in removing his electrolytes.
9. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if he continues to receive levothyroxine, and he may require further evaluation and treatment for hypothyroidism.
10. Psychiatric complications: The patient's psychiatric history may increase his risk of psychiatric complications, such as depression and anxiety, and he may require further evaluation and treatment for psychiatric complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose and seizure.
   .
   1. Overdose
   Known ingestions include metformin and levothyroxine as well as unknown
   depressants. Concern for possible TCA o/d.
   - will attempt to contact outside treaters and obtain accurate med list
   - serial ABG and EKGs
   - bicarb drip
   - LFTs WNL, no evidence for tylenol intake holding on NAC
   - follow up toxicology recommendations
   - psychiatric and social work consults. needs 1:1 when awake.
   .
   2. Hypotension
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to overdose, potentially TCA. Not bradycardic to
   suggest beta blocker overdose, no history of CCB use. Infection seems
   less likely - could have SIRS however following aspiration. Does not
   appear to be volume depleted at this point. Patient does have history
   of depressed EF (uncertain cause based on available records) but think
   cardiogenic shock less likely.
   - TTE
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Continue neo/levophed
   - treating o/d as above
   .
   3. h/o aspiration
   Patient had witnessed aspiration following administration of charcoal.
   Probably has an aspiration pneumonitis
   - Holding off on antibiotics for now
   - Bronch when stabilized, check sputum
   .
   4. Hypoxia
   Possible evolving ARDS in setting of aspiration
   - Increase PEEP
   .
   4. h/o seizure
   ? Related to overdose. No evidence for CNS infection.
   - Seizure precautions, attempt to obtain further records, will need
   neuro f/u
   - Need to clarify EtoH history
   .
   5. Acidosis
   He has evidence for a gap and non gap (hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis). Metabolic acidosis present in the setting of elevated
   lactate, potentially metformin related but would also consider
   infection. DKA less likely. Nongap acidosis probably secondary to NS
   resuscitation.
   - bicarbonate drip as above
   - serial ABGs
   - renal recommendations appreciated ?CVVH
   - Titrate up sedation for better synchroncy with vent, incr RR
   .
   6. Leukocytosis
   Most likely secondary to stress response / post seizure, but in setting
   of lactic acidosis also need to rule out infection.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures, check sputum
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   7. Acute renal failure
   Baseline Cr uncertain. BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. In setting of hypotension ATN is an obvious concern.
   - UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - renal re ?CVVH
   .
   8. Elevated PTT
   In setting of normal INR - ?heparin exposure, consider lupus
   anticoagulant or vWF. No bleeding.
   - trend INR/PTT
   - type and screen
   .
   9. Anemia
   Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   .
   10. Diabetes mellitus
   - Hold metformin
   - Insulin drip target <150
   .
   11. Hypothyroidism
   - hold levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   .
   12. HTN
   - Holding antihypertensives while hypotensive

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose and seizure.
   .
   1. Overdose
   Known ingestions include metformin and levothyroxine as well as unknown
   depressants. Concern for possible TCA o/d.
   - will attempt to contact outside treaters and obtain accurate med list
   - serial ABG and EKGs
   - bicarb drip
   - LFTs WNL, no evidence for tylenol intake holding on NAC
   - follow up toxicology recommendations
   - psychiatric and social work consults. needs 1:1 when awake.
   .
   2. Hypotension
   [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to overdose, potentially TCA. Not bradycardic to
   suggest beta blocker overdose, no history of CCB use. Infection seems
   less likely - could have SIRS however following aspiration. Does not
   appear to be volume depleted at this point. Patient does have history
   of depressed EF (uncertain cause based on available records) but think
   cardiogenic shock less likely.
   - TTE
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Continue neo/levophed
   - treating o/d as above
   .
   3. h/o aspiration
   Patient had witnessed aspiration following administration of charcoal.
   Probably has an aspiration pneumonitis
   - Holding off on antibiotics for now
   - Bronch when stabilized, check sputum
   .
   4. Hypoxia
   Possible evolving ARDS in setting of aspiration
   - Increase PEEP
   .
   4. h/o seizure
   ? Related to overdose. No evidence for CNS infection.
   - Seizure precautions, attempt to obtain further records, will need
   neuro f/u
   - Need to clarify EtoH history
   .
   5. Acidosis
   He has evidence for a gap and non gap (hyperchloremic metabolic
   acidosis). Metabolic acidosis present in the setting of elevated
   lactate, potentially metformin related but would also consider
   infection. DKA less likely. Nongap acidosis probably secondary to NS
   resuscitation.
   - bicarbonate drip as above
   - serial ABGs
   - renal recommendations appreciated ?CVVH
   - Titrate up sedation for better synchroncy with vent, incr RR
   .
   6. Leukocytosis
   Most likely secondary to stress response / post seizure, but in setting
   of lactic acidosis also need to rule out infection.
   - f/u blood and urine cultures, check sputum
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   7. Acute renal failure
   Baseline Cr uncertain. BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. In setting of hypotension ATN is an obvious concern.
   - UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - renal re ?CVVH
   .
   8. Elevated PTT
   In setting of normal INR - ?heparin exposure, consider lupus
   anticoagulant or vWF. No bleeding.
   - trend INR/PTT
   - type and screen
   .
   9. Anemia
   Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   .
   10. Diabetes mellitus
   - Hold metformin
   - Insulin drip target <150
   .
   11. Hypothyroidism
   - hold levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   .
   12. HTN
   - Holding antihypertensives while hypotensive

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1). Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.
   - Start Unasyn for aspiration pneumonia in spikes
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Continue to oxygenate with increased PEEP and FiO2, attempt to wean
   as tolerated
   - Off paralytics, wean sedation as tolerated
   2). Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to overdose and metabolic
   acidosis.  Currently on levophed only.  Will wean as tolerated.
 TTE
   did not show evidence of cardiac failure
   - Continue levophed and wean as tolerated
   - Give fluid bolus for pressor wean stall
   3. Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   #. Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain.  Most likely secondary
   to lactic acidosis.  BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. Urine output improving after CVVH.
   - follow UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Will likely need to restart CVVH as improved initially with dialysis,
   but now worsening Crn.
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   #. Psych:
   - On board, will follow when patient awake
   - Will attempt to get in touch with outpatient psychiatrist

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1). Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.
   - Start Unasyn for aspiration pneumonia in spikes
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Continue to oxygenate with increased PEEP and FiO2, attempt to wean
   as tolerated
   - Off paralytics, wean sedation as tolerated
   2). Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to overdose and metabolic
   acidosis.  Currently on levophed only.  Will wean as tolerated.
 TTE
   did not show evidence of cardiac failure
   - Continue levophed and wean as tolerated
   - Give fluid bolus for pressor wean stall
   3. Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   #. Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain.  Most likely secondary
   to lactic acidosis.  BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. Urine output improving after CVVH.
   - follow UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Will likely need to restart CVVH as improved initially with dialysis,
   but now worsening Crn.
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   #. Psych:
   - On board, will follow when patient awake
   - Will attempt to get in touch with outpatient psychiatrist
   FEN: NPO for now, IVF as needed for BP

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU after an overdose of metformin and possibly a calcium channel blocker, followed by a seizure. He remains intubated and sedated. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 40 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 130/51 mmHg. He has a mixed venous oxygen saturation of 67%. His respiratory support includes a ventilator with a tidal volume of 650 mL and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. His laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient had witnessed aspiration following administration of charcoal, which may have caused an aspiration pneumonitis.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be secondary to the overdose and metabolic acidosis.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient had a metabolic acidosis, which has resolved, but he may still require close monitoring.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute kidney injury, which may be secondary to lactic acidosis or another underlying cause.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may be secondary to stress response or post-seizure, but it also needs to be ruled out as a sign of infection.
6. Anemia: The patient has mild anemia, with an unknown baseline.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which may be related to the overdose.
8. Psychiatric Complications: The patient has a history of depression and may require psychiatric evaluation and treatment.
9. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory support is complex, and he may be at risk for respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
10. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiovascular status is stable, but he may be at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his multiple medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a multi-lumen central venous catheter (CVC) and is being treated for acute kidney injury (AKI) and sepsis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 40 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 130/51 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is also stable, with a tidal volume of 650 mL and a respiratory rate of 21 inspirations per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 95% on 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2).

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 20.7, a hemoglobin level of 11.1 g/dL, and a platelet count of 243. The patient's creatinine level is 2.5 mg/dL, and the patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level is 22 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies show a chest x-ray (CXR) with bilateral infiltrates and a CXR with a left lower lobe infiltrate.

The patient's microbiology results are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) with worsening creatinine level and BUN level.
2. Sepsis with potential for multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with potential for respiratory failure.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with potential for pulmonary embolism.
5. Stress ulcer with potential for gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Malnutrition with potential for delayed wound healing and increased risk of infection.
7. Hypoglycemia with potential for neurological damage.
8. Hypocalcemia with potential for cardiac arrhythmias.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose and seizure.
   .
   #. Metabolic Acidosis:  Lactic acidosis secondary to metformin
   ingestion.  The patient yesterday had evidence of a non-gap acidosis as
   well, which has since resolved since we have discontinued NS and used
   D5W with bicarb instead for volume resuscitation.  Will continue to
   hold NS as will worsen acidosis by increasing chloride.
   - Currently off bicarbonate drip, but will trend ABG and if worsening
   acidosis, can restart
   - The patient underwent CVVH last night, but filter clotted, most
   likely will need to restart today, see below.
   - Vent settings better tolerated with sedation, off paralytics,
   continue to wean sedation
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to overdose and metabolic
   acidosis.  Currently on three pressors, will wean as tolerated.
 TTE
   did not show evidence of cardiac failure
   - Continue neo/levophed/dopa and wean as tolerated
   - treating o/d as above
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved
   - Holding off on antibiotics for now, but will start empirically if
   patient spikes a temp
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Bronch likely today
   - Continue to oxygenate with increased PEEP and FiO2, attempt to wean
   as tolerated
   - Off paralytics, wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain.  Most likely secondary
   to lactic acidosis.  BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. In setting of hypotension ATN is an obvious concern.
   - follow UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Will likely need to restart CVVH as improved initially with dialysis,
   but now worsening Crn.
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   .
   #. h/o seizure:  ? Related to overdose. No evidence for CNS infection.
   - Seizure precautions, attempt to obtain further records, will need
   neuro f/u
   - Need to clarify EtoH history
   .
   #. Elevated PTT:  Resolved.  In setting of normal INR - ?heparin
   exposure, consider lupus anticoagulant or vWF. No bleeding.
   - trend INR/PTT
   - active type and screen
   .
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus:
   - Holding metformin given recent ingestion
   - discontinued insulin drip yesterday, as no evidence of CCB
   ingestion.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   .
   #. HTN
   - Holding antihypertensives while hypotensive
   .
   #. Psych:
   - On board, will follow when patient awake
   - Will attempt to get in touch with outpatient psychiatrist

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose and seizure.
   .
   #. Metabolic Acidosis:  Lactic acidosis secondary to metformin
   ingestion.  The patient yesterday had evidence of a non-gap acidosis as
   well, which has since resolved since we have discontinued NS and used
   D5W with bicarb instead for volume resuscitation.  Will continue to
   hold NS as will worsen acidosis by increasing chloride.
   - Currently off bicarbonate drip, but will trend ABG and if worsening
   acidosis, can restart
   - The patient underwent CVVH last night, but filter clotted, most
   likely will need to restart today, see below.
   - Vent settings better tolerated with sedation, off paralytics,
   continue to wean sedation
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Most likely secondary to overdose and metabolic
   acidosis.  Currently on three pressors, will wean as tolerated.
 TTE
   did not show evidence of cardiac failure
   - Continue neo/levophed/dopa and wean as tolerated
   - treating o/d as above
   .
   #.  Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved
   - Holding off on antibiotics for now, but will start empirically if
   patient spikes a temp
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Bronch likely today
   - Continue to oxygenate with increased PEEP and FiO2, attempt to wean
   as tolerated
   - Off paralytics, wean sedation as tolerated
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   .
   #. Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain.  Most likely secondary
   to lactic acidosis.  BUN/Cr<20:1 less consistent with a pre-renal
   etiology. In setting of hypotension ATN is an obvious concern.
   - follow UA, urine lytes
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Will likely need to restart CVVH as improved initially with dialysis,
   but now worsening Crn.
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   .
   #. h/o seizure:  ? Related to overdose. No evidence for CNS infection.
   - Seizure precautions, attempt to obtain further records, will need
   neuro f/u
   - Need to clarify EtoH history
   .
   #. Elevated PTT:  Resolved.  In setting of normal INR - ?heparin
   exposure, consider lupus anticoagulant or vWF. No bleeding.
   - trend INR/PTT
   - active type and screen
   .
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   .
   #. Diabetes mellitus:
   - Holding metformin given recent ingestion
   - discontinued insulin drip yesterday, as no evidence of CCB
   ingestion.
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   .
   #. HTN
   - Holding antihypertensives while hypotensive
   .
   #. Psych:
   - On board, will follow when patient awake
   - Will attempt to get in touch with outpatient psychiatrist

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of depression who presented to the ICU following an overdose and seizure. He has been intubated and sedated, and is receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 15 cmH2O. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 40 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. He has a mixed venous oxygen saturation of 67% and a lactate level of 2.4 mmol/L, indicating a metabolic acidosis.

The patient has been diagnosed with lactic acidosis secondary to metformin ingestion, and is being treated with D5W with bicarbonate to correct the acidosis. He also has hypotension, which is likely secondary to the overdose and metabolic acidosis, and is being treated with three pressors. He has hypoxic respiratory failure, which is being treated with increased PEEP and FiO2, and is being considered for bronchoscopy. He has leukocytosis, which is likely secondary to stress response and post-seizure, and is being monitored for signs of infection. He has acute renal failure, which is being treated with CVVH and electrolyte repletion.

Potential medical complications:

1. Worsening acidosis: The patient's acidosis may worsen if he continues to receive normal saline, which could increase his chloride levels and exacerbate the acidosis.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's hypotension and acidosis may lead to cardiac complications, such as cardiac failure or arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure may worsen if he is not adequately oxygenated, leading to respiratory failure or arrest.
4. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and potential sepsis may lead to infection, which could worsen his condition and increase his risk of mortality.
5. Renal complications: The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if he is not adequately treated, leading to further kidney damage or failure.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's seizure history and potential CNS infection may lead to neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's aspiration pneumonitis may lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or bowel obstruction."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.  On rounds, patient desatted to
   90s and appeared diaphoretic.
   - Send ET sputum for gram stain and culture to guide Abx as likely
   focal process developing
   - Continue sedation & intubation for now
   2) Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide
   attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal per home regimen while
   awake
   3) Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - CVVH as needed
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   4) Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   5) Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   6) Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   8) Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.  On rounds, patient desatted to
   90s and appeared diaphoretic.
   - Send ET sputum for gram stain and culture to guide Abx as likely
   focal process developing
   - Continue sedation & intubation for now
   2) Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide
   attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal per home regimen while
   awake
   3) Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - CVVH as needed
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   4) Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   5) Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   6) Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   8) Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 54-year-old man who was admitted to the ICU following an overdose of Metformin and a Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB) with a seizure. He remains intubated and is being managed for various medical complications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and being ventilated with a CPAP/PSV mode. He has a respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and his SpO2 is 93%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.38, PaO2 of 242, and PaCO2 of 49.
* Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is 120/56 mmHg, and his heart rate is 73 beats per minute. He has a sinus rhythm, and his cardiac output is normal.
* Neurological: The patient is sedated and able to open his eyes and follow commands.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, but his urine output is improving, and his creatinine levels are decreasing.
* Metabolic: The patient has a mild anemia, and his electrolyte levels are within normal range. He has a metabolic acidosis, which is currently resolved.
* Infection: The patient has a leukocytosis, which is likely secondary to the stress response and post-seizure. However, in the setting of lactic acidosis, infection needs to be ruled out. He has a pending cath tip and BCx culture.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Aspiration pneumonitis: The patient had witnessed aspiration following the administration of charcoal, which may have caused an aspiration pneumonitis.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has a significant hypoxia, which may be due to shunt physiology or another underlying condition.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient had a metabolic acidosis, which may recur if not managed properly.
5. Infection: The patient has a pending cath tip and BCx culture, which may indicate the presence of an infection.
6. Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts, and his thyroid function is not well-controlled.

The plan of care includes:

1. Continuing sedation and intubation for now.
2. Sending ET sputum for gram stain and culture to guide antibiotic therapy.
3. Restarting Risperidone, Wellbutrin, and Lamictal per home regimen while awake.
4. Following urine output and repleting electrolytes as needed.
5. Monitoring the patient's blood pressure and giving fluid boluses as needed.
6. Trending the patient's blood cultures and holding off on further antibiotics in the absence of evidence of infection.
7. Checking the patient's PM hct and ordering further laboratory tests to rule out anemia.
8. Holding levothyroxine given the recent ingestion.
9. Monitoring the patient's glycemic control and nutrition.
10. Continuously assessing the patient's condition and adjusting the plan of care as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 75-inch tall individual who is intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. They have been off pressors for 24 hours, with no CVVH indicated at this time. Sedation is required to keep them intubated. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 120/56 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 93%. They have a sinus rhythm and are receiving prophylactic heparin.

The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume of 650 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 14 cmH2O, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O. Their ABG results show a pH of 7.38, partial pressure of oxygen of 49 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 96 mmHg.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 15.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 197 K/uL. Their electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with the exception of a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L. Their blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction.

The patient's imaging studies show a more opaque CXR with decreased aeration, suggesting pneumonia or other respiratory disease. They have pending microbiology results from a catheter tip and blood culture.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is complex, and they may be at risk for respiratory failure if their ventilator settings are not adjusted properly.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and pending microbiology results suggest the possibility of sepsis.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels indicate kidney dysfunction, which may be a complication of their underlying disease or a result of inadequate fluid management.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's CXR suggests pneumonia or other respiratory disease, which may require additional antibiotic therapy and respiratory support.
5. Venous thromboembolism: The patient's prophylactic heparin therapy may not be adequate to prevent venous thromboembolism, which is a common complication in critically ill patients.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient's high dose of pantoprazole may not be adequate to prevent stress ulceration, which is a common complication in critically ill patients.
7. VAP: The patient's endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation may increase their risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1). Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.
   - Start Unasyn for aspiration pneumonia if evidence of infection
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Extubation trial today
   2). Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   3. Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   4 Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   5 Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - CVVH as needed
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   #. Psych:
   - On board, will follow when patient awake
   - Will attempt to get in touch with outpatient psychiatrist
   FEN: NPO for now, IVF as needed for BP

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1). Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.
   - Start Unasyn for aspiration pneumonia if evidence of infection
   - Follow sputum cultures
   - Extubation trial today
   2). Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   3. Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   4 Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   5 Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - CVVH as needed
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   #. Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   #. Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion

Summary:

The patient, a 54-year-old man with a history of depression, was admitted to the ICU following an overdose of Metformin and a Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB) with a seizure. He remains intubated but is clinically improving. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/56 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 93% on a FiO2 of 40%. He is receiving fluids and antibiotics, and his urine output is improving.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aspiration Pneumonitis: The patient has a history of aspiration following administration of charcoal, which may have led to an aspiration pneumonitis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of lung damage.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is decreasing during sleep and increasing with waking, which may be related to a vasopressor withdrawal. Further monitoring and fluid boluses as needed.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved, but close monitoring is necessary to prevent recurrence.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis is likely secondary to stress response or post-seizure, but it is essential to rule out infection, especially in the setting of lactic acidosis.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is improving, but close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte levels is necessary.
6. Anemia: The patient's mild anemia is unknown, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause and potential treatment.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient is being held on levothyroxine due to recent ingestion, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause and potential treatment.
8. Psychiatric Complications: The patient is being followed by a psychiatrist, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the extent of his psychiatric condition and potential treatment.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of his various medical complications to ensure his safe and effective treatment."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.  CXR this morning c/w diffused b/l
   infiltrates
   - Will hold on sputum specimens as it will likely not change management
   - Attempt a PS trial, give haldol 5 mg TID for sedation and try to wean
   off of fentanyl and midaz.  If needed will add propofol for sedation,
   but will try to extubate if suctioning becomes less frequent.
   # Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Will not Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal at this time
   - Given haldol will get daily EKGs
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Appreciate renal input
   # Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   # Elevated lipase:
   -Will hold TF
   -continue to monitor WBC, abdominal pain, fluid shifts
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved, and trending more
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   8) Hypothyroidism

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.  CXR this morning c/w diffused b/l
   infiltrates
   - Will hold on sputum specimens as it will likely not change management
   - Attempt a PS trial, give haldol 5 mg TID for sedation and try to wean
   off of fentanyl and midaz.  If needed will add propofol for sedation,
   but will try to extubate if suctioning becomes less frequent.
   # Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Will not Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal at this time
   - Given haldol will get daily EKGs
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Appreciate renal input
   # Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   # Elevated lipase:
   -Will hold TF
   -continue to monitor WBC, abdominal pain, fluid shifts
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved, and trending more
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   8) Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion

   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration

   - Will hold on sputum specimens as it will likely not change management
   - Attempt a PS trial, give haldol 5 mg TID for sedation and try to wean
   off of fentanyl and midaz.  If needed will add propofol for sedation,
   but will try to extubate if suctioning becomes less frequent.
   # Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Will not Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal at this time
   - Given haldol will get daily EKGs
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Appreciate renal input
   # Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   # Elevated lipase:
   -Will hold TF
   -continue to monitor WBC, abdominal pain, fluid shifts
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved, and trending more
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out

   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Unknown baseline, but has consistently trended down since
   admission from 39.3- ? related to renal failure vs. hemolyis
   - Follow HCT, MCV in 90s
   - B12, folate normal, TIBC, transferrin low, Ferritin normal
   -Send retic, hemolysis labs
   8) Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.  CXR this morning c/w diffused b/l
   infiltrates
   - Will hold on sputum specimens as it will likely not change management
   - Attempt a PS trial, give haldol 5 mg TID for sedation and try to wean
   off of fentanyl and midaz.  If needed will add propofol for sedation,
   but will try to extubate if suctioning becomes less frequent.
   # Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Will not Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal at this time
   - Given haldol will get daily EKGs
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Appreciate renal input
   # Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   # Elevated lipase:
   -Will hold TF
   -continue to monitor WBC, abdominal pain, fluid shifts
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved, and trending more
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Unknown baseline, but has consistently trended down since
   admission from 39.3- ? related to renal failure vs. hemolyis
   - Follow HCT, MCV in 90s
   - B12, folate normal, TIBC, transferrin low, Ferritin normal
   -Send retic, hemolysis labs
   8) Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion
   FEN: TF today, IVF as needed for BP
   Access: R HD line, will attempt further access today

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of depression who was admitted to the ICU after an overdose of Metformin and?CCB with seizure. He remains intubated but continues to improve clinically. The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, elevated lipase, metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, anemia, and hypothyroidism.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a high risk of respiratory failure due to his hypoxic respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonitis. He requires close monitoring of his oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed properly. He requires close monitoring of his urine output and electrolyte levels.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen if not managed properly, leading to shock. He requires close monitoring of his blood pressure and volume status.
4. Elevated Lipase: The patient's elevated lipase levels may indicate pancreatitis, which can lead to severe complications if not managed properly.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may indicate infection, which can worsen his condition if not managed properly.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not managed properly, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased immune function.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism may worsen if not managed properly, leading to decreased metabolism, fatigue, and decreased immune function.
8. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis may worsen if not managed properly, leading to respiratory and cardiac complications.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires close monitoring of his vital signs, oxygenation, and ventilation. He requires treatment for his respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, elevated lipase, leukocytosis, anemia, and hypothyroidism. He also requires close monitoring of his urine output and electrolyte levels. The patient's code status is full code, and he requires a 1:1 sitter when extubated."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities, including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypoglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 58 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/54 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's respiratory support is being managed with continuous mechanical ventilation, with a tidal volume of 650 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure of 31 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and creatinine levels, indicating inflammation and renal dysfunction. The patient's glucose levels are also elevated, suggesting potential hyperglycemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure can lead to further deterioration in lung function, increasing the risk of pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and respiratory failure.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can progress to chronic kidney disease, requiring long-term dialysis and increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia can lead to neurological complications, such as seizures, coma, and even death, if not promptly treated.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's metabolic acidosis can lead to further deterioration in respiratory and cardiac function, increasing the risk of multi-organ failure.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's hypotension and bradycardia can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.
6. Infection: The patient's respiratory failure and acute renal failure increase the risk of nosocomial infections, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and urinary tract infections.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's respiratory failure and acute renal failure can lead to gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, constipation, and diarrhea.

In summary, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and aggressive management to prevent potential complications and improve outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.  On rounds, patient desatted to
   90s and appeared diaphoretic.
   - Send ET sputum for gram stain and culture to guide Abx as likely
   focal process developing
   - Continue sedation & intubation for now
   2) Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide
   attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal per home regimen while
   awake
   3) Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - CVVH as needed
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   4) Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   5) Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   6) Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   1) Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  Patient had witnessed aspiration
   following administration of charcoal. Probably has an aspiration
   pneumonitis however does not explain significant hypoxia.  Unclear
   cause, however looks as though there is shunt physiology involved.  He
   remains afebrile and WBC decreasing.  On rounds, patient desatted to
   90s and appeared diaphoretic.
   - Send ET sputum for gram stain and culture to guide Abx as likely
   focal process developing
   - Continue sedation & intubation for now
   2) Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide
   attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal per home regimen while
   awake
   3) Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - CVVH as needed
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   4) Hypotension:  No longer requiring pressor support.  BP decreases
   during sleep and rises easily on waking.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   5) Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved.  Will repeat CVVH prn.
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   6) Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Mild anemia, unknown baseline
   - Check PM hct
   - retic, smear, iron panel, b12, folate
   8) Hypothyroidism
   - holding levothyroxine given recent ingestion

Summary:

The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of depression and suicide attempts, who presented with an overdose of Metformin and possibly a calcium channel blocker (CCB) with a seizure. He remains intubated and is improving clinically. The patient has several medical complications, including:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has witnessed aspiration following administration of charcoal, and his hypoxia is unclear, but it appears to be related to shunt physiology.
2. Psychiatric issues: The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts, and his psychiatric medications were restarted.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's baseline creatinine is uncertain, but his urine output is improving, and he will need to be monitored for electrolyte imbalances.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is decreasing during sleep and increasing on waking, and he may need fluid boluses.
5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's acidosis has resolved, and he will need to be monitored for any signs of recurrence.
6. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, and he will need to be monitored for signs of infection.
7. Anemia: The patient has mild anemia, and his hemoglobin level will need to be checked.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient is not currently taking levothyroxine due to recent ingestion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's hypoxia and aspiration pneumonitis make pneumonia a possible complication.
2. Sepsis: The patient's leukocytosis and potential infection make sepsis a possible complication.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure and hypoxia make respiratory failure a possible complication.
4. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of depression and medication overdose make cardiac arrhythmias a possible complication.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and potential electrolyte imbalances make renal failure a possible complication.
6. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and potential infection make infection a possible complication.
7. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's recent acidosis and potential electrolyte imbalances make metabolic acidosis a possible complication.
8. Hypothyroidism: The patient's hypothyroidism and potential medication interactions make hypothyroidism a possible complication.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation.
2. Monitor the patient's psychiatric status and provide support and treatment as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and provide fluid boluses as needed.
5. Monitor the patient's metabolic status and provide treatment for any signs of metabolic acidosis.
6. Monitor the patient's leukocytosis and provide treatment for any signs of infection.
7. Monitor the patient's anemia and provide treatment as needed.
8. Monitor the patient's hypothyroidism and provide treatment as needed."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  He remains afebrile but with increasing
   WBC.
   - Extubated, tolerating face mask now
   - Will hold on sputum specimens as it will likely not change management
   - LENI for questionable PE on CXR per radiology
   # Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Will not Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal at this time
   - Given haldol will get daily EKGs
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but rapidly improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Appreciate renal input
   #Ileus: Patient nauseated/vomiting today without bowel movement
   -          KUB to evaluate for bowel loops/free air
   -          Aggressive bowel regiment
   # Hypertension:  Paitent
s BP 150s
   -          Wean Nitrodrip
   -          Amlodipine 5mg when tolerating PO
   # Elevated lipase:
   -continue to monitor WBC, abdominal pain, fluid shifts
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved, and trending more
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Unknown baseline, but has consistently trended down since
   admission from 39.3- ? related to renal failure vs. hemolyis
   - Follow HCT, MCV in 90s
   - B12, folate normal, TIBC, transferrin low, Ferritin normal
   -Send retic, hemolysis labs
   8) Hypothyroidism
   - Restart Levothyroxine 50mcg IV now to 112mcg PO when tolerating PO

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, the following summary and potential medical complications can be determined:

**Summary:**

The patient, a 54-year-old man with a history of depression, was admitted to the ICU following an overdose of Metformin and a possible Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB). He remains intubated but is showing clinical improvement. The patient has been extubated and is tolerating a face mask. He has a history of depression and suicide attempts, and his mental health is being closely monitored.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:** The patient's respiratory status remains a concern, and he may require further respiratory support.
2. **Psychiatric Complications:** The patient's history of depression and suicide attempts increases the risk of psychiatric complications, such as agitation, aggression, or suicidal behavior.
3. **Acute Renal Failure:** The patient's baseline creatinine level is unknown, but his rapid improvement in renal function is encouraging. However, he may still require ongoing monitoring and treatment for acute renal failure.
4. **Ileus:** The patient's nausea, vomiting, and lack of bowel movement suggest the possibility of ileus, which may require further evaluation and treatment.
5. **Hypertension:** The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and he may require further management with medications such as amlodipine.
6. **Elevated Lipase:** The patient's elevated lipase levels may indicate pancreatitis, which requires ongoing monitoring and treatment.
7. **Metabolic Acidosis:** The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved, but he may still require ongoing monitoring and treatment.
8. **Leukocytosis:** The patient's leukocytosis may be secondary to stress response or post-seizure, but it also increases the risk of infection. Further evaluation and treatment may be necessary.
9. **Anemia:** The patient's anemia may be related to renal failure or hemolysis, and further evaluation and treatment may be necessary.
10. **Hypothyroidism:** The patient's hypothyroidism requires ongoing treatment with levothyroxine.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust respiratory support as necessary.
2. Maintain close monitoring of the patient's mental health and provide 1:1 sitter support as needed.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Evaluate the patient's ileus and consider further treatment options if necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's blood pressure and adjust treatment as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's lipase levels and consider further treatment options if necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's metabolic acidosis and adjust treatment as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's leukocytosis and consider further evaluation and treatment options if necessary.
9. Continue to monitor the patient's anemia and consider further evaluation and treatment options if necessary.
10. Continue to treat the patient's hypothyroidism with levothyroxine."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old male who was previously intubated and ventilated. He was extubated today, but remains hypertensive, with pressures still elevated. He is sedated with Haldol and propofol as needed, and is being weaned off fentanyl and midazolam. He is experiencing nausea and vomiting, and his vital signs are stable except for hypertension. He has decreased breath sounds and wheezes on the right side, and is experiencing abdominal tenderness. His laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and normal kidney and liver function. His imaging studies show a slightly larger right lower lobe infiltrate.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is a concern, as it can lead to cardiovascular complications such as heart failure, stroke, and kidney damage.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's wheezes and decreased breath sounds suggest respiratory failure, which can lead to respiratory arrest and death.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis, which can lead to organ failure and death.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's vomiting and nausea suggest the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to hypovolemic shock and death.
5. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypertension and decreased cardiac output suggest the possibility of cardiac complications such as heart failure, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias.
6. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and slow response to stimuli suggest the possibility of neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, and brain death.
7. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of infection, which can lead to organ failure and death.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's vital signs closely, particularly his blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate.
2. Continue to wean the patient off sedation and analgesia as tolerated.
3. Provide supportive care for the patient's respiratory failure, including oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation if necessary.
4. Consider antibiotic therapy for the patient's suspected sepsis.
5. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and provide supportive care as necessary.
6. Consider cardiology consultation for the patient's hypertension and cardiac complications.
7. Monitor the patient's neurological status and provide supportive care as necessary.
8. Consider infection control measures to prevent the spread of infection."

   Assessment and Plan
   This 54 year old man with history of depression presents following
   overdose of Metformin and ?CCB with seizure.  He remains intubated but
   continues to improve clinically.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:  He remains afebrile but with increasing
   WBC.
   - Extubated, tolerating face mask now
   - Will hold on sputum specimens as it will likely not change management
   # Psych:  The patient has a history of depression and suicide attempts.
   - Psych recs appreciated
   - 1:1 sitter when extubated
   - Will not Restart Risperidone, Wellbutrin, Lamictal at this time
   - Given haldol will get daily EKGs
   # Acute renal failure:  Baseline Cr uncertain but currently improving
   with good urine output.
   - follow urine output
   - renally dose meds
   - Replete electrolytes as needed
   - Appreciate renal input
   #Ileus:
   # Hypotension:  Resolved.
   - Give fluid bolus PRN
   # Elevated lipase:
   -Will hold TF
   -continue to monitor WBC, abdominal pain, fluid shifts
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Currently resolved, and trending more
   - Follow toxicology recommendations
   # Leukocytosis:  Most likely secondary to stress response / post
   seizure, but in setting of lactic acidosis also need to rule out
   infection.  Trending down.
   - Continue to trend
   - f/u blood, sputum and urine cultures
   - hold off on further antibiotics in evidence of fever/other evidence
   for infection
   7) Anemia:  Unknown baseline, but has consistently trended down since
   admission from 39.3- ? related to renal failure vs. hemolyis
   - Follow HCT, MCV in 90s
   - B12, folate normal, TIBC, transferrin low, Ferritin normal
   -Send retic, hemolysis labs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2176-1-27**] 05:15 PM
   -Sedated using Haldol 5 mg TID and propafol as needed, in attempt to
   wean fent/midaz-needs daily EKG, per psych decrease haldol to 2.5 TID
   with increased PRN.
   -Follow HCT-bump to 30.6
   -Extubated, remained hypertensive given haldol and ativan-pressures,
   still elevated, started on Nitro drip titrated to pressure <150
   -Per nurse: Desaturated with face shovel to low 90s, placed on face
   mask and did not increase so added nasal cannula.  Saturations improved
   while sleeping, and worsened while awake.

* Psychosis
* Acute renal failure
* Ileus
* Hypotension
* Elevated lipase
* Metabolic acidosis
* Leukocytosis
* Anemia
* Hypothyroidism

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Continued respiratory support with a face mask
* Psychiatric evaluation and management
* Renal dose adjustment of medications
* Repletion of electrolytes as needed
* Monitoring of urine output and abdominal pain
* Holding of TF and continued monitoring of WBC and fluid shifts
* Trending of lactic acid levels and follow-up of toxicology recommendations
* Continued monitoring of WBC, sputum, and urine cultures
* Holding off on further antibiotics in the absence of evidence of fever or infection

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation
* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections
* Sepsis or septic shock due to bacterial or fungal infections
* Renal failure or acute kidney injury due to inadequate perfusion or nephrotoxic medications
