   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetesI
   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, DKA and NSTEMI.
   1. Pneumonia:  Patient with a history of aspiration pneumonia has
   witnessed aspiration event at rehab facility now with worsening
   hypoxia, fever, elevated WBC, left sided infiltrate on imaging
   consistent with pneumonia.  Pt was treated for prior PNA with
   Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].  Sputum growing gram positive
   cocci.
   - NPO with NGT
   - abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover aspiration (pending speciation
   of sputum, blood cx)
   - f/u sputum culture speciation and sensitivity
   - consider long term feeding with g-tube, will discuss with family and
   address GOC
   - hold on steroids for now but will continue home dose of prednisone
   4mg PO qday
   - hold on PPI given current pneumonia
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema
   - Check vanco trough before next dose
   .
   2. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes still rising this AM
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - TTE
   - EKG this AM
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours
   - add on lipid panel from admission labs
   - change pravastatin to atorvastatin pending echo results
   - continue aspirin 325mg daily
   - echocardiogram
   .
   3.Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection, ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure of
   anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   4. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, now with acute renal
   failure with creatinine of 2.2.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal with
   dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.  Improved
   somewhat since admission following IVF.
   - renally dose medication
   - hold nephrotoxic medication (enalapril)
   - renal transplant recs
   - trend creatinine
   - continue IVF
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   5.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - 125cc free water hr/24hr for correction (started at 3AM)
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex as above
   .
   6. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   7. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro, last day to be [**5-20**]
   - broad spectrum abx as above
   - f/u urine cultures
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient, a 62-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration PNA, was admitted to the ICU after a witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, DKA, and NSTEMI. The patient has been receiving invasive ventilation, and his condition has been complicated by:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and has witnessed aspiration event, with worsening hypoxia, fever, and elevated WBC. Sputum culture growing gram-positive cocci.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has new T-wave inversions anteriorly and elevated cardiac biomarkers, indicating cardiac injury.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient has hyperglycemia, anion gap in the twenties, and ketones in the urine, likely precipitated by infection or ischemia.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has developed acute renal failure with creatinine of 2.2, likely due to pre-renal failure with dehydration.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely due to decreased access to free water, with a calculated free water deficit of 3L.
6. Immunosuppression: The patient is s/p cadaveric renal transplant and is receiving immunosuppressive therapy.
7. Recurrent UTI: The patient has a history of recurrent UTI and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's pneumonia and NSTEMI may lead to respiratory failure, requiring further ventilatory support.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's NSTEMI may lead to cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's DKA may lead to severe metabolic decompensation, requiring further insulin therapy and electrolyte management.
5. Infection: The patient's pneumonia and UTI may lead to sepsis, requiring further antibiotics and supportive care.
6. Immunosuppression: The patient's immunosuppressive therapy may increase the risk of infection, particularly opportunistic infections.

To manage these potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring, aggressive treatment of underlying conditions, and consideration of further interventions, such as cardiac catheterization, echocardiogram, and nutrition consultation."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 62-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia, presents to the ICU with pneumonia, DKA, and NSTEMI. He was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. Laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, and the patient has been started on heparin, aspirin, and statin. He has also been treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin, cefepime, and flagyl. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypoglycemia, and he has been started on insulin therapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has developed T-wave inversions on his EKG.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is likely to be a complication of his aspiration event, and it may be difficult to treat due to his underlying anoxic brain injury.
2. DKA: The patient's DKA is likely to be a complication of his type one diabetes, and it may be difficult to manage due to his underlying brain injury.
3. NSTEMI: The patient's NSTEMI is likely to be a complication of his underlying cardiovascular disease, and it may be difficult to manage due to his underlying brain injury.
4. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hypoglycemia is likely to be a complication of his insulin therapy, and it may be difficult to manage due to his underlying brain injury.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's VAP is likely to be a complication of his invasive ventilation, and it may be difficult to manage due to his underlying brain injury.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's DVT is likely to be a complication of his immobility, and it may be difficult to manage due to his underlying brain injury.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's stress ulcer is likely to be a complication of his underlying brain injury, and it may be difficult to manage due to his underlying brain injury.
8. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's cardiac arrhythmias are likely to be a complication of his underlying cardiovascular disease, and it may be difficult to manage due to his underlying brain injury.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and multifaceted, and it will require a comprehensive and individualized plan to manage. The patient's care should be coordinated by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including intensivists, pulmonologists, cardiologists, and neurologists. The patient's family should be involved in his care and should be educated on his condition and treatment options.

The patient's plan of care should include:

1. Invasive ventilation: The patient should continue to be ventilated to help him breathe and to prevent further respiratory complications.
2. Antibiotics: The patient should continue to receive antibiotics to treat his pneumonia and to prevent further infection.
3. Insulin therapy: The patient should continue to receive insulin therapy to manage his blood sugar levels and to prevent further complications.
4. Heparin therapy: The patient should continue to receive heparin therapy to prevent further thrombotic complications.
5. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient should continue to receive stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent further complications.
6. Cardiac monitoring: The patient should continue to be monitored for cardiac arrhythmias and other cardiac complications.
7. Neurological monitoring: The patient should continue to be monitored for neurological complications, including seizures and increased intracranial pressure.
8. Nutrition: The patient should receive nutrition support to help him recover from his underlying illness.

The patient's family should be educated on his condition and treatment options, and they should be involved in his care. The patient's care should be coordinated by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, and the patient's condition should be regularly monitored and reassessed to ensure that he is receiving the best possible care."

   .
   3.Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection, ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure of
   anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   4. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, now with acute renal
   failure with creatinine of 2.2.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal with
   dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.  Improved
   somewhat since admission following IVF.
   - renally dose medication
   - hold nephrotoxic medication (enalapril)
   - renal transplant recs
   - trend creatinine
   - continue IVF
   .
   5.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - 125cc free water hr/24hr for correction (started at 3AM)
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   .
   6. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   7. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro, last day to be [**5-20**]
   - broad spectrum abx as above
   - f/u urine cultures

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   witnessed aspiration event at rehab facility now with worsening
   hypoxia, fever, elevated WBC, left sided infiltrate on imaging
   consistent with pneumonia.  Pt was treated for prior PNA with
   Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].  Sputum growing gram positive
   cocci.
   - NPO with NGT
   - abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover aspiration
   - f/u sputum culture speciation and sensitivity
   - consider long term feeding with g-tube, will discuss with family and
   address GOC
   - hold on steroids for now but will continue home dose of prednisone
   4mg PO qday
   - hold on PPI given current pneumonia
   .
   2. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes still rising this AM
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - TTE
   - EKG this AM
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours
   - add on lipid panel from admission labs
   - change pravastatin to atorvastatin
   - continue aspirin 325mg daily
   .
   3.Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection, ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure of
   anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   4. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, now with acute renal
   failure with creatinine of 2.2.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal with
   dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.  Improved
   somewhat since admission following IVF.
   - renally dose medication
   - hold nephrotoxic medication (enalapril)
   - renal transplant recs
   - trend creatinine
   - continue IVF
   .
   5.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - 125cc free water hr/24hr for correction (started at 3AM)
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   .
   6. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone
   - f/u transplant recs

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old man with a complex medical history, including anoxic brain injury, type one diabetes, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, and a history of cadaveric renal transplant. He was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

The patient's condition has been unstable, with worsening hypoxia, fever, and elevated white blood cell count. He has also developed acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and immunosuppression. The patient's respiratory support has been adjusted, with invasive ventilation and tracheostomy tube placement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and there is a risk of further deterioration, which may lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiac biomarkers are elevated, and he has new T-wave inversions on EKG, which may indicate cardiac injury. There is a risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, and he has acute renal failure. There is a risk of further deterioration, which may lead to end-stage renal disease.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's anion gap is still elevated, and there is a risk of recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis if his glucose levels are not carefully controlled.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and may be at risk for further infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
6. Immunosuppression: The patient's immunosuppressive therapy may increase his risk of infection, and he may require closer monitoring for signs of infection.
7. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and he may require enteral nutrition to support his recovery.
8. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has hypernatremia, which may lead to complications such as seizures or cardiac arrhythmias if not corrected.

In summary, the patient's condition is complex and unstable, and there are several potential medical complications that can arise. Close monitoring and careful management are necessary to prevent these complications and ensure the patient's recovery."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia who presented after a witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was admitted to the ICU and has been treated with invasive ventilation, antibiotics, and insulin therapy. His condition has been complicated by several issues, including bacteremia, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and recurrent urinary tract infections.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is likely to worsen if not properly treated, and he may develop respiratory failure, sepsis, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.
2. NSTEMI: The patient's cardiac biomarkers are still rising, and he may develop cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock if not treated promptly.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's DKA may recur if not properly managed, and he may develop severe dehydration, acidosis, or even death.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not treated promptly, and he may develop electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or even require dialysis.
5. Bacteremia: The patient's bacteremia may lead to sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or organ failure if not properly treated.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to seizures, coma, or even death if not properly managed.
7. Recurrent UTI: The patient's recurrent UTI may lead to sepsis, kidney damage, or even death if not properly treated.
8. Immunosuppression: The patient's immunosuppression may increase his risk of infection, and he may develop opportunistic infections or sepsis if not properly managed.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to treat the patient's pneumonia with antibiotics and invasive ventilation.
2. Continue to manage the patient's NSTEMI with heparin therapy, aspirin, and statins.
3. Continue to manage the patient's DKA with insulin therapy and close monitoring of his blood sugar levels.
4. Continue to manage the patient's acute renal failure with IV fluids and close monitoring of his renal function.
5. Continue to treat the patient's bacteremia with antibiotics and monitor for signs of sepsis.
6. Continue to manage the patient's hypernatremia with IV fluids and close monitoring of his electrolyte levels.
7. Continue to manage the patient's recurrent UTI with antibiotics and monitor for signs of sepsis.
8. Continue to manage the patient's immunosuppression with close monitoring of his blood levels and administration of immunosuppressive therapy as needed.

ICU Care:

1. Nutrition: The patient should receive total parenteral nutrition (TPN) to support his nutritional needs.
2. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood sugar levels should be closely monitored and managed with insulin therapy as needed.
3. Lines: The patient's PICC line should be monitored for signs of infection or occlusion.
4. Prophylaxis: The patient should receive subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis.
5. Access: The patient's PICC line should be used for IV access.
6. Communication: The patient's wife and daughter should be kept informed of his condition and treatment plan.
7. Code status: The patient's code status should be maintained as full code.
8. Disposition: The patient should be transferred to a step-down unit or a medical ward once his condition stabilizes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Continue Vanco, cefepime until speciation.
   NSTEMI:  will check echo today.  Continue heparin, ASA for now.
   DKA.  gap closed. Continue insulin drip, as he needs free water.
   hypernatremia:  can also start free water per NGT.  Likely to worsen
   with diuresis
   start TFs.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old Russian-speaking individual who presents with respiratory failure, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and has undergone various interventions, including invasive ventilation, bronchoscopy, and placement of a percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line. The patient has also received multiple medications, including antibiotics, insulin, and heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely to worsen due to the presence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. The patient may require further diuresis with bumex given the lasix allergy.
2. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are high, and the insulin drip may need to be adjusted to maintain euglycemia.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are high, and the administration of free water may be necessary to correct this.
4. DKA: The patient's DKA is likely to worsen with diuresis, and close monitoring of blood glucose and electrolyte levels is necessary.
5. NSTEMI: The patient's NSTEMI requires close monitoring of cardiac enzymes and electrocardiogram (ECG) changes.
6. Sepsis: The patient's presence of GPCs in sputum and blood culture suggests the possibility of sepsis, which requires close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status.
7. VAP: The patient's presence of a tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
8. DVT: The patient's immobility and presence of a central catheter increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Recommendations:

1. Continue diuresis with bumex to manage pulmonary edema.
2. Monitor blood glucose and electrolyte levels closely and adjust insulin drip as necessary.
3. Administer free water to correct hypernatremia.
4. Continue heparin and ASA for NSTEMI.
5. Monitor for signs of sepsis and adjust antibiotics as necessary.
6. Implement VAP prevention measures, such as elevating the head of the bed and rotating the patient regularly.
7. Monitor for signs of DVT and consider prophylactic anticoagulation therapy.
8. Remove the PICC line as soon as possible to reduce the risk of complications."

   24 Hour Events:
   - Troponin peak at 1.79 in AM, then trending down. Plan to continue
   heparin gtt until [**2182-5-22**] AM then d/c.
   - TTE: new WMA compared to prior, inferolateral wall akinesis of
   unclear [**Last Name (LF) 12147**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] of 40%, mild MR. Consider cards consult.
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs: stop insulin gtt (stopped at 4PM), increase lantus from
   25 to 30 (kept at 25 given hx of AM hypoglycemia), nutrition consult,
   change FS to q6h
   - Started on tube feeds per nutrition recs but Novasource (renal 28gm
   Beneprotein @30ml/hr) not available overnight so started on Boost
   glucose control.
   - PICC line stayed in. Has GPC growing in 1 bottle, but wanted to keep
   on heparin gtt. Await speciation, then consider d/c.
   - D5W (free water) stopped after sodium dropped from 147 to 134
   although recheck was 143
   - Renal: continue with tacrolimus at current dose, given increased
   pravastatin dose monitor CK during next week (possible interaction with
   tacrolimus), continue IVF/volume resuscitation, continue D5W at 100
   cc/hr to correct 2.5L free water deficit, can transition to free water
   boluses as tolerated

   .
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - TTE with new abnormality but not consistent with changes on EKG
   - Call for formal cardiology consult
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours (to end this afternoon)
   - add on lipid panel from admission labs
   - change pravastatin to atorvastatin pending echo results
   - continue aspirin 325mg daily
   - echocardiogram
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles
   - follow up culture results
   - continue current broad antibiotics
   .
   #.Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection, ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure of
   anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, now with acute renal
   failure to Cr 2.2.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal with dehydration due to
   osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.  Improved since admission
   following IVF.
   - renally dose medication
   - hold nephrotoxic medication (enalapril)
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
   - trend creatinine
   - continue IVF
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   5.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - Renal recs: continue D5W at 100 cc/hr, transition to free water
   boluses by tube feed as tolerated
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex as above
   .
   6. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   7. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro, last day to be [**5-20**]
   - broad spectrum abx as above
   - f/u urine cultures

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Troponin peak at 1.79 in AM, then trending down. Plan to continue
   heparin gtt until [**2182-5-22**] AM then d/c.
   - TTE: new WMA compared to prior, inferolateral wall akinesis of
   unclear [**Last Name (LF) 12147**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] of 40%, mild MR. Consider cards consult.
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs: stop insulin gtt (stopped at 4PM), increase lantus from
   25 to 30 (kept at 25 given hx of AM hypoglycemia), nutrition consult,
   change FS to q6h
   - Started on tube feeds per nutrition recs but Novasource (renal 28gm
   Beneprotein @30ml/hr) not available overnight so started on Boost
   glucose control.
   - PICC line stayed in. Has GPC growing in 1 bottle, but wanted to keep
   on heparin gtt. Await speciation, then consider d/c.
   - D5W (free water) stopped after sodium dropped from 147 to 134
   although recheck was 143
   - Renal: continue with tacrolimus at current dose, given increased
   pravastatin dose monitor CK during next week (possible interaction with
   tacrolimus), continue IVF/volume resuscitation, continue D5W at 100
   cc/hr to correct 2.5L free water deficit, can transition to free water

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

**Summary:**

The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia who presented after a witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He was treated with antibiotics and insulin, and his cardiac biomarkers are trending down. He also has acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and is at risk for recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs).

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Cardiac Complications:** The patient's NSTEMI may progress to more severe cardiac complications, such as cardiogenic shock or heart failure, if not managed properly.
2. **Pulmonary Complications:** The patient's pneumonia may worsen, leading to respiratory failure, or may develop into a more severe infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. **Renal Complications:** The patient's acute renal failure may worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease, if not managed properly.
4. **Hyperglycemic Complications:** The patient's diabetic ketoacidosis may recur if his blood glucose levels are not properly managed.
5. **Infectious Complications:** The patient's UTI may recur or spread to other parts of his body, leading to sepsis or septic shock.
6. **Immune Complications:** The patient's immunosuppression due to his renal transplant may increase his risk of infections, such as pneumonia or UTIs.
7. **Gastrointestinal Complications:** The patient's aspiration pneumonia may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation if not managed properly.
8. **Neurological Complications:** The patient's anoxic brain injury may worsen, leading to neurological deficits or death, if not managed properly.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac biomarkers and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
2. Monitor the patient's pulmonary status closely and consider intubation if his oxygenation requirements increase.
3. Continue to manage the patient's renal failure with IVF and consider renal transplant recs.
4. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels closely and adjust his insulin regimen as needed.
5. Consider adding antibiotics to the patient's regimen to cover for potential infections.
6. Monitor the patient's immunosuppression closely and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.
7. Monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status closely and consider adding gastrointestinal prophylaxis if necessary.
8. Monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider consulting with a neurologist if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Consider adding a cardiology consult to the patient's treatment plan.
3. Consider adding a nephrology consult to the patient's treatment plan.
4. Consider adding a infectious disease consult to the patient's treatment plan.
5. Consider adding a gastrointestinal consult to the patient's treatment plan.
6. Continue to educate the patient's family on his condition and treatment plan."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia, who presents after a witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, DKA, and NSTEMI.

The patient's current condition is complicated by:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia and has witnessed an aspiration event, with worsening hypoxia, fever, and elevated WBC. Sputum culture is pending, and antibiotics have been started.
2. NSTEMI: The patient has new T-wave inversions on EKG and elevated cardiac biomarkers. Cardiac enzymes are trending down, and a formal cardiology consult is recommended.
3. GPC in bottles: The patient has GPC growing in one bottle, and antibiotics have been started pending speciation.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient has hyperglycemia, anion gap in the twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission. The precipitant is likely infection or ischemia.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.2. The likely cause is pre-renal with dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia likely due to decreased access to free water, with a calculated free water deficit of 3L.
7. Immunosuppression: The patient is an immunosuppressed renal transplant recipient, and tacrolimus levels should be checked.
8. Recurrent UTI: The patient has a history of recurrent UTI, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started pending urine culture results.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's pneumonia and UTI can lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's NSTEMI can lead to cardiac complications such as cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, or heart failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure can worsen, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's hypernatremia and dehydration can lead to electrolyte imbalances, which can be life-threatening.
5. Infection: The patient's immunosuppressed state can increase the risk of infection, which can be severe and life-threatening.

Given these conditions and potential complications, the patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU, with frequent assessments and adjustments to his treatment plan as needed."

   - Started on tube feeds per nutrition recs but Novasource (renal 28gm
   Beneprotein @30ml/hr) not available overnight so started on Boost
   glucose control.
   - PICC line stayed in. Has GPC growing in 1 bottle, but wanted to keep
   on heparin gtt. Await speciation, then consider d/c.
   - D5W (free water) stopped after sodium dropped from 147 to 134
   although recheck was 143
   - Renal: continue with tacrolimus at current dose, given increased
   pravastatin dose monitor CK during next week (possible interaction with
   tacrolimus), continue IVF/volume resuscitation, continue D5W at 100
   cc/hr to correct 2.5L free water deficit, can transition to free water
   boluses as tolerated

   [**2181-11-16**], left ventricular sysotlic function is now more significantly
   impaired. Focal apical septal hypokinesis was present previously.
   Inferolateral /inferior akinesis is new (there may have mild inferior
   hypokinesis previously).
   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetesI
   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, DKA and NSTEMI.
   #. Hypoxia:  Patient with a history of aspiration pneumonia has
   witnessed aspiration event at rehab facility now with worsening
   hypoxia, fever, elevated WBC, left sided infiltrate on imaging
   consistent with pneumonia vs atelectasis.  Pt was treated for prior PNA
   with Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].  Sputum growing gram
   positive cocci.
   - NPO with NGT
   -  initially treated with abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover
   aspiration pending speciation of sputum, blood cx; (day 1 = [**5-20**])
   - f/u sputum culture speciation and sensitivity
   - consider long term feeding with g-tube, will discuss with family and
   address GOC
   - hold on steroids for now but will continue home dose of prednisone
   4mg PO qday
   - hold on PPI given current pneumonia
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema
   - hold antibiotics for now as this likely did not represent a true
   pneumonia
   .
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - TTE with new abnormality but not consistent with changes on EKG
   - Call for formal cardiology consult
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours (to end this afternoon)
   - add on lipid panel from admission labs
   - change pravastatin to atorvastatin pending echo results
   - continue aspirin 325mg daily
   - change lopressor to 12.5mg PO BID
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles
   - follow up culture results; ensure recent blood cultures (peripherals)
   - continue current broad antibiotics
   - remove PICC line, sent tip for culture.  Request new PICC placement
   for tomorrow.
   .
   #.Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection, ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure of
   anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, now with acute renal
   failure to Cr 2.2.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal with dehydration due to
   osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.  Improved since admission
   following IVF.
   - renally dose medication
   - touch base with renal regarding nephrotoxic medication (enalapril)
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
   - trend creatinine
   - continue IVF
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   5.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - Renal recs: transition to free water boluses by tube feed as
   tolerated
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex as above
   .
   6. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   7. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro, last day to be [**5-20**]
   - broad spectrum abx as above; will add ceftriaxone 1gm IV q 24 hours
   - f/u urine cultures
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

TITLE:
   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Troponin peak at 1.79 in AM, then trending down. Plan to continue
   heparin gtt until [**2182-5-22**] AM then d/c.
   - TTE: new WMA compared to prior, inferolateral wall akinesis of
   unclear [**Last Name (LF) 12147**], [**First Name3 (LF) 300**] of 40%, mild MR. Consider cards consult.
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs: stop insulin gtt (stopped at 4PM), increase lantus from
   25 to 30 (kept at 25 given hx of AM hypoglycemia), nutrition consult,
   change FS to q6h
   - Started on tube feeds per nutrition recs but Novasource (renal 28gm
   Beneprotein @30ml/hr) not available overnight so started on Boost
   glucose control.
   - PICC line stayed in. Has GPC growing in 1 bottle, but wanted to keep
   on heparin gtt. Await speciation, then consider d/c.
   - D5W (free water) stopped after sodium dropped from 147 to 134
   although recheck was 143
   - Renal: continue with tacrolimus at current dose, given increased
   pravastatin dose monitor CK during next week (possible interaction with
   tacrolimus), continue IVF/volume resuscitation, continue D5W at 100
   cc/hr to correct 2.5L free water deficit, can transition to free water
   boluses as tolerated

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetesI
   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, DKA and NSTEMI.
   #. Hypoxia:  Patient with a history of aspiration pneumonia has
   witnessed aspiration event at rehab facility now with worsening
   hypoxia, fever, elevated WBC, left sided infiltrate on imaging
   consistent with pneumonia vs atelectasis.  Pt was treated for prior PNA
   with Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].  Sputum growing gram
   positive cocci.
   - NPO with NGT
   -  initially treated with abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover
   aspiration pending speciation of sputum, blood cx; (day 1 = [**5-20**])
   - f/u sputum culture speciation and sensitivity
   - consider long term feeding with g-tube, will discuss with family and
   address GOC
   - hold on steroids for now but will continue home dose of prednisone
   4mg PO qday
   - hold on PPI given current pneumonia
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema
   - hold antibiotics for now as this likely did not represent a true
   pneumonia
   .
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - TTE with new abnormality but not consistent with changes on EKG
   - Call for formal cardiology consult
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours (to end this afternoon)
   - add on lipid panel from admission labs
   - change pravastatin to atorvastatin pending echo results
   - continue aspirin 325mg daily
   - change lopressor to 12.5mg PO BID
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles
   - follow up culture results; ensure recent blood cultures (peripherals)
   - continue current broad antibiotics
   - remove PICC line, sent tip for culture.  Request new PICC placement
   for tomorrow.
   .
   #.Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection, ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure of
   anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, now with acute renal
   failure to Cr 2.2.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal with dehydration due to
   osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.  Improved since admission
   following IVF.
   - renally dose medication
   - touch base with renal regarding nephrotoxic medication (enalapril)
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
   - trend creatinine
   - continue IVF
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   5.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - Renal recs: transition to free water boluses by tube feed as
   tolerated
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex as above
   .
   6. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia who presents with worsening hypoxia, fever, elevated WBC, and left-sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with pneumonia or atelectasis. He has a history of NSTEMI and is currently receiving heparin gtt. He has also been diagnosed with acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and hyperglycemia. He is currently receiving treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis and is being monitored for cardiac enzymes and troponin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and imaging studies suggest the possibility of pneumonia, which could worsen his condition and lead to respiratory failure.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin levels are elevated, suggesting possible cardiac injury. This could lead to cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating acute renal failure. This could lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which could lead to dehydration, seizures, and other complications.
5. Diabetic Ketoacidosis: The patient's hyperglycemia and ketones in the urine suggest diabetic ketoacidosis, which could lead to severe complications if not properly managed.
6. Immunosuppression: The patient's history of cadaveric renal transplant and current immunosuppressive therapy make him vulnerable to infections.
7. Recurrent UTI: The patient's history of recurrent UTIs suggests a possible underlying urinary tract abnormality that may require further evaluation and treatment.
8. GPC Infection: The patient's sputum culture is growing GPC, which could lead to a serious infection if not properly treated.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac enzymes and troponin levels to assess for cardiac complications.
2. Manage the patient's hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis with insulin and close monitoring of blood glucose levels.
3. Continue to treat the patient's pneumonia with antibiotics and consider further imaging studies to determine the extent of the infection.
4. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medication dosages as needed to prevent further renal damage.
5. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's recurrent UTIs.
6. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust treatment as needed to prevent complications such as hypernatremia.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's immunosuppressive therapy and adjust as needed to prevent infections.
8. Consider further evaluation and treatment for the patient's GPC infection."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia who presents with pneumonia, DKA, and NSTEMI after a witnessed aspiration event. He is currently in the ICU and is being treated for pneumonia with antibiotics, DKA with insulin, and NSTEMI with heparin and aspirin. He also has acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and immunosuppression due to a previous cadaveric renal transplant.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is worsening, and he is at risk for respiratory failure and sepsis.
2. NSTEMI: The patient's cardiac enzymes are still rising, and he is at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias and heart failure.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, and he is at risk for further kidney damage and need for dialysis.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated, and he is at risk for dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Immunosuppression: The patient is immunosuppressed due to his renal transplant, and he is at risk for infections and rejection of the transplant.
6. Recurrent UTI: The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs, and he is at risk for further infections.
7. DKA: The patient's DKA is improving, but he is at risk for further episodes of DKA if his insulin therapy is not optimized.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management. He needs to be treated for his pneumonia, DKA, and NSTEMI, and his acute renal failure and hypernatremia need to be managed. He also needs to be monitored for signs of cardiac complications and immunosuppression. The patient's family should be educated on his condition and treatment plan, and they should be involved in his care."

   PNA:  Sputum cx. with no significant growth.  Unclear if he had a PNA.
   Respiratory failure:  More likely to be due to pulmonary edema in
   setting of acute cardiac event.  Try SBT and TC.
   NSTEMI:  EF is down with new WMA.  might benefit from ACE, but will
   touch base with renal. Start lopressor 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
   Will have cardiology see, to assess whether he should have cath.
   GPCs:  coag negative in PIC line.  Will remove PIC line once heparin
   infusion is completed.  However doubt that this is a line infection.
   DKA:  AG closed.  Continue home regimen and TFs.
   hypernatremia: continue free water bolus.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 [**Last Name 121**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
   PNA:  Sputum cx. with no significant growth.  Unclear if he had a PNA.
   Respiratory failure:  More likely to be due to pulmonary edema in
   setting of acute cardiac event.  Try SBT and TC.
   NSTEMI:  EF is down with new WMA.  might benefit from ACE, but will
   touch base with renal. Start lopressor 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **].
   Will have cardiology see, to assess whether he should have cath.
   GPCs:  coag negative in PIC line.  Will remove PIC line once heparin
   infusion is completed.  However doubt that this is a line infection.
   DKA:  AG closed.  Continue home regimen and TFs.
   hypernatremia: continue free water bolus.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old Russian-speaking man who was admitted with respiratory failure, NSTEMI, and aspiration pneumonia. He is currently in the ICU, receiving mechanical ventilation and other supportive care.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 62 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 121/55 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 100% on a FiO2 of 50%. His respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube, CPAP/PSV ventilator mode, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.3, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 318. His creatinine is 2.7 mg/dL, and his troponin-T is 1.47 ng/mL. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated glucose level of 84 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history is significant for NSTEMI, and his current diagnosis includes acute myocardial infarction, aspiration pneumonia, hyperglycemia, and possible pulmonary edema.

Potential medical complications that may arise in this patient include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's NSTEMI and decreased ejection fraction may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiogenic shock.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient's pulmonary edema may worsen, leading to respiratory failure or cardiac complications.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose level is elevated, which may increase the risk of complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic coma.
5. Infection: The patient's PIC line is colonized with coag-negative staph, which may lead to line infection or bacteremia.
6. DVT: The patient's immobility and respiratory failure may increase the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis.
7. Stress ulcer: The patient's critical illness may increase the risk of developing stress ulcer, which may lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.

Based on this information, the patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent these potential complications."

   - hold on steroids for now but will continue home dose of prednisone
   4mg PO qday
   - hold on PPI given current pneumonia
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema
   - hold antibiotics for now as this likely did not represent a true
   pneumonia
   .
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - TTE with new abnormality but not consistent with changes on EKG
   - Call for formal cardiology consult
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours (to end this afternoon)
   - add on lipid panel from admission labs
   - change pravastatin to atorvastatin pending echo results
   - continue aspirin 325mg daily
   - change lopressor to 12.5mg PO BID
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles
   - follow up culture results; ensure recent blood cultures (peripherals)
   - continue current broad antibiotics
   - remove PICC line, sent tip for culture.  Request new PICC placement
   for tomorrow.
   .
   #.Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection, ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure of
   anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, now with acute renal
   failure to Cr 2.2.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal with dehydration due to
   osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.  Improved since admission
   following IVF.
   - renally dose medication
   - touch base with renal regarding nephrotoxic medication (enalapril)
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
   - trend creatinine
   - continue IVF
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - Renal recs: transition to free water boluses by tube feed as
   tolerated
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex as above
   .
   #. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   #. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro, last day to be [**5-20**]
   - broad spectrum abx as above; will add ceftriaxone 1gm IV q 24 hours
   - f/u urine cultures
   .

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   pneumonia
   .
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - TTE with new abnormality but not consistent with changes on EKG

   - add on lipid panel from admission labs
   - change pravastatin to atorvastatin pending echo results
   - continue aspirin 325mg daily
   - change lopressor to 12.5mg PO BID
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles
   - follow up culture results; ensure recent blood cultures (peripherals)
   - continue current broad antibiotics
   - remove PICC line, sent tip for culture.  Request new PICC placement
   for tomorrow.
   .
   #.Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection, ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure of
   anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, now with acute renal
   failure to Cr 2.2.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal with dehydration due to
   osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.  Improved since admission
   following IVF.
   - renally dose medication
   - touch base with renal regarding nephrotoxic medication (enalapril)
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
   - trend creatinine
   - continue IVF
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - Renal recs: transition to free water boluses by tube feed as
   tolerated
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex as above
   .
   #. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   #. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro, last day to be [**5-20**]
   - broad spectrum abx as above; will add ceftriaxone 1gm IV q 24 hours
   - f/u urine cultures
   .
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, TFs (novasource)
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; starting PPI
   # Access: PICC line, PIV

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia, who presented with a witnessed aspiration event, pneumonia, DKA, and NSTEMI. He has been treated for pneumonia with antibiotics, and his cardiac enzymes are trending down. He has also been diagnosed with acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and recurrent UTI. He is currently on invasive ventilation, and his vital signs are stable. He has a PICC line in place, which was pulled due to GPCs, and will be replaced tomorrow. He is also receiving bumex for pulmonary edema and heparin for DVT prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is at risk for respiratory failure due to his underlying lung disease and pneumonia.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of NSTEMI, and his cardiac enzymes are trending down, but he may still be at risk for cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and his creatinine level is 2.2. He may require further treatment and monitoring to prevent further kidney damage.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent UTI, and his white blood cell count is elevated. He may be at risk for further infections, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections.
5. Fluid overload: The patient has a history of fluid overload, and his electrolyte levels are abnormal. He may require further treatment and monitoring to prevent further fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia, and he may be at risk for further gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or bleeding.
7. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of anoxic brain injury, and he may be at risk for further neurological complications such as seizures, stroke, or brain edema.
8. Immunosuppression: The patient has a history of cadaveric renal transplant, and he is at risk for immunosuppression-related complications such as infection or rejection.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his oxygen therapy and ventilation settings as necessary.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status and adjust his medication and treatment plan as necessary.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his medication and treatment plan as necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's infection risk and adjust his antibiotic therapy and treatment plan as necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's fluid status and adjust his fluid management plan as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's gastrointestinal status and adjust his medication and treatment plan as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his medication and treatment plan as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's immunosuppression status and adjust his medication and treatment plan as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with history of multiple strokes, type one diabetesI
   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   witnessed aspiration event with DKA and NSTEMI.
   #. Hypoxia: Hypoxia felt most likely due to acute aspiration event (but
   without development of aspiration pneumonia) and/or from volume
   overload in setting of CHF flare (c/w CXR findings) in setting of
   NSTEMI (though pt not volume overloaded on exam).
   Patient does have a history of aspiration pneumonia with possible
   aspiration event at rehab facility and mild fever and elevated WBC on
   presentation (both resolved now and may be explained by UTI), left
   sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with atelectasis.  Pt was
   treated for prior PNA with Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].
   Sputum growing gram positive cocci but culture with sparse commensals
   only.
   -  Initially treated with abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover
   aspiration pending speciation of sputum ([**Date range (1) 12158**]); discontinued as
   felt presentation more c/w fluid overload vs pneumonia
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema for goal even I/Os today (dose PRN)
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down but troponin
   slightly up today [**5-23**]
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - Daily EKG
   - TTE with new abnormality in inferolateral wall
   - Appreciate cardiology recs: will accept pt for cath on Monday and
   transfer of pt to service; team requests description of pt
s anatomy
   s/p CABG
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours (ended [**5-22**])
   - Follow-up lipid panel from admission labs
   - Continue lopressor, ASA, enalapril, statin
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles: coag-negative staph; most likely contaminant vs
   PICC colonization. PICC pulled [**5-22**].
   - follow up culture results (repeat blood cultures from [**5-22**] and PICC
   tip culture)
   - Request new PICC placement today?
   .
   # Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection vs ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure
   of anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs but

   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, presented with acute
   renal failure to Cr 2.2, now resolving.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal
   with dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.
   - renally dose medication
   - Enalapril restarted [**5-22**] (discussed with renal); will hold today in
   order to allow for BB (pressures drop to 80s with both meds)
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
   - trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes

   #.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - Renal recs: transition to free water boluses by tube feed as
   tolerated: pt receiving 250 cc q6h, but remains hypernatremic. Plan to
   increase to 250 cc q4h.
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex as above
   .
   #. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of multiple strokes, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia who presented with a witnessed aspiration event, DKA, and NSTEMI. He has been treated for pneumonia with cefepime and azithromycin, but the sputum culture grew gram-positive cocci with sparse commensals only. He has also been treated for a UTI with ceftriaxone, but developed a rash and was switched to cefepime. He has been experiencing hypoxia, likely due to acute aspiration or fluid overload, and has been treated with bumex for pulmonary edema. He has also been experiencing NSTEMI, with new T wave inversions and elevated cardiac biomarkers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and aspiration event put him at risk for respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by his underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
2. Pneumonia: The patient's history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and recent UTI increase his risk of developing pneumonia, which could be complicated by his underlying medical conditions.
3. Sepsis: The patient's UTI and pneumonia put him at risk for sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
4. Cardiac complications: The patient's NSTEMI and cardiac biomarkers suggest that he may be at risk for cardiac complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest.
5. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and hypernatremia put him at risk for further renal damage or failure, which could be complicated by his underlying medical conditions.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and recent UTI increase his risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction.
7. Infections: The patient's history of recurrent UTI and pneumonia increase his risk of developing other infections, such as skin infections or bloodstream infections.
8. Metabolic complications: The patient's DKA and hyperglycemia put him at risk for metabolic complications, such as acidosis or electrolyte imbalances.

Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, it is essential to closely monitor his respiratory, cardiac, renal, and gastrointestinal function, as well as his metabolic and electrolyte status. He should also receive antibiotic treatment for his UTI and pneumonia, and his cardiac biomarkers should be closely monitored for any signs of cardiac complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetesI
   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, DKA and NSTEMI.
   #. Hypoxia:  Patient with a history of aspiration pneumonia had
   possible aspiration event at rehab facility now with worsening hypoxia,
   mild fever, elevated WBC, left sided infiltrate on imaging consistent
   with pneumonia vs atelectasis.  Pt was treated for prior PNA with
   Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].  Sputum growing gram positive
   cocci but culture with sparse commensals only.  Hypoxia felt most
   likely due to acute aspiration event without pneumonia or volume
   overload in setting of CHF flare due to CXR findings, though pt not
   volume overloaded on exam.
   - NPO with NGT
   -  Initially treated with abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover
   aspiration pending speciation of sputum ([**Date range (1) 12158**]); discontinued as
   felt presentation more c/w fluid overload vs pneumonia
   - f/u sputum fungal culture
   - consider long term feeding with g-tube, will discuss with family and
   address GOC
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema for goal even I/Os today
   .
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - TTE with new abnormality in inferolateral wall
   - Appreciate cardiology recs: will accept pt for cath on Monday and
   transfer of pt to service
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours (ended [**5-22**])
   - Follow-up lipid panel from admission labs
   - Continue lopressor, ASA, enalapril, statin
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles: coag-negative staph; most likely contaminant vs
   PICC colonization. PICC pulled [**5-22**].
   - follow up culture results (including repeat blood cultures from [**5-22**]
   and PICC tip culture)
   - Request new PICC placement today?
   .
   # Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection vs ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure
   of anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs but
   episode of hypoglycemia in AM [**5-23**]: will decrease back to 25 tonight
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, presented with acute
   renal failure to Cr 2.2, now resolving.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal
   with dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.
   - renally dose medication
   - Enalapril restarted [**5-22**] (discussed with renal)
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
   - trend creatinine
   - continue IVF
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - Renal recs: transition to free water boluses by tube feed as
   tolerated: pt receiving 250 cc q4h, but remains hypernatremic. Plan to
   increase to 250 cc q3h.
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex as above
   .
   #. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone, cellcept
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   #. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro, last day to be [**5-20**]. Now with E.
   Coli UTI.
   - Cefepime 1gm IV q 24 hours day 1 = [**5-20**], 7 day course to end [**5-27**]
   - Replace Foley
   .
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, TFs (novasource with free water flushes)
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; PPI; pneumoboots
   # Access: PIV
   # Communication: Wife and daughter

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   daughter who believes patient would want to undergo this procedure. Can
   transfer to [**Hospital1 2259**] when stable for floor.
   - Nutrition: switched to Novasource/beneprotein TF with 250 cc water
   q4h for hypernatremia (equivalent to 60 cc/hr, per renal recs)
   - Renal recs: need 60 ml/hr free h20 for 1.8L deficit; also may
   consider stopping cellcept and continuing on 2 dose immunosuppresive
   regimen (prednisone/tacrolimus) once Cr is stable (so that can monitor
   for rejection by Cr level), given high risk for infections
   - Stopped vanc/cefepime/flagyl given hypoxia likely due to fluid
   overload, not PNA
   - Started ceftriaxone [**5-22**] for UTI with GNRs (7 day course); cx
   returned susceptible to ceftriaxone/cefepime.  Patient with likely drug
   rash to ceftriaxone with erythematous, blanching rash on bilateral
   upper extremities and trunk. Received fexofenadine and discontinued
   ceftriaxone and restarted cefepime.
   - On bumex for goal 1-2 L neg fluid balance today
   - PICC pulled today given [**2-11**] GPCs, will culture tip and repeat
   peripheral blood cx
   - heparin gtt discontinued (received 48 hrs)
   - Interpreter visited; [**Name8 (MD) **] RN pt was fully alert, oriented, following

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU after a witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, DKA, and NSTEMI. The patient's current condition is characterized by worsening hypoxia, mild fever, elevated WBC, and a left-sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with pneumonia or atelectasis. He has a history of aspiration pneumonia and was treated with Cefepime/Azithromycin, which was discontinued due to concerns of fluid overload. The patient's labs show elevated cardiac biomarkers, and he has been treated with heparin for 48 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening hypoxia and mild fever suggest a high risk of respiratory failure, which could lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or even death.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC and left-sided infiltrate on imaging suggest a high risk of sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and death.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's NSTEMI and elevated cardiac biomarkers suggest a high risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, or even cardiac arrest.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and hypernatremia suggest a high risk of further renal deterioration, which could lead to chronic kidney disease or even end-stage renal disease.
5. Infection: The patient's UTI and history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia suggest a high risk of further infections, which could lead to sepsis, organ failure, or even death.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia and DKA suggest a high risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration, nausea, and vomiting.
7. Neurological complications: The patient's history of anoxic brain injury and aspiration pneumonia suggest a high risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or even brain death.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and consider intubation if necessary.
2. Administer antibiotics and antifungals as prescribed to treat the patient's UTI and pneumonia.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac status closely and consider cardiac catheterization if necessary.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's renal function closely and consider dialysis if necessary.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels closely and consider IV fluids if necessary.
6. Consider prophylactic antibiotics to prevent further infections.
7. Consider gastrointestinal prophylaxis to prevent aspiration and nausea.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's neurological status closely and consider neurological consultations if necessary.

By closely monitoring the patient's condition and addressing potential complications promptly, we can help to improve his outcome and reduce the risk of further complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetesI
   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, DKA and NSTEMI.
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down but troponin
   slightly up today [**5-23**]
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - Daily EKG
   - TTE with new abnormality in inferolateral wall
   - Appreciate cardiology recs: will accept pt for cath on Monday and
   transfer of pt to service; team requests description of pt
s anatomy
   s/p CABG
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours (ended [**5-22**])
   - Follow-up lipid panel from admission labs
   - Continue lopressor, ASA, enalapril, statin
   .
   #. Hypoxia: Hypoxia felt most likely due to acute aspiration event (but
   without development of aspiration pneumonia) and/or from volume
   overload in setting of CHF flare (c/w CXR findings) in setting of
   NSTEMI (though pt not volume overloaded on exam).
   Patient does have a history of aspiration pneumonia with possible
   aspiration event at rehab facility and mild fever and elevated WBC on
   presentation (both resolved now and may be explained by UTI), left
   sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with atelectasis.  Pt was
   treated for prior PNA with Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].
   Sputum growing gram positive cocci but culture with sparse commensals
   only.
   -  Initially treated with abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover
   aspiration pending speciation of sputum ([**Date range (1) 12158**]); discontinued as
   felt presentation more c/w fluid overload vs pneumonia
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema for goal even I/Os today
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles: coag-negative staph; most likely contaminant vs
   PICC colonization. PICC pulled [**5-22**].
   - follow up culture results (repeat blood cultures from [**5-22**] and PICC
   tip culture)
   - Request new PICC placement today?
   .
   # Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection vs ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure
   of anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs but
   episode of hypoglycemia in AM [**5-23**]: will decrease back to 25 tonight
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, presented with acute
   renal failure to Cr 2.2, now resolving.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal
   with dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.
   - renally dose medication
   - Enalapril restarted [**5-22**] (discussed with renal)
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
   - trend creatinine
   - continue IVF
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - Renal recs: transition to free water boluses by tube feed as
   tolerated: pt receiving 250 cc q4h, but remains hypernatremic. Plan to
   increase to 250 cc q3h.
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex as above
   .
   #. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone, cellcept
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   #. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro, last day to be [**5-20**]. Now with E.
   Coli UTI.
   - Cefepime 1gm IV q 24 hours day 1 = [**5-20**], 7 day course to end [**5-27**]
   - Replace Foley
   .
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, TFs (novasource with free water flushes)
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; PPI; pneumoboots
   # Access: PIV
   # Communication: Wife and daughter
   # Code:  Full per prior admission, not yet discussed again with family
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement

Based on the provided physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He presents with pneumonia, DKA, and NSTEMI after a witnessed aspiration event.

The patient's current status is as follows:

* Respiratory support: Invasive ventilation has been stopped, and he is receiving oxygen through a tracheostomy tube.
* Cardiovascular: He has new T-wave inversions anteriorly and elevated cardiac biomarkers, indicating NSTEMI.
* Renal: He has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.2, which is resolving.
* Electrolytes: He has hypernatremia, which is likely due to decreased access to free water.
* Infectious disease: He has a UTI caused by E. Coli, which is being treated with cefepime.
* Immunosuppression: He is receiving immunosuppressive therapy for his cadaveric renal transplant.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current status include:

* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he may require reintubation.
* Cardiac complications: The patient's NSTEMI may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac arrest.
* Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.
* Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's hypernatremia may lead to seizures, coma, or death if not corrected.
* Infection: The patient's UTI may spread to other parts of his body, such as his bloodstream or lungs.
* Immunosuppression: The patient's immunosuppressive therapy may increase his risk of infection or rejection of his renal transplant.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Monitoring his respiratory status and cardiac biomarkers.
* Managing his hypernatremia with free water boluses.
* Treating his UTI with cefepime.
* Continuing his immunosuppressive therapy.
* Monitoring his electrolyte levels and adjusting his therapy as needed.
* Planning for discharge to a rehabilitation facility once his clinical status improves."

   62 year old man with history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetesI
   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   witnessed aspiration event with pneumonia, DKA and NSTEMI.
   #. Hypoxia:  Patient with a history of aspiration pneumonia had
   possible aspiration event at rehab facility now with worsening hypoxia,
   mild fever, elevated WBC, left sided infiltrate on imaging consistent
   with pneumonia vs atelectasis.  Pt was treated for prior PNA with
   Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].  Sputum growing gram positive
   cocci but culture with sparse commensals only.  Hypoxia felt most
   likely due to acute aspiration event without pneumonia or volume
   overload in setting of CHF flare due to CXR findings, though pt not
   volume overloaded on exam.
   - NPO with NGT
   -  Initially treated with abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover
   aspiration pending speciation of sputum ([**Date range (1) 12158**]); discontinued as
   felt presentation more c/w fluid overload vs pneumonia
   - f/u sputum fungal culture
   - consider long term feeding with g-tube, will discuss with family and
   address GOC
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema for goal even I/Os today
   .
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - TTE with new abnormality in inferolateral wall
   - Appreciate cardiology recs: will accept pt for cath on Monday and
   transfer of pt to service
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours (ended [**5-22**])
   - Follow-up lipid panel from admission labs
   - Continue lopressor, ASA, enalapril, statin
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles: coag-negative staph; most likely contaminant vs
   PICC colonization. PICC pulled [**5-22**].
   - follow up culture results (including repeat blood cultures from [**5-22**]
   and PICC tip culture)
   - Request new PICC placement today?
   .
   # Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection vs ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure
   of anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs but
   episode of hypoglycemia in AM [**5-23**]: will decrease back to 25 tonight

   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, presented with acute
   renal failure to Cr 2.2, now resolving.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal
   with dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.
   - renally dose medication
   - Enalapril restarted [**5-22**] (discussed with renal)
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
   - trend creatinine
   - continue IVF
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - Renal recs: transition to free water boluses by tube feed as
   tolerated: pt receiving 250 cc q4h, but remains hypernatremic. Plan to
   increase to 250 cc q3h.
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex as above
   .
   #. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone, cellcept
   - f/u transplant recs

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of anoxic brain injury, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia, who presented to the ICU with pneumonia, DKA, and NSTEMI. He was treated with antibiotics, insulin, and heparin, and is currently on ventilator support. His condition has been complicated by hypoxia, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, and recurrent UTI.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia has been treated with antibiotics, but the infection may not be fully cleared, and the patient may be at risk for further complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, or death.
2. DKA: The patient's DKA has been treated with insulin, but the patient may be at risk for further complications such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or ketoacidosis.
3. NSTEMI: The patient's NSTEMI has been treated with heparin and aspirin, but the patient may be at risk for further complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or death.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure has been treated with IV fluids and diuretics, but the patient may be at risk for further complications such as electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, or death.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia has been treated with IV fluids and diuretics, but the patient may be at risk for further complications such as seizures, coma, or death.
6. Recurrent UTI: The patient's recurrent UTI has been treated with antibiotics, but the patient may be at risk for further complications such as sepsis, kidney damage, or death.
7. Immunosuppression: The patient's immunosuppressive therapy may increase the risk of infection, and the patient may be at risk for further complications such as sepsis, pneumonia, or death.
8. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, may be related to his pneumonia, DKA, or other underlying conditions, and may increase the risk of further complications such as aspiration, sepsis, or death.
9. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory symptoms, such as hypoxia and hypercapnia, may be related to his pneumonia, DKA, or other underlying conditions, and may increase the risk of further complications such as respiratory failure, sepsis, or death.

These potential medical complications highlight the need for close monitoring and aggressive management of the patient's condition to prevent further complications and improve his outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with history of multiple strokes, type one diabetesI
   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   possible  aspiration event with hypoxia, DKA and NSTEMI.
   .
   #. Hypoxia: Hypoxia felt most likely due to acute aspiration event (but
   without development of aspiration pneumonia) and/or from volume
   overload in setting of CHF flare (c/w CXR findings, though pt not
   volume overloaded on exam) in setting of NSTEMI.
   Patient does have a history of aspiration pneumonia with possible
   aspiration event at rehab facility and mild fever and elevated WBC on
   presentation (both resolved now and may be explained by UTI), left
   sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with atelectasis.  Pt was
   treated for prior PNA with Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].
   Sputum growing gram positive cocci but culture with sparse commensals
   only.
   -  Treated with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover aspiration PNA pending
   speciation of sputum ([**Date range (1) 12158**]); discontinued as felt presentation
   more c/w fluid overload vs pneumonia
   - Exam much improved today; oxygen requirement decreasing: wean as
   tolerated
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema for goal even I/Os today (dose PRN)
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down but troponin
   slightly up 4/15. TTE with new abnormality in inferolateral wall.
   Lipids wnl (LDL 76).
   - Recheck cardiac biomarkers this afternoon; if still elevated will
   begin to trend
   - Daily EKG
   - Appreciate cardiology recs: will accept pt for cath on Monday and
   transfer of pt to service; team requests description of pt
s anatomy
   s/p CABG (have [**Name (NI) 420**] medical records office; awaiting report)
   - Received heparin gtt for 48 hours (ended [**5-22**])
   - Continue lopressor and uptitrate to home dose, ASA, statin; add back
   enalopril as tolerated by blood pressure
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles: coag-negative staph; most likely contaminant vs
   PICC colonization. PICC pulled [**5-22**].
   - follow up culture results (repeat blood cultures from [**5-22**] and PICC
   tip culture)
   .
   # Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection vs ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure
   of anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs but
   episode of hypoglycemia in AM [**5-23**]: decreased back to 25 last night
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs from yesterday: do not stack insulin bolus (no repeat use
   of ss w/in 4 hours since last dose); reduce lantus from 30 to 28;
   increase sliding scale by 1 unit per interval but only give q6h with
   possible additional correction if needed (and only if it is >4 hours
   since last bolus)
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, presented with acute
   renal failure to Cr 2.2, now resolved.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal with
   dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Enalapril okay to restart per renal team
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
 will recheck qod
   .
   #.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L initially.
   - Renal recs: Pt receiving free water boluses, 250 cc q2h
   - [**Hospital1 **] Na to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex to maintain even fluid balance
   .
   #. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue prednisone, cellcept, tacrolimus
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   #. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro for previous UTI, last day to be
   [**5-20**]. Now with E. Coli UTI on [**5-20**]. Pan-resistant except to
   nitrofurantoin (contraindicated in renal insufficiency) and cefepime,
   ceftriaxone, ceftaz.
   - Cefepime 1gm IV q 24 hours (day 1 = [**5-20**], 7 day course to end [**5-27**])
   .
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, TFs (novasource with free water flushes).
   Check CXR for tube placement given pt may have dislodged it yesterday.
   Speech and swallow video study pending; pt may need PEG for permanently
   feeding solution given recurrent silent aspiration events in past.
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; PPI; pneumoboots
   # Access: PIV
   # Communication: Wife and daughter
   # Code:  Full per prior admission, not yet discussed again with family
   # Disposition: Call out to cardiology. PT consult made.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   possible  aspiration event with hypoxia, DKA and NSTEMI.
   .
   #. Hypoxia: Hypoxia felt most likely due to acute aspiration event (but
   without development of aspiration pneumonia) and/or from volume
   overload in setting of CHF flare (c/w CXR findings, though pt not
   volume overloaded on exam) in setting of NSTEMI.
   Patient does have a history of aspiration pneumonia with possible
   aspiration event at rehab facility and mild fever and elevated WBC on
   presentation (both resolved now and may be explained by UTI), left
   sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with atelectasis.  Pt was
   treated for prior PNA with Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].
   Sputum growing gram positive cocci but culture with sparse commensals
   only.
   -  Treated with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover aspiration PNA pending
   speciation of sputum ([**Date range (1) 12158**]); discontinued as felt presentation
   more c/w fluid overload vs pneumonia
   - Exam much improved today; oxygen requirement decreasing: wean as
   tolerated
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema for goal even I/Os today (dose PRN)
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down but troponin
   slightly up 4/15. TTE with new abnormality in inferolateral wall.
   Lipids wnl (LDL 76).
   - Recheck cardiac biomarkers this afternoon; if still elevated will
   begin to trend
   - Daily EKG
   - Appreciate cardiology recs: will accept pt for cath on Monday and
   transfer of pt to service; team requests description of pt
s anatomy
   s/p CABG (have [**Name (NI) 420**] medical records office; awaiting report)
   - Received heparin gtt for 48 hours (ended [**5-22**])
   - Continue lopressor and uptitrate to home dose, ASA, statin; add back
   enalopril as tolerated by blood pressure
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles: coag-negative staph; most likely contaminant vs
   PICC colonization. PICC pulled [**5-22**].
   - follow up culture results (repeat blood cultures from [**5-22**] and PICC
   tip culture)
   .
   # Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection vs ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure
   of anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs but
   episode of hypoglycemia in AM [**5-23**]: decreased back to 25 last night
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs from yesterday: do not stack insulin bolus (no repeat use
   of ss w/in 4 hours since last dose); reduce lantus from 30 to 28;
   increase sliding scale by 1 unit per interval but only give q6h with
   possible additional correction if needed (and only if it is >4 hours
   since last bolus)
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, presented with acute
   renal failure to Cr 2.2, now resolved.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal with
   dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Enalapril okay to restart per renal team
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
 will recheck qod
   .
   #.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L initially.
   - Renal recs: Pt receiving free water boluses, 250 cc q2h
   - [**Hospital1 **] Na to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex to maintain even fluid balance
   .
   #. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue prednisone, cellcept, tacrolimus
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   #. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro for previous UTI, last day to be
   [**5-20**]. Now with E. Coli UTI on [**5-20**]. Pan-resistant except to
   nitrofurantoin (contraindicated in renal insufficiency) and cefepime,
   ceftriaxone, ceftaz.
   - Cefepime 1gm IV q 24 hours (day 1 = [**5-20**], 7 day course to end [**5-27**])
   .
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, TFs (novasource with free water flushes).
   Check CXR for tube placement given pt may have dislodged it yesterday.
   Speech and swallow video study pending; pt may need PEG for permanently
   feeding solution given recurrent silent aspiration events in past.
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; PPI; pneumoboots
   # Access: PIV
   # Communication: Wife and daughter
   # Code:  Full per prior admission, not yet discussed again with family
   # Disposition: Call out to cardiology. PT consult made.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old man with history of multiple strokes, type one diabetesI
   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   witnessed aspiration event with DKA and NSTEMI.
   #. Hypoxia: Hypoxia felt most likely due to acute aspiration event (but
   without development of aspiration pneumonia) and/or from volume
   overload in setting of CHF flare (c/w CXR findings) in setting of
   NSTEMI (though pt not volume overloaded on exam).
   Patient does have a history of aspiration pneumonia with possible
   aspiration event at rehab facility and mild fever and elevated WBC on
   presentation (both resolved now and may be explained by UTI), left
   sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with atelectasis.  Pt was
   treated for prior PNA with Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].
   Sputum growing gram positive cocci but culture with sparse commensals
   only.
   -  Initially treated with abx with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover
   aspiration pending speciation of sputum ([**Date range (1) 12158**]); discontinued as
   felt presentation more c/w fluid overload vs pneumonia
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema for goal even I/Os today (dose PRN)
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down but troponin
   slightly up today [**5-23**]
   - f/u cardiac biomarkers
   - Daily EKG
   - TTE with new abnormality in inferolateral wall
   - Appreciate cardiology recs: will accept pt for cath on Monday and
   transfer of pt to service; team requests description of pt
s anatomy
   s/p CABG
   - heparin gtt for 48 hours (ended [**5-22**])
   - Follow-up lipid panel from admission labs
   - Continue lopressor, ASA, enalapril, statin
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles: coag-negative staph; most likely contaminant vs
   PICC colonization. PICC pulled [**5-22**].
   - follow up culture results (repeat blood cultures from [**5-22**] and PICC
   tip culture)
   - Request new PICC placement today?
   .
   # Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection vs ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure
   of anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs but
   episode of hypoglycemia in AM [**5-23**]: will decrease back to 25 tonight
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, presented with acute
   renal failure to Cr 2.2, now resolving.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal
   with dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.
   - renally dose medication
   - Enalapril restarted [**5-22**] (discussed with renal); will hold today in
   order to allow for BB (pressures drop to 80s with both meds)
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
   - trend creatinine
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes
   .
   #.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L
   - Renal recs: transition to free water boluses by tube feed as
   tolerated: pt receiving 250 cc q6h, but remains hypernatremic. Plan to
   increase to 250 cc q4h.
   - Q6 hr chemistry to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex as above
   .
   #. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue tacrolimus at current dose
   - continue prednisone, cellcept
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   #. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro, last day to be [**5-20**]. Now with E.
   Coli UTI.
   - Cefepime 1gm IV q 24 hours day 1 = [**5-20**], 7 day course to end [**5-27**]
   - Confirm foley was replaced
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, TFs (novasource with free water flushes)
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; PPI; pneumoboots; change colace to
   PRN
   # Access: PIV

Summary:

The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of multiple strokes, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. He was admitted to the ICU after a witnessed aspiration event with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He has been treated with antibiotics, insulin, and other medications. His current status is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient is intubated and receiving oxygen therapy. His SpO2 is 97%. He has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is at risk for further respiratory complications.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has NSTEMI and is being treated with heparin, aspirin, and statins. He has new T wave inversions and elevated cardiac biomarkers.
* Renal: The patient has acute renal failure, with a baseline creatinine of 1-1.3 and a current creatinine of 2.2. He is receiving renally adjusted medications and is being monitored for electrolyte imbalances.
* Endocrine: The patient has DKA and is being treated with insulin. He has a history of recurrent UTIs and is being treated with antibiotics.
* Neurological: The patient has a history of multiple strokes and is at risk for further neurological complications.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is at risk for further respiratory complications due to his history of aspiration pneumonia and his current intubation.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has NSTEMI and is at risk for further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure and is at risk for further renal complications, such as chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs and is at risk for further infections, such as pneumonia or sepsis.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of multiple strokes and is at risk for further neurological complications, such as seizures or cognitive decline.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and adjust his oxygen therapy as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's NSTEMI with heparin, aspirin, and statins.
3. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust his medications as needed.
4. Continue to treat the patient's UTI with antibiotics.
5. Monitor the patient's neurological status and adjust his treatment as needed.
6. Consider referring the patient to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of his NSTEMI.
7. Consider referring the patient to a nephrologist for further evaluation and management of his acute renal failure.
8. Consider referring the patient to a urologist for further evaluation and management of his recurrent UTIs."

   and recurrent aspiration PNA s/p tracheostomy who presents after
   possible  aspiration event with hypoxia, DKA and NSTEMI.
   #. Hypoxia: Hypoxia felt most likely due to acute aspiration event (but
   without development of aspiration pneumonia) and/or from volume
   overload in setting of CHF flare (c/w CXR findings, though pt not
   volume overloaded on exam) in setting of NSTEMI.
   Patient does have a history of aspiration pneumonia with possible
   aspiration event at rehab facility and mild fever and elevated WBC on
   presentation (both resolved now and may be explained by UTI), left
   sided infiltrate on imaging consistent with atelectasis.  Pt was
   treated for prior PNA with Cefepime/Azithromycin which ended [**2182-5-13**].
   Sputum growing gram positive cocci but culture with sparse commensals
   only.
   -  Treated with vanc/cefepime/flagyl to cover aspiration PNA pending
   speciation of sputum ([**Date range (1) 12158**]); discontinued as felt presentation
   more c/w fluid overload vs pneumonia
   - Exam much improved today; oxygen requirement decreasing: wean as
   tolerated
   - Bumex for pulmonary edema for goal even I/Os today (dose PRN)
   #. NSTEMI: Patient with new T wave inversions anteriorly and elevated
   cardiac biomarkers.  Cardiac enzymes now trending down but troponin
   slightly up 4/15. TTE with new abnormality in inferolateral wall.
   Lipids wnl (LDL 76).
   - Recheck cardiac biomarkers this afternoon; if still elevated will
   begin to trend
   - Daily EKG
   - Appreciate cardiology recs: will accept pt for cath on Monday and
   transfer of pt to service; team requests description of pt
s anatomy
   s/p CABG (have [**Name (NI) 420**] medical records office; awaiting report)
   - Received heparin gtt for 48 hours (ended [**5-22**])
   - Continue lopressor, ASA, statin; add back enalopril as tolerated by
   blood pressure
   .
   # GPC in
 bottles: coag-negative staph; most likely contaminant vs
   PICC colonization. PICC pulled [**5-22**].
   - follow up culture results (repeat blood cultures from [**5-22**] and PICC
   tip culture)
   .
   # Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Patient with hyperglycemia, anion gap in the
   twenties, and ketones in the urine on admission.  Precipitant likely
   infection vs ischemia.  Patient treated with insulin gtt with closure
   of anion gap and return to normoglycemia.
   - continue home dose glargine, increased to 30 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) **] recs but
   episode of hypoglycemia in AM [**5-23**]: decreased back to 25 last night
   - [**Last Name (un) 276**] recs from yesterday: do not stack insulin bolus (no repeat use
   of ss w/in 4 hours since last dose); reduce lantus from 30 to 28;
   increase sliding scale by 1 unit per interval but only give q6h with
   possible additional correction if needed (and only if it is >4 hours
   since last bolus)
   - continue home sliding scale
   - f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 276**] recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Baseline creatinine 1-1.3, presented with acute
   renal failure to Cr 2.2, now resolved.  FeNa 0.2. Likely pre-renal with
   dehydration due to osmotic diuresis in the setting of DKA.
   - Renally dose medications
   - Enalapril okay to restart per renal team
   - renal transplant recs: monitor CK in setting of pravastatin and
   tacrolimus interaction
 will recheck qod
   .
   #.Hypernatremia:  Likely due to decreased access to free water.  Free
   water deficit calculated at 3L initially.
   - Renal recs: Pt receiving free water boluses, 250 cc q2h
   - [**Hospital1 **] Na to monitor sodium correction
   - Bumex to maintain even fluid balance
   .
   #. Immunosuppression: s/p cadaveric renal transplant [**2175**]
   - check tacrolimus level (goal last admission [**4-13**])
   - continue prednisone, cellcept, tacrolimus
   - f/u transplant recs
   - continue bactrim ppx
   .
   #. Recurrent UTI: s/p 7 days of Cipro for previous UTI, last day to be
   [**5-20**]. Now with E. Coli UTI on [**5-20**]. Pan-resistant except to
   nitrofurantoin (contraindicated in renal insufficiency) and cefepime,
   ceftriaxone, ceftaz.
   - Cefepime 1gm IV q 24 hours (day 1 = [**5-20**], 7 day course to end [**5-27**])
   .
   # FEN: Replete electrolytes, TFs (novasource with free water flushes).
   Check CXR for tube placement given pt may have dislodged it yesterday.
   Speech and swallow video study pending; pt may need PEG for permanently
   feeding solution given recurrent silent aspiration events in past.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the physician's daily progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of multiple strokes, type one diabetes, and recurrent aspiration pneumonia who presents with hypoxia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has undergone a tracheostomy and is receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of recurrent aspiration pneumonia, and the recent aspiration event may have led to a new episode of pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) recurrence: The patient's DKA has resolved, but there is a risk of recurrence, especially if the patient's diabetes is not well-controlled.
4. NSTEMI complications: The patient's NSTEMI may lead to cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
5. Renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine was 1-1.3, and he presented with acute renal failure, which has since resolved. However, there is a risk of recurrent renal failure, especially if the patient's diabetes is not well-controlled.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which may lead to complications such as seizures, coma, or death.
7. Immunosuppression: The patient is immunosuppressed due to his history of cadaveric renal transplant, which increases his risk of developing infections.
8. Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs): The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs, and there is a risk of developing another UTI, especially if the patient is not receiving adequate antibiotic prophylaxis.
9. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's recent aspiration event may have led to gastrointestinal complications such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
10. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure or arrest.

To mitigate these risks, the patient should be closely monitored for any signs of complications, and the healthcare team should work to optimize his care, including managing his diabetes, blood pressure, and electrolyte levels, as well as providing adequate antibiotic prophylaxis and immunosuppressive therapy."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old man with a tracheostomy, admitted with STEMI, pulmonary edema, and respiratory failure. He is communicative and interactive but delirious. He has a history of allergies to Lasix, betalactams, and Haldol. He has received multiple antibiotics, including Vancomycin, Metronidazole, Ceftriaxone, and Cefipime. His current medications include Heparin, insulin, Lopressor, Pravastatin, Prevacid, Bactrim, Colace, FK506, Fluvoxamine, and Fexofenadine.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, and blood pressure of 140/52 mmHg. He has a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute and an SpO2 of 100%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.31, pCO2 of 31 mmHg, and pO2 of 100 mmHg.

The patient's physical examination reveals normal cardiovascular and peripheral vascular findings. His respiratory exam shows rhonchorous breath sounds. His skin exam is not assessed. His neurologic exam shows that he responds to verbal commands but does not move or have tone.

Lab results show:

* Hb: 9.5 g/dL
* WBC: 11.3 K/uL
* Platelet count: 26 K/uL
* Creatinine: 2.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 1.47 ng/mL
* Glucose: 84 mg/dL
* Other lab results show normal ranges for electrolytes, liver enzymes, and coagulation studies.

The patient has a history of pulmonary edema, NSTEMI, and renal failure. He is currently receiving Bumex to manage his fluid balance and has a PIC line colonization without evidence of bacteremia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is 17 breaths per minute, and his ABG results show a pH of 7.31, indicating hypoxemia. He may require further oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation to manage his respiratory failure.
2. NSTEMI: The patient's troponin-T levels are elevated, indicating NSTEMI. He may require further management with antiplatelet agents, beta blockers, and statins to manage his cardiac condition.
3. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal failure. He may require further management with dialysis or medication to manage his renal function.
4. UTI: The patient is receiving cefepime for 7 days to manage his UTI. He may require further management with antibiotics or other medications to manage his infection.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, indicating hypernatremia. He may require further management with fluid therapy or medication to manage his sodium levels.
6. DVT prophylaxis: The patient is receiving DVT prophylaxis with boots, but he may require further management with anticoagulation therapy to manage his risk of DVT.
7. Stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis with H2 blockers, but he may require further management with antacids or proton pump inhibitors to manage his risk of stress ulceration.
8. VAP prophylaxis: The patient is receiving VAP prophylaxis with H2 blockers, but he may require further management with antacids or proton pump inhibitors to manage his risk of VAP.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management to address his multiple medical conditions and potential complications."
