   metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma presents with AMS and agitation.
   24 Hour Events:
 EEG - At [**2176-1-27**] 01:14 PM
   - Called [**Hospital 910**] Hospital at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10660**] #7915 (West 2). Risperidone
   caused prolonged QTc. Urine grew > 100,000 Enterococcus faecalis
   sensitive to Ampicillin, Nitrofurantoin, Vancomycin. Baseline BPs
   90-110/40-65.
   - Mental status improved in AM, less somnolent. Agitated pulling lines.
   Started Zyprexa without response. Haldol 0.5mg - 1mg.
   - Final CT Head: There are continued evolution of post-surgical
   changes, with decreasing pneumocephalus, decreasing edema surrounding
   the right frontal resection bed, as well as decreased hyperdensity
   within the resection bed representing resolving blood products. Tiny
   new hyperdensity within the resection bed likely represents resolving
   blood products. Otherwise, no acute intracranial hemorrhage or new
   edema is seen.
   - Final CXR: No pneumonia seen. Left hilar mass as before.
   - Neurosurgery: Restart Heparin SC, EEG, MRI with contrast.
   - Family updated and ICU consent signed.
   - MRI deferred until tomorrow given agitation and pressure support.
   - Meds (including steroids) converted to IV
   - EEG performed: Pending
   - Advanced diet.

   Assessment and Plan
   70 y/o F s/p R frontal mass resection [**2176-1-12**] metastatic
   rhabdomyosarcoma presents with AMS and agitation.
   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT stable s/p resection. Lesion/site of resection accounts for
   symptoms. Therefore mental status essentially as clear as might be
   expected based on CT findings. Delerium yesterday likely relates to
   underlying infection. Some signs likely resulting from edema and
   therefore some improvement necessary.
   - Treat urosepsis as below
   - Discontinue hydromorphone, limit sedating medications
   # Urosepsis
   Per discharge report from rehab enterococcus in urine. Unfortunately no
   urine culture sent in ED, Ua positive.
   - IVF 1 L NS
   - Start ampicillin for enterococcus coverage and ceftriaxone for e.coli
   -> can narrow once final cultures
   # s/p right frontal mass resection
   CT head changes consistent with post-op peroid, no acute changes.
   Neurosurgery evaluated in ED and felt no acute neurosurg issues.
   - Neurosurg to follow, appreciate input
   - Continue dexamethasone, Keppra
   - Xenaderm ointment to scar
   - Insulin sliding scale, Bactrim ppx while on dexamethasone
   # Malignancy: Patient with history of stage IV thoracic
   rhabdomyosarcoma currently on chemotherapy. Path from right frontal
   lesion confirms metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma. Also history of L breast
   cancer - DCIS s/p lumpectomy.
   - Patient to follow-up cancer care as outpatient

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old female who underwent a right frontal mass resection on January 12th due to metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma. She presented with altered mental status (AMS) and agitation. The patient's condition has been unstable, with ongoing urosepsis and respiratory support. She has been receiving antibiotics, including ampicillin and ceftriaxone, and has been treated with Risperidone, Haldol, and Zyprexa for agitation. Her mental status has improved, but she remains somnolent and agitated. She has also been experiencing confusion, acalculia, and a mild corticospinal tract syndrome on the left.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Urosepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing urosepsis due to the presence of Enterococcus faecalis in her urine. This can lead to septic shock, organ failure, and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is at risk of developing respiratory failure due to her chronic lung disease and the presence of a left hilar mass.
3. Sepsis: The patient has a high risk of developing sepsis due to her urosepsis and the presence of a central line. This can lead to organ failure, shock, and death.
4. Malignancy: The patient has a history of stage IV thoracic rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancer, and she is at risk of developing further metastases.
5. Neurological complications: The patient has a mild corticospinal tract syndrome on the left and may be at risk of developing further neurological complications due to her underlying cancer and treatment.
6. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing infection due to her immunocompromised state and the presence of a central line.
7. Bleeding: The patient has a high risk of bleeding due to her anticoagulation therapy and the presence of a central line.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and provide respiratory support as needed.
2. Continue to treat the patient's urosepsis with antibiotics and fluids.
3. Monitor the patient's neurological status and provide supportive care as needed.
4. Continue to provide chemotherapy for the patient's rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancer.
5. Monitor the patient's blood counts and adjust her anticoagulation therapy as needed.
6. Monitor the patient's central line and remove it if necessary.
7. Provide prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcer."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Chief Complaint: 70 y/o F s/p R frontal mass resection [**2176-1-12**]
   metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma presents with AMS and agitation.
   24 Hour Events:
 EEG - At [**2176-1-27**] 01:14 PM
   - Called [**Hospital 910**] Hospital at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10660**] #7915 (West 2). Risperidone
   caused prolonged QTc. Urine grew > 100,000 Enterococcus faecalis
   sensitive to Ampicillin, Nitrofurantoin, Vancomycin. Baseline BPs
   90-110/40-65.
   - Mental status improved in AM, less somnolent. Agitated pulling lines.
   Started Zyprexa without response. Haldol 0.5mg - 1mg.
   - Final CT Head: There are continued evolution of post-surgical
   changes, with decreasing pneumocephalus, decreasing edema surrounding
   the right frontal resection bed, as well as decreased hyperdensity
   within the resection bed representing resolving blood products. Tiny
   new hyperdensity within the resection bed likely represents resolving
   blood products. Otherwise, no acute intracranial hemorrhage or new
   edema is seen.
   - Final CXR: No pneumonia seen. Left hilar mass as before.
   - Neurosurgery: Restart Heparin SC, EEG, MRI with contrast.
   - Family updated and ICU consent signed.
   - MRI deferred until tomorrow given agitation and pressure support.
   - Meds (including steroids) converted to IV
   - EEG performed: Pending
   - Advanced diet.

Summary:

The patient, a 70-year-old female, is a post-operative patient with a right frontal mass resection due to metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma. She is experiencing altered mental status (AMS) and agitation, which is likely secondary to urosepsis, as evidenced by a positive urine culture. The patient is receiving IV antibiotics, including ampicillin and ceftriaxone, for enterococcus coverage. She is also receiving sedation with Haldol and Ativan.

The patient has a history of stage IV thoracic rhabdomyosarcoma and is currently on chemotherapy. She also has a history of left breast cancer with DCIS and underwent lumpectomy.

The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving IV fluids, vasopressors, and oxygen support. She has a double-lumen port and is receiving prophylactic antibiotics for DVT and stress ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's urosepsis is a significant risk factor for developing sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's agitation and altered mental status may lead to respiratory failure, particularly if she becomes more somnolent or develops respiratory depression.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and vasopressor dependence increase her risk for cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's history of brain surgery and metastatic disease increase her risk for neurological complications, such as seizures, cerebral edema, or stroke.
5. Infection: The patient's positive urine culture and receipt of IV antibiotics increase her risk for developing other infections, such as pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
6. Bleeding Complications: The patient's history of brain surgery and receipt of anticoagulant therapy increase her risk for bleeding complications, such as intracranial hemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's inability to eat and receive adequate nutrition may lead to malnutrition, which can exacerbate her underlying medical conditions and increase her risk for complications.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management in the ICU to prevent and address potential medical complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old male who underwent a right frontal mass resection for metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma. He is currently in the ICU due to sepsis and altered mental status.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.1°F)
* Heart rate: 111 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 97/48 mmHg (85/40 mmHg - 122/84 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 21 breaths per minute
* SpO2: 94%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Dry mouth
* No chest pain
* No abdominal pain
* Confusion
* Right lower extremity edema: Trace
* Left lower extremity edema: Trace
* Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Warm skin
* Attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to stimuli

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 5.8 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 25.5%
* Platelet count: 222 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Glucose: 88 mg/dL
* Other lab results include:

PT/PTT/INR: 12.6/24.6/1.1
Ca++: 9.1 mg/dL
Mg++: 2.5 mg/dL
PO4: 2.2 mg/dL

The patient's diagnosis is:

* Sepsis of urinary tract origin
* Altered mental status
* Malignancy: stage IV thoracic rhabdomyosarcoma

The patient's plan includes:

* Limit sedating medications
* Continue antibiotics (ampicillin and ceftriaxone)
* Continue dexamethasone and keppra
* Follow-up with neurosurgery
* Continue chemotherapy

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Worsening sepsis
* Increased risk of bleeding due to platelet count
* Increased risk of infection due to compromised immune system
* Increased risk of respiratory failure due to sepsis
* Increased risk of cardiac arrest due to sepsis
* Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy
* Increased risk of electrolyte imbalance due to chemotherapy and antibiotics

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis due to a known UTI, which was not treated during their stay at a rehabilitation facility. They have altered mental status, disoriented to numeric year, and acalculic. The patient has been off levophed since January 28th and has been on room air and regular diet. They have a Foley catheter in place.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a Tmax of 36.4°C, Tcurrent of 36.1°C, HR of 106 bpm, BP of 110/56 mmHg, RR of 27 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 100%. They have a sinus tachycardia rhythm.

The patient has a history of UTI, with Enterococcus faecalis growing in their urine culture, which is sensitive to Ampicillin, Nitrofurantoin, and Vancomycin. They have altered mental status, which is not delirium, and hypotension, which is not shock.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* WBC: 4.3 K/uL
* Hct: 29.5%
* Plt: 204 K/uL
* Cr: 0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 108 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.6/24.6/1.1, Ca++: 9.0 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL, PO4: 2.8 mg/dL

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis progression: The patient's sepsis may worsen if not properly treated, leading to organ dysfunction or failure.
2. UTI treatment failure: The patient's UTI may not be fully treated, leading to persistent infection and potentially life-threatening complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may worsen, leading to organ hypoperfusion and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may worsen, leading to increased risk of falls, injury, and poor wound healing.
5. Corticospinal tract syndrome: The patient's mild corticospinal tract syndrome on the left may worsen, leading to increased risk of neurologic deficits.
6. Pneumonia: The patient's poor effort on lung examination and possible aspiration risk may lead to pneumonia.
7. DVT: The patient's immobility and potential thrombophilia may increase their risk of DVT.
8. VAP: The patient's respiratory support and potential aspiration risk may increase their risk of VAP."

   # Altered Mental Status
   Head CT stable s/p resection. Lesion/site of resection accounts for
   symptoms. Therefore mental status essentially as clear as might be
   expected based on CT findings. Delerium yesterday likely relates to
   underlying infection. Some signs likely resulting from edema and
   therefore some improvement necessary.
   - Mental status continues to improve although pleasantly confused
   (close to baseline per family)
   - Continue to re-orient, OOB to chair etc.
   - Treat urosepsis as below
   - Discontinued hydromorphone yesterday, limit sedating medications
   # Urosepsis: Urine from [**Hospital3 1714**] culture grew > 100,000
   Enterococcus faecalis sensitive to Ampicillin, Nitrofurantoin,
   Vancomycin.
   Per discharge report from rehab, enterococcus in urine. Unfortunately
   no urine culture sent in ED, although urinalysis was positive. Patient
   continues to do well off levophed
   - Discontinued Ceftriaxone for enterococcus sensitive to ampicillin
   - Continue ampicillin Day 3
   # s/p right frontal mass resection
   CT head changes consistent with post-op peroid, no acute changes.
   Neurosurgery evaluated in ED and felt no acute neurosurg issues.
   - Neurosurgery continues to follow, appreciate input
   - Continue dexamethasone, Keppra
 will clarify with Neurosurgery
   planned course
   - Continue Bactrim ppx given dexamethasone
   - Xenaderm ointment to scar
   # Malignancy: Patient with history of stage IV thoracic
   rhabdomyosarcoma currently on chemotherapy. Path from right frontal

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old female who underwent a right frontal mass resection for metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma. She was admitted to the ICU due to sepsis and altered mental status. The patient has a history of stage IV thoracic rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancer (DCIS). Her mental status has been improving, and she is now pleasant and conversant, although still disoriented. She has a Foley catheter in place and is receiving antibiotics for a known UTI.

24-hour events:

* No head MRI was performed yesterday due to expected edema and syndrome based on the site of resection.
* The patient was called out yesterday but did not move.
* Levophed was discontinued on January 28th, and her blood pressure is now stable.
* The patient is receiving regular diet and has a good urine output.

Lab results:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 5.8, Hct 29.5, Plt 204
* Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 27 mg/dL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 108 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na 142 mEq/L, K 4.3 mEq/L, Cl 107 mEq/L
* Other labs: PT 12.6, PTT 24.6, INR 1.1, Ca++ 9.0 mg/dL, Mg++ 1.8 mg/dL, PO4 2.8 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

* Sepsis: The patient's UTI is a potential source of sepsis, which could lead to organ failure, septic shock, and death.
* Corticospinal tract syndrome: The patient's left-sided corticospinal tract syndrome could lead to weakness, numbness, or paralysis of the left side of her body.
* Pneumonia: The patient's poor lung effort and respiratory support could lead to pneumonia, which could worsen her respiratory status.
* DVT: The patient is at risk for DVT due to her immobility and history of cancer, which could lead to pulmonary embolism.
* Infection: The patient's wound could become infected, leading to further complications and sepsis.
* Malignancy: The patient's history of rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancer (DCIS) increases her risk of developing further metastases or recurrence.
* Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's poor appetite and malnutrition could lead to deficiencies in essential nutrients, which could worsen her overall health."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a known UTI, refusing antibiotics at the rehab facility, and presenting with altered mental status. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 106 bpm (96-126 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 110/56 mmHg (68-121/84 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 27 inspirations per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 100%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General: Alert and oriented to person, place, and time, but pleasantly confused
* HEENT: Dry mucous membranes, eyes move to left, nasal congestion, and right parietal surgical incision site
* Neck: Supple, jugular venous pressure not elevated, no lymphadenopathy
* Lungs: Clear throughout, poor effort
* CV: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
* Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds present, no rebound tenderness or guarding, no organomegaly
* GU: Foley catheter in place
* Ext: Warm, well-perfused, 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema
* Neuro: CNs II-XII intact, tone normal, confusion, and acalculia

Laboratory results indicate:

* White blood cell count: 5.8 K/uL
* Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL
* Platelet count: 222 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Glucose: 108 mg/dL
* Other labs: PT/PTT/INR: 12.6/24.6/1.1, Ca++: 9.0 mg/dL, Mg++: 1.8 mg/dL, PO4: 2.8 mg/dL

The patient has a UTI with Enterococcus faecalis sensitive to Ampicillin, Nitrofurantoin, and Vancomycin. They are also experiencing altered mental status, not delirium, and hypotension, not shock.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's UTI can lead to sepsis, especially if the infection is not properly treated.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's altered mental status and hypotension can lead to organ dysfunction, including cardiac, respiratory, and renal failure.
3. Delirium: Although the patient's mental status is not delirium, there is a risk of developing delirium due to the underlying infection and potential medication side effects.
4. Worsening of UTI: If the UTI is not properly treated, it can worsen, leading to more severe complications.
5. Development of secondary infections: The patient's compromised immune system due to the UTI and altered mental status can increase the risk of developing secondary infections.

Based on the patient's condition, it is essential to continue monitoring their vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to ensure prompt detection and treatment of any potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of stage IV thoracic rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancer who underwent a right frontal mass resection on [**2176-1-12**] for metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma. She was transferred to the ICU from rehab due to sepsis and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Vital signs: Tmax 36.4°C, Tcurrent 36.1°C, HR 106 bpm, BP 110/56 mmHg, RR 27 inspirations per minute, SpO2 100%.
* Hemodynamic monitoring: SBP 90-120 mmHg, no levophed infusion since [**1-28**].
* Fluid balance: Total in 2,087 mL, total out 3,640 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,553 mL.
* Respiratory support: SpO2 100%, ABG: //27/.
* Physical examination: NAD, alert and oriented x1, pleasantly confused but conversant, dry mucous membranes, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm and well-perfused extremities.
* Laboratory results: WBC 5.8 K/uL, Hct 25.5%, Plt 222 K/uL, Cr 0.5 mg/dL, Glucose 88 mg/dL, other labs within normal limits.

The patient's medical complications and potential issues include:

* Urosepsis: The patient has a known UTI and was previously treated with ceftriaxone and ampicillin. The current antibiotic regimen includes ampicillin for enterococcus coverage and ceftriaxone for E. coli coverage.
* Corticospinal tract syndrome: The patient has a mild corticospinal tract syndrome on the left and parietal syndrome, which may improve with time.
* Malignancy: The patient has a history of stage IV thoracic rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancer, and her current condition is likely related to metastatic disease.
* Post-operative complications: The patient had a right frontal mass resection and may have post-operative complications such as wound infection, bleeding, or cerebral edema.
* Delirium: The patient has a history of delirium, which may be related to underlying infection, medication side effects, or other factors.
* Fluid imbalance: The patient has a negative fluid balance, which may indicate dehydration or excessive fluid loss.
* Respiratory compromise: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she may require further monitoring and support if her condition deteriorates.

Based on this information, the patient's care plan should include:

* Continued antibiotic treatment for urosepsis
* Monitoring for signs of post-operative complications
* Management of fluid balance and electrolyte levels
* Close monitoring of respiratory status
* Consideration of further diagnostic testing to rule out other potential causes of delirium and respiratory compromise
* Ongoing management of malignancy and cancer care."

Summary:

The patient is a 70-year-old female who underwent a right frontal mass resection for metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma on January 12th. She is currently in the ICU due to sepsis, altered mental status, and urosepsis. She has a history of stage IV thoracic rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancer (DCIS) treated with lumpectomy. The patient's mental status has been improving, and she is now alert and oriented to one person. However, she remains pleasantly confused and acalculic.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, and blood pressure of 110/56 mmHg. Her respiratory support is stable, with an SpO2 of 100% and ABG values of pH 7.27.

The patient's laboratory results show mild elevations in her white blood cell count, platelet count, and creatinine levels. Her electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level.

The patient's physical examination is notable for a dry mouth, mild cortical blindness, and a right parietal surgical incision site. Her neurological examination shows mild corticospinal tract syndrome on the left and parietal syndrome.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support is stable, but she has a history of respiratory failure, and her lungs are clear throughout.
2. Sepsis: The patient has urosepsis and sepsis, which can lead to further complications if not properly treated.
3. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and has undergone surgery, which can lead to neurological complications such as seizures, cognitive impairment, and weakness.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of infection, and her laboratory results show mild elevations in her white blood cell count and platelet count, which can indicate ongoing infection.
5. Bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding complications, and her laboratory results show mild elevations in her creatinine levels, which can indicate bleeding complications.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease, and her blood pressure is slightly elevated, which can lead to cardiovascular complications such as hypertension, heart failure, and arrhythmias.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal disease, and her laboratory results show mild elevations in her liver enzymes, which can indicate gastrointestinal complications such as liver dysfunction, pancreatitis, and bowel obstruction."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a septic individual with a known urinary tract infection (UTI) who has been refusing antibiotics at the rehabilitation center. They have altered mental status, particularly with disorientation to numeric years and acalculia, which is likely to improve with time if the resection was complete. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 106 beats per minute, and blood pressure ranging from 90-120 mmHg.

The patient has a history of codeine allergy and has received antibiotics in the past, including ceftriaxone and ampicillin. They are currently receiving other ICU medications and have a port catheter in place.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, and creatinine levels, indicating possible sepsis-related changes. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are also elevated, suggesting potential kidney damage.

The patient has a history of altered mental status, which may be related to the sepsis or the UTI. They have not been assessed for movement, tone, or responsiveness.

The patient's fluid balance is negative, with a total fluid input of 2,087 mL and output of 3,640 mL, indicating a significant fluid loss.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction, particularly in the kidneys and liver.
2. UTI-related complications, such as pyelonephritis or sepsis.
3. Hypotension-related complications, such as shock or organ failure.
4. Altered mental status-related complications, such as delirium or coma.
5. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.

The patient's care plan should focus on managing their sepsis, UTI, and altered mental status, as well as addressing their fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Close monitoring of their vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical status is essential to prevent potential complications and optimize their outcome."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a known urinary tract infection (UTI) and altered mental status. The patient has been off levophed since January 28th, and their blood pressure has been stable within the range of 90-120 mmHg.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 106 bpm (normal range: 96-126 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 110/56 mmHg (normal range: 91/40-121/84 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 27 breaths per minute (normal range: 16-28 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 100% (normal range: 95-100%)
* Heart rhythm: sinus tachycardia

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 5.8 K/uL (normal range: 4.3-10.7 K/uL)
* Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL (normal range: 12-16 g/dL)
* Platelet count: 222 K/uL (normal range: 150-450 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL (normal range: 0.5-1.1 mg/dL)
* Glucose: 88 mg/dL (normal range: 70-110 mg/dL)

The patient's physical examination is limited due to their altered mental status and inability to assess their peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis-related organ dysfunction: The patient's UTI can lead to sepsis, which may cause organ dysfunction, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal failure.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium, which can increase their risk of falls, aspiration, and other complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within a normal range, but they may still be at risk for hypotension, particularly if their sepsis worsens.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and their oxygen saturation is normal. However, they may still be at risk for respiratory failure, particularly if their sepsis worsens.
5. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is slightly elevated, and they may be at risk for renal failure, particularly if their sepsis worsens.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's heart rhythm is normal, but they may still be at risk for cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock, particularly if their sepsis worsens.
7. Worsening of UTI: The patient's UTI may worsen if they do not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy, which can lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypotension. The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.4°C (97.6°F)
* Heart rate: 106 bpm (96-126 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 110/56 mmHg (68-121/84 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 27 inspirations per minute (16-28)
* Oxygen saturation: 100%

The patient's physical examination is notable for:

* Well-nourished appearance
* No acute distress
* No signs of trauma or injury
* Normocephalic head
* Poor dentition
* No endotracheal tube, NG tube, or OG tube
* No cervical adenopathy
* Cardiovascular examination reveals a normal PMI, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and a holosystolic murmur at the apex

Laboratory results include:

* Hemoglobin: 9.9 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 5.8 K/uL
* Platelet count: 222 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 10 mg/dL
* Glucose: 88 mg/dL
* Electrolytes: Na 142 mEq/L, K 3.8 mEq/L, Cl 27 mEq/L

The patient's medical conditions include:

* Urinary tract infection (UTI)
* Altered mental status (not delirium)
* Hypotension (not shock)

The plan includes:

* Narrowing antibiotics to cover enterococcus
* Obtaining a culture from the previous hospital
* Checking thyroid function tests (TFTs)
* Speaking with the nephrology service regarding prednisone dosing and prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP)
* Transferring the patient to the floor once stabilized

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Sepsis due to the UTI or other underlying infections
* Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, due to the patient's tachycardia and hypertension
* Respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), due to the patient's respiratory rate and oxygen saturation
* Neurological complications, such as seizures or stroke, due to the patient's altered mental status
* Gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea and vomiting, due to the patient's hypotension and electrolyte imbalances
* Renal complications, such as acute kidney injury (AKI), due to the patient's hypotension and electrolyte imbalances."
