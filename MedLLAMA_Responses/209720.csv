You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a diagnosis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), admitted to the ICU for urgent plasmapheresis and chemotherapy. He has undergone plasmapheresis and received the first treatment of hydroxyurea. The patient is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation, coagulopathy, and acute renal failure. He has also developed tumor lysis syndrome, which is complicated by ARF. The patient's lab results show elevated troponin-T, CK, and LDH, indicating cardiac demand ischemia and potential end-organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): The patient is at risk of developing TLS, which can lead to acute kidney injury, cardiac arrhythmias, and even death.
2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's coagulopathy and elevated D-dimer levels suggest the possibility of DIC, which can lead to bleeding and organ failure.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate ARF, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and even death.
4. Cardiac Demand Ischemia: The patient's elevated troponin-T and CK levels suggest cardiac demand ischemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and even death.
5. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's elevated D-dimer levels and CXR findings suggest the possibility of PE, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
6. Leukostasis: The patient's elevated WBC count and platelet count suggest the possibility of leukostasis, which can lead to respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and even death.
7. Hyperviscosity Syndrome: The patient's elevated WBC count and platelet count suggest the possibility of hyperviscosity syndrome, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, respiratory failure, and even death.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient requires close monitoring and management of his various complications. He will need to be followed up with oncology notes, and his dose of hydroxyurea will be increased. He will also need to be monitored for symptoms relating to hyperviscosity syndrome. The patient's DIC will need to be closely monitored, and he will need to receive cryoprecipitate and platelet transfusions as needed. The patient's tumor lysis syndrome will need to be managed with rasburicase and IVF, and he will need to be monitored for signs of ARF. The patient's cardiac status will need to be closely monitored, and he will need to receive metoprolol and ASA as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 24-hour-old male with acute leukemia, currently in the ICU due to sepsis, coagulopathy, and atrial fibrillation. He received hydroxyurea 3000 mg PO TID x 1 day, which spiked his temperature to 101.6°F. He was administered 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 124/56 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His physical examination is unremarkable, except for an irregular heartbeat and a harsh systolic murmur.

Lab results show:

* WBC: 159.0 K/uL
* Hct: 31.0%
* Plt: 109 K/uL
* Cr: 2.8 mg/dL
* TropT: 0.21 ng/mL
* Glucose: 122 mg/dL

Radiology studies show:

* LENI: No DVT bilaterally
* TTE: Moderate aortic stenosis, symmetric LVH, normal regional and global biventricular systolic function, mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and LVEF>55%

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient's temperature has spiked to 101.6°F, which may indicate ongoing sepsis. Close monitoring of his temperature and blood cultures is necessary to ensure effective treatment.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's platelet count is low, and his PT and PTT are elevated, indicating coagulopathy. This may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's irregular heartbeat may increase the risk of thromboembolic complications, such as stroke or pulmonary embolism.
4. Leukemia: The patient's acute leukemia may lead to complications such as bleeding, infection, or organ dysfunction.
5. Malnutrition: The patient's poor oral intake may lead to malnutrition, which can exacerbate his underlying medical conditions.
6. Respiratory complications: The patient's pulmonary artery systolic hypertension may increase the risk of respiratory complications, such as respiratory failure or pneumonia.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's moderate aortic stenosis and symmetric LVH may increase the risk of cardiac complications, such as heart failure or arrhythmias.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical status to ensure effective treatment and prevention of potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

**Current Condition:**

* The patient is a 77-year-old male with a diagnosis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and is admitted to the ICU for urgent plasmapheresis and chemotherapy with hydroxyurea.
* He is experiencing hyperviscosity syndrome, which is likely complicating both cardiac and renal function.
* He has atrial fibrillation, and his cardiac function is compromised, with elevated troponin levels and ST elevations in V1-V3 on ECG.
* He has acute renal failure, with unknown baseline creatinine levels, and is at risk for further deterioration due to tumor lysis syndrome, DIC, or hypovolemia/poor cardiac output.
* He has anemia, likely secondary to AML, and is at risk for further deterioration.
* He has no signs of bleeding, but has increased PT/PTT, decreased fibrinogen, and increased LDH, which suggests disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

**Potential Medical Complications:**

* Tumor lysis syndrome, which can lead to acute kidney injury, cardiac arrhythmias, and electrolyte imbalances.
* Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can lead to bleeding, organ failure, and death.
* Acute respiratory failure, which can be caused by pulmonary emboli, pneumonia, or cardiac failure.
* Cardiac failure, which can be caused by demand ischemia, AS, or sludging from leukostasis.
* Severe anemia, which can lead to organ dysfunction and death.
* Infections, such as sepsis, pneumonia, or urinary tract infections, which can be exacerbated by immunosuppression.
* Bleeding, which can be caused by DIC, thrombocytopenia, or platelet dysfunction.

**Assessment and Plan:**

* The patient will continue to receive plasmapheresis and chemotherapy with hydroxyurea.
* The patient will be closely monitored for signs of tumor lysis syndrome, DIC, and cardiac failure.
* The patient will receive supportive care, including fluids, electrolyte replacement, and blood transfusions as needed.
* The patient will be closely monitored for signs of bleeding and will receive prophylactic anticoagulation therapy.
* The patient will be closely monitored for signs of infection and will receive antibiotics as needed.
* The patient will be closely monitored for signs of respiratory failure and will receive oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation as needed.
* The patient will be closely monitored for signs of cardiac failure and will receive inotropic support and vasopressors as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, GERD, and past atrial fibrillation (AF) who was admitted to the ICU for urgent plasmapheresis with a preliminary diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He has been treated with hydroxyurea and plasmapheresis, but continues to experience hyperviscosity syndrome, cardiac dysfunction, and acute renal failure (ARF). His laboratory results show elevated troponin, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and decreased fibrinogen and platelet count.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Tumor Lysis Syndrome: The patient's high LDH and D-dimer levels suggest the possibility of tumor lysis syndrome, which can lead to acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's elevated D-dimer and decreased fibrinogen levels indicate the possibility of DIC, which can lead to bleeding and thrombosis.
3. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's elevated troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels suggest cardiac dysfunction, which can lead to heart failure and arrhythmias.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output suggest acute renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and cardiovascular complications.
5. Leukostasis: The patient's high white blood cell count and elevated LDH levels suggest the possibility of leukostasis, which can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular complications.
6. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's elevated D-dimer and decreased fibrinogen levels suggest the possibility of pulmonary embolism, which can lead to respiratory failure and cardiovascular complications.
7. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ongoing atrial fibrillation can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke.
8. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level suggests anemia, which can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's laboratory results and vital signs closely.
2. Administer rasburicase to help prevent tumor lysis syndrome.
3. Continue plasmapheresis and hydroxyurea therapy to manage hyperviscosity syndrome.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and consider echocardiogram to assess cardiac dysfunction.
5. Manage acute renal failure with fluid therapy and diuretics as needed.
6. Consider anticoagulation therapy to prevent DIC and pulmonary embolism.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory function and consider bronchodilators as needed.
8. Consider consulting with a hematologist and oncologist to optimize the patient's care."

   likely complicating both cardiac and renal function. WBC trending
   towards normal levels s/p 4 treatment with hydroxyurea. AML
   complications including tumor lysis and DIC and end organ dysfunction
   with resolved cardiac demand ischemia and ARF.
   --f/u oncology notes. Oncology will hold on hydroxyurea today.

    # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline. Possible etiologies include
   ARF from tumor lysis syndrome, DIC, or hypovolemia/poor cardiac output
   (less likely). FeNa=2.9%, FeUrea=33%, so likely not pre-renal.

   # Anemia: Likely secondary to AML.
   - Trend CBC, transfuse for hct<25.
   - Transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs today.
   - Guaiac stools.
   # CHF/CV: Patient with BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 8924**] and CXR with cephalization
   suggestive of heart failure.  He is currently asymptomatic without
   dyspnea, orthopnea, chest pain, or PND. The patient also has an
   elevated TnT with flat CK in the setting of acute renal failure, likely
   representing demand ischemia.  One possible etiology is AS and sludging
   from leukostasis leading to demand ischemia and failure.  Another
   possible etiology is sludging leading to pulmonary emboli causing right
   heart failure and atrial fibrillation with CXR without significant
   pulmonary edema. ECG showing ST elevations in V1-V3.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the patient's progress note, here is a summary of the information:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer on lupron therapy, GERD, and past atrial fibrillation (AFib). He was admitted to the ICU for urgent plasmapheresis with a preliminary diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The patient has undergone chemotherapy with hydroxyurea and has received plasmapheresis. He has been experiencing symptoms of hyperviscosity syndrome, including fever, sore throat, and a high white blood cell count.

The patient has been diagnosed with the following conditions:

* AML with blasts, monocytic subtype on bone marrow
* Tumor lysis syndrome
* Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
* Acute renal failure (ARF)
* Atrial fibrillation
* Heart failure
* Leukemia-related anemia

The patient is currently receiving treatment for these conditions, including:

* Hydroxyurea for AML
* Cefepime and vancomycin for prophylaxis
* Cryoprecipitate and platelets for DIC
* Rasburicase for tumor lysis syndrome
* Furosemide for ARF
* Metoprolol for heart failure
* Pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis

The patient's vital signs are as follows:

* Temperature: 101.6°F
* Heart rate: 91 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 124/56 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 28 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 95%

The patient's laboratory results are as follows:

* White blood cell count: 159.0 K/μL
* Hemoglobin: 8.3 g/dL
* Platelet count: 109 K/μL
* Creatinine: 2.8 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.21 ng/mL
* Pro-BNP: [**Numeric Identifier 8924**]
* FeNa: 2.9%
* FeUrea: 33%

The patient's fluid balance is as follows:

* Total in: 5,094 mL
* Total out: 1,956 mL
* Balance: 3,138 mL

The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via a nasal cannula, with an oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's physical examination is as follows:

* General: Age-appropriate male in no acute distress
* Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT): Perrl, eomi, sclerae anicteric
* Cardiovascular: Irregular S1+S2, harsh IV/VI systolic murmur throughout the precordium radiating to the carotids
* Pulmonary: CTAB
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender abdomen
* Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema
* Neurological: Alert and oriented to person, place, and time

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

* Tumor lysis syndrome: Continued hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia
* Disseminated intravascular coagulation: Continued bleeding or thrombosis
* Acute renal failure: Continued worsening of renal function
* Atrial fibrillation: Continued arrhythmia and potential for stroke or thromboembolism
* Heart failure: Continued worsening of cardiac function and potential for cardiac arrest
* Leukemia-related anemia: Continued worsening of anemia and potential for bleeding or infection

It is essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient, a 77-year-old male, is a known case of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who was admitted to the ICU for urgent plasmapheresis. He has a history of prostate cancer, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and atrial fibrillation (AF). His current condition is complicated by electrolyte and fluid disorders, coagulopathy, and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's symptoms include confusion, non-productive cough, and tingling in the back of his throat. He has a poor appetite and low oral intake. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals an irregularly irregular heart rhythm, with a harsh IV/VI systolic murmur throughout the precordium radiating to the carotids. His lungs are clear, with bilateral crackles at the bases. He has no signs of bleeding, but his platelet count is low.

Laboratory results show:

* WBC: 65.2
* Hct: 29.3
* Plt: 107
* Cr: 2.7
* TropT: 0.18
* Glucose: 166
* Alk Phos: 0.4
* T Bili: 0.4
* Differential-Neuts: 78.5%
* Band: 0.0%
* Lymph: 12.3%
* Mono: 7.8%
* Eos: 1.2%
* D-dimer: 8897 ng/mL
* Fibrinogen: 428 mg/dL
* LDH: 118 IU/L
* Ca++: 7.7 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.1 mg/dL
* PO4: 5.4 mg/dL

The patient's condition is complicated by:

* Electrolyte and fluid disorders
* Coagulopathy
* Acute renal failure
* Leukemia
* Tumor lysis syndrome
* DIC
* Atrial fibrillation
* Cardiac demand ischemia
* ARF
* Hyperviscosity
* Hypovolemia
* Poor cardiac output

Potential medical complications that can arise:

* Worsening of ARF
* Bleeding due to coagulopathy
* Infection due to neutropenia
* Cardiac complications due to atrial fibrillation and cardiac demand ischemia
* Pulmonary embolism due to sludging
* Right heart failure due to pulmonary embolism
* Increased risk of stroke due to atrial fibrillation
* Increased risk of bleeding due to low platelet count
* Increased risk of infection due to neutropenia
* Increased risk of tumor lysis syndrome due to AML
* Increased risk of DIC due to AML
* Increased risk of cardiac complications due to AML

Assessment and plan:

* Continue plasmapheresis
* Continue chemotherapy with hydroxyurea
* Monitor for signs of bleeding and infection
* Monitor for signs of cardiac complications
* Monitor for signs of pulmonary embolism
* Continue anticoagulation with metoprolol
* Continue prophylaxis with cefepime and vancomycin
* Continue nutrition consult for poor oral intake
* Continue hydration with D51/2 NS @ 100 cc/hr
* Monitor for signs of tumor lysis syndrome
* Monitor for signs of DIC
* Continue monitoring of cardiac enzymes and troponin
* Continue monitoring of electrolytes and fluid status
* Continue monitoring of platelet count and bleeding risk
* Continue monitoring of white blood cell count and risk of infection
* Continue monitoring of renal function and risk of ARF."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 8877**] is a 77 year old gentleman with a PMH
   significant for prostate CA on lupron therapy, GERD, and past afib s/p
   cardioversion admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for urgent plasmapheresis with a
   preliminary diagnosis of AML.
   .
   #AML with blasts, monocytic subtype on bone marrow: Patient s/p
   plasmaphoresis, s/p chemo therapy with hydroxyurea. Hyperviscosity was
   likely complicating both cardiac and renal function. WBC trending
   towards normal levels s/p 4 treatment with hydroxyurea. AML
   complications included tumor lysis and DIC and end organ dysfunction
   with resolved cardiac demand ischemia and ARF.
   --f/u oncology notes. Oncology will hold on hydroxyurea today.
    --Obtain records about baseline CBC/chemistries from OSH
   .
   #UTI/fever: Patient had a fever while getting FFP transfusion. Patient
   has Group B streptococcus in urine culture. Patient is essentially
   neutropenic, so will treat for prophylaxis also.
   --Continue cefepime (started [**8-14**]) and vanco (started [**8-14**]) for
   prophylaxis.
   --f/u blood culture
   --f/u CXR results in AM
   #DIC: Patient currently has no signs of bleeding. Resolved DIC. Has
   increased PT/PTT, increased LDH, High FDPs and high D dimer.
   --check DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
   --goal for fibrinogen >100, INR<1.5, platelets >10. Give
   crypo/platelets as needed.
   .
   #Tumor lysis: complicated by ARF. Problem resolved.
   --tumor lysis labs [**Hospital1 7**].
   -- UOP of >100cc/hr, so will continue fluids at D51/2 NS @ 100 cc/hr.
   --Given dose of Rasburicase 6 mg x1
   --Continue allopurinol.
    # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline. Possible etiologies include
   ARF from tumor lysis syndrome, DIC, or hypovolemia/poor cardiac output
   (less likely). FeNa=2.9%, FeUrea=33%, so likely not pre-renal.  Likely
   a chronic component also.
   - Trend creatinine. Resolving.
   - Continue fluids of D51/2 NS @ 100 cc/hr.
   - Obtain OSH labs for baseline Cr.
   # Anemia: Likely secondary to AML. Resolved
   - Trend CBC, transfuse for hct<25.
   - Guaiac stools.
   # CHF/CV: Patient with BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 8924**] and CXR with cephalization
   suggestive of heart failure.  He is currently asymptomatic without
   dyspnea, orthopnea, chest pain, or PND. The patient also has an
   elevated TnT with flat CK in the setting of acute renal failure, likely
   representing demand ischemia.  One possible etiology is AS and sludging
   from leukostasis leading to demand ischemia and failure.  Another
   possible etiology is sludging leading to pulmonary emboli causing right
   heart failure and atrial fibrillation with CXR without significant
   pulmonary edema. ECG showing ST elevations in V1-V3.
   - Rasburicase, IVF, leukopheresis as above.
   - Lasix if patient develops volume overload
   - Continue metoprolol.
   - D/C
ed ASA because low platelets.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Not currently anticoagulated.
   - Continue metoprolol with goal HR 80-100.
   - Hold anticoagulation for now.
   .
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   .
   # HTN: Hold lisinopril given ARF. Continue metoprolol as above.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold statin.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Regular diet. Nutrition consult ordered for poor PO intake.

   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 8877**] is a 77 year old gentleman with a PMH
   significant for prostate CA on lupron therapy, GERD, and past afib s/p
   cardioversion admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for urgent plasmapheresis with a
   preliminary diagnosis of AML.
   .
   #AML with blasts, monocytic subtype on bone marrow: Patient s/p
   plasmaphoresis, s/p chemo therapy with hydroxyurea. Hyperviscosity was
   likely complicating both cardiac and renal function. WBC trending
   towards normal levels s/p 4 treatment with hydroxyurea. AML
   complications included tumor lysis and DIC and end organ dysfunction
   with resolved cardiac demand ischemia and ARF.
   --f/u oncology notes. Oncology will hold on hydroxyurea today.
    --Obtain records about baseline CBC/chemistries from OSH
   .
   #UTI/fever: Patient had a fever while getting FFP transfusion. Patient
   has Group B streptococcus in urine culture. Patient is essentially
   neutropenic, so will treat for prophylaxis also.
   --Continue cefepime (started [**8-14**]) and vanco (started [**8-14**]) for
   prophylaxis.
   --f/u blood culture
   --f/u CXR results in AM
   #DIC: Patient currently has no signs of bleeding. Resolved DIC. Has
   increased PT/PTT, increased LDH, High FDPs and high D dimer.
   --check DIC labs [**Hospital1 7**]
   --goal for fibrinogen >100, INR<1.5, platelets >10. Give
   crypo/platelets as needed.
   .
   #Tumor lysis: complicated by ARF. Problem resolved.
   --tumor lysis labs [**Hospital1 7**].
   -- UOP of >100cc/hr, so will continue fluids at D51/2 NS @ 100 cc/hr.
   --Given dose of Rasburicase 6 mg x1
   --Continue allopurinol.
    # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline. Possible etiologies include
   ARF from tumor lysis syndrome, DIC, or hypovolemia/poor cardiac output
   (less likely). FeNa=2.9%, FeUrea=33%, so likely not pre-renal.  Likely
   a chronic component also.
   - Trend creatinine. Resolving.
   - Continue fluids of D51/2 NS @ 100 cc/hr.
   - Obtain OSH labs for baseline Cr.
   # Anemia: Likely secondary to AML. Resolved
   - Trend CBC, transfuse for hct<25.
   - Guaiac stools.
   # CHF/CV: Patient with BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 8924**] and CXR with cephalization
   suggestive of heart failure.  He is currently asymptomatic without
   dyspnea, orthopnea, chest pain, or PND. The patient also has an
   elevated TnT with flat CK in the setting of acute renal failure, likely
   representing demand ischemia.  One possible etiology is AS and sludging
   from leukostasis leading to demand ischemia and failure.  Another
   possible etiology is sludging leading to pulmonary emboli causing right
   heart failure and atrial fibrillation with CXR without significant
   pulmonary edema. ECG showing ST elevations in V1-V3.
   - Rasburicase, IVF, leukopheresis as above.
   - Lasix if patient develops volume overload
   - Continue metoprolol.
   - D/C
ed ASA because low platelets.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Not currently anticoagulated.
   - Continue metoprolol with goal HR 80-100.
   - Hold anticoagulation for now.
   .
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   .
   # HTN: Hold lisinopril given ARF. Continue metoprolol as above.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Hold statin.

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:  77 yo M with prostate ca, gerd, remote a-fib
   post cardioversion presented with AML blast crisis c/b ARF (cr 2.8),
   elevated BNP, demand ischemia, atrial fib in setting of hyperviscosity,
   and DIC. He remains on antbx for functional neutropenia with recent
   fever.  He required no additional product/blood transfusions yesterday
   and has no signs of active bleeding.
   Exam: 100.6-->99.6   80-90 (fib)  MAP 60-80  20   98% 2L
   Alert m, nad, decreased oozing from phoresis cath site, scant rales,
   systolic m at L sternal border, RR, obese abd, NT soft, no edema,

   Urine cx: group b strep
   Agree with plan to continue allopurinol, following electrolytes.  His
   acute tumor lysis has resolved.  Will switch his IVF to maintenance,
   given poor po intake, monitoring his u/o closely. His counts are
   dropping post hydrea.  Additional chemo regimen per onc team.. He has
   functional neutropenia and in setting of recent fever will continue
   neutropenic coverage with vanco/cefepime day 2, following remaining cx
   data.  Vanco adequately covers his pos urine for group b strep. Will
   check repeat cxr as well given c/o cough, though he remains stable from
   respiratory standpoint on 2L NC.  His DIC has resolved and he shows no
   signs of active bleeding.  We continue to follow [**Hospital1 7**] DIC labs.  Will
   maintain plts > 10.  ARF is most likely from tumor lysis vs
   microvascular thrombosis from DIC vs atn.  We do not know his baseline
   fx.  We continue to renally dose meds.  His phos is trending down and
   he is maintaining good urine outpt.  Will assess OSH records for
   baseline labs.
   ICU: boots, PPI, Phoresis cath, PIVs, nutrition consider picc line
   placement.
   Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note.
   Pt is stable for transfer to BMT service.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, GERD, and atrial fibrillation who was admitted to the ICU for urgent plasmapheresis with a preliminary diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He has been treated with hydroxyurea, and his WBC count is trending towards normal levels. However, he has developed several complications, including:

1. Electrolyte and fluid disorder: The patient has a significant electrolyte imbalance, with hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has ongoing atrial fibrillation, which is not currently anticoagulated.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has a prolonged PT and PTT, indicating a coagulopathy.
4. Leukemia: The patient has AML, which is in blast crisis.
5. Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient has developed tumor lysis syndrome, which has resolved.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely caused by tumor lysis syndrome or hypovolemia/poor cardiac output.
7. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which is likely secondary to AML.
8. CHF/CV: The patient has signs of heart failure, including an elevated BNP and CXR with cephalization.
9. DIC: The patient has had a history of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which has resolved.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's assessment and plan include:

1. Continue anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.
2. Continue hydroxyurea for AML.
3. Monitor electrolyte levels and adjust as necessary.
4. Continue fluids at 100 cc/hr to maintain urine output.
5. Monitor creatinine levels and adjust as necessary.
6. Continue to trend CBC and transfuse as necessary.
7. Continue to monitor for signs of bleeding and adjust anticoagulation as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor for signs of heart failure and adjust as necessary.
9. Consider placing a picc line for future chemotherapy.
10. Continue to monitor for signs of infection and adjust as necessary.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Bleeding: The patient's coagulopathy and ongoing anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation increase the risk of bleeding.
2. Heart failure: The patient's signs of heart failure, including an elevated BNP and CXR with cephalization, increase the risk of worsening heart failure.
3. Infection: The patient's neutropenia and ongoing chemotherapy increase the risk of infection.
4. Renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure and ongoing chemotherapy increase the risk of worsening renal failure.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's ongoing atrial fibrillation and history of DIC increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias."

   Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 8877**] is a 77 year old gentleman with a PMH
   significant for prostate CA on lupron therapy, GERD, and past afib s/p
   cardioversion admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for urgent plasmapheresis with a
   preliminary diagnosis of AML.
   .
   #AML with blasts, monocytic subtype on bone marrow: Patient s/p
   plasmaphoresis, s/p chemo therapy with hydroxyurea. Hyperviscosity was
   likely complicating both cardiac and renal function. WBC trending
   towards normal levels s/p 4 treatment with hydroxyurea. AML
   complications including tumor lysis and DIC and end organ dysfunction
   with resolved cardiac demand ischemia and ARF.
   --f/u oncology notes. Oncology will hold on hydroxyurea today.
   --Continue to monitor patient for any symptoms relating to
   hyperviscosity syndrome.
    --Obtain records about baseline CBC/chemistries from OSH

   #Fever: Patient had a fever while getting FFP transfusion. Also
   complains of a sore throat today.
   --f/u cultures
   --Will start cefepime (started [**8-14**]) and vanco (started [**8-14**]) for
   prophylaxis.
   #DIC: Patient currently has no signs of bleeding. Has increased PT/PTT,
   increased LDH, High FDPs and high D dimer.
   --check DIC labs every 6 hrs
   --goal for fibrinogen >100, INR>1.5, platelets >20. Give
   crypo/platelets as needed.
   .
   #Tumor lysis: complicated by ARF.
   --tumor lysis labs q6 hr
   --150 meq sodium Bicarb at 150 cc/hr with a goal UOP of >100cc/hr. Use
   furosemide sparingly to diurese.
   --Given dose of Rasburicase 6 mg x1
    # Acute renal failure: Unknown baseline. Possible etiologies include
   ARF from tumor lysis syndrome, DIC, or hypovolemia/poor cardiac output
   (less likely). FeNa=2.9%, FeUrea=33%, so likely not pre-renal.
   - Trend creatinine
   - D5 with 3 amps of Bicarb at 100.
   - Onc recommends renal consult if thinking about dialysis.
   # Anemia: Likely secondary to AML.
   - Trend CBC, transfuse for hct<25.
   - Transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs today.
   - Guaiac stools.
   # CHF/CV: Patient with BNP of [**Numeric Identifier 8924**] and CXR with cephalization
   suggestive of heart failure.  He is currently asymptomatic without
   dyspnea, orthopnea, chest pain, or PND. The patient also has an
   elevated TnT with flat CK in the setting of acute renal failure, likely
   representing demand ischemia.  One possible etiology is AS and sludging
   from leukostasis leading to demand ischemia and failure.  Another
   possible etiology is sludging leading to pulmonary emboli causing right
   heart failure and atrial fibrillation with CXR without significant
   pulmonary edema. ECG showing ST elevations in V1-V3.
   - Rasburicase, IVF, leukopheresis as above.
   - Lasix if patient develops volume overload
   - Continue metoprolol.
   - Will D/C ASA.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Not currently anticoagulated.
   - Continue metoprolol with goal HR 80-100.
   - Hold anticoagulation for now.

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of prostate cancer, GERD, and atrial fibrillation, admitted to the ICU for urgent plasmapheresis with a preliminary diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He has undergone plasmaphoresis and chemotherapy with hydroxyurea, and is currently being treated for hyperviscosity syndrome, tumor lysis syndrome, and acute renal failure. He has also developed atrial fibrillation and is being monitored for signs of bleeding due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 114/61 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 25 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 98% on nasal cannula. His physical examination is notable for a harsh systolic murmur and irregular heart rhythm.

Laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count (WBC): 65.2 K/uL
* Hemoglobin (Hb): 8.9 g/dL
* Platelet count (Plt): 107 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 2.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.18 ng/mL
* D-dimer: 8897 ng/mL
* Fibrinogen: 428 mg/dL
* LDH: 118 IU/L

Potential medical complications:

1. Bleeding due to DIC: The patient's increased PT/PTT, LDH, and D-dimer levels suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation. Close monitoring for signs of bleeding is necessary.
2. Tumor lysis syndrome: The patient's elevated LDH and potassium levels suggest tumor lysis syndrome. Monitoring for signs of kidney failure and electrolyte imbalance is necessary.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output suggest acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels is necessary.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's irregular heart rhythm and elevated troponin-T level suggest atrial fibrillation. Monitoring for signs of cardiac ischemia and failure is necessary.
5. Leukostasis: The patient's elevated WBC count and platelet count suggest leukostasis. Monitoring for signs of pulmonary emboli and right heart failure is necessary.
6. Hyperviscosity syndrome: The patient's elevated WBC count and platelet count suggest hyperviscosity syndrome. Monitoring for signs of cardiac and renal dysfunction is necessary.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results closely.
2. Continue to treat the patient's hyperviscosity syndrome, tumor lysis syndrome, and acute renal failure with hydroxyurea, rasburicase, and diuretics as necessary.
3. Monitor the patient's bleeding risk and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac function and adjust therapy as necessary.
5. Consider consulting a nephrologist for further management of the patient's acute renal failure.
6. Consider consulting a cardiologist for further management of the patient's atrial fibrillation."
