 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   61 year old female with COPD on 3L home O2 s/p recent admission [**12-2**]
   for COPD exacerbation and newly diganosed LUL mass now admitted with
   respiratory distress...
   .
   #. Acute hypercarbic respiratory distress/Cough:  Etiology likely
   secondary to COPD exacerbation, although pt has LUL mass and bouts of
   coughing; concern for ? trachobroncheomalacia vs viral infection. No
   sign of bacterial infection but given mass a post-obstructive pneumonia
   could also  be a possibility.  There is no evidence of a new
   conslidation on CXR nor any effusions and pt is afebrile, no WBC; there
   is no pulmonary vascular congestion seen on CXR and BNP 89.  Pt did
   respond well to ativan and possible that anxiety is contributing in
   addition to her underlying disease.
   - continue albuterol q2 prn and ipratropium q6 nebs
   - continue solumedrol, FS QID while on high dose steroids
   - Continue azithromycin 500mg qday (day#1 is [**1-25**])
   - Sputum cultures, blood cultures ordered
   - CT chest w/ and w/o contrast in AM
   - continue supplemental O2 for goal SaO2 88-93%; PaO2 >60; will have
   low threshold to resume non-invasive ventilation for now, consider
   intubation if hypercarbia worsens, increased fatigue, or unable to
   protect airway
   - continue home lasix 80mg daily
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   - Tessalon pearls and ativan prn cough

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   61 year old female with COPD on 3L home O2 s/p recent admission [**12-2**]
   for COPD exacerbation and newly diganosed LUL mass now admitted with
   respiratory distress...
   .
   #. Acute hypercarbic respiratory distress/Cough:  Etiology likely
   secondary to COPD exacerbation, although pt has LUL mass and bouts of
   coughing; concern for ? trachobroncheomalacia vs viral infection. No
   sign of bacterial infection but given mass a post-obstructive pneumonia
   could also  be a possibility.  There is no evidence of a new
   conslidation on CXR nor any effusions and pt is afebrile, no WBC; there
   is no pulmonary vascular congestion seen on CXR and BNP 89.   Pt with
   continued cough and shallow breathes with SOB.
   - continue albuterol q2 and q1:prn and ipratropium q6 nebs
   - continue solumedrol, FS QID while on high dose steroids
   - Continue azithromycin 500mg qday (day#2 is [**1-25**])
   - Sputum cultures, blood cultures ordered
   - CT chest w/ and w/o contrast ordered, but will hold off given
   respiratory status
   - continue supplemental O2 for goal SaO2 88-93%; PaO2 >60;  We will try
   another trial of BiPAP as tolerated. Will have low threshold to resume
   non-invasive ventilation for now, consider intubation if hypercarbia
   worsens, increased fatigue, or unable to protect airway
   - continue home lasix 80mg daily
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   - cough suppressants and morphine/ativan prn cough
   #. Fibromyalgia:
   -continue home fentanyl patch, SOMA, darvocet, gabapentin, amitryptline
   and Propoxyphene per home regimen
   -Holding home valium for now; giving ativan prn given pt slightly
   sedated after 2mg Ativan given in ED; prefer to monitor closely

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's current health status as follows:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with COPD, recently admitted for an exacerbation and newly diagnosed LUL mass, now presenting with respiratory distress. She is experiencing acute hypercarbic respiratory distress, cough, and shortness of breath. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 93/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She has a history of fibromyalgia and is being treated with various medications.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 7.8 K/uL
* Hematocrit: 31.1%
* Platelet count: 191 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 36 mg/dL
* Glucose: 220 mg/dL
* Calcium: 8.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.4 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 3.2 mg/dL

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Respiratory support: albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers, supplemental oxygen, and possible BiPAP or non-invasive ventilation
* Antibiotics: azithromycin
* Steroids: solumedrol
* Pain management: cough suppressants, morphine, and ativan
* Prophylaxis: subcutaneous heparin, colace/senna, and home PPI
* Nutrition: regular diet
* Glycemic control: monitoring blood glucose levels

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure: worsening hypercarbic respiratory distress, increased fatigue, or inability to protect the airway
* Infection: development of pneumonia or other infections due to the LUL mass or COPD exacerbation
* Bleeding: risk of bleeding due to platelet count of 191 K/uL
* Renal impairment: worsening creatinine levels
* Hypoglycemia: risk of hypoglycemia due to high blood glucose levels
* Other complications: potential complications related to fibromyalgia, such as pain or fatigue."

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical history, currently admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, acidosis, and hypotension. The patient has a history of severe COPD, fibromyalgia, and possible viral or atypical infection. They are receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, steroids, and bronchodilators. The patient required intubation for increased work of breathing and is currently on BiPAP.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD and possible viral or atypical infection increase the risk of respiratory failure. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to manage their respiratory status.
2. Acidosis/Hypotension: The patient's decreased pH and hypotension may indicate a metabolic acidosis, which can worsen respiratory and cardiovascular function. Bolus fluids and close monitoring are necessary to manage this condition.
3. Infection: The patient's possible viral or atypical infection may progress to a more severe condition, such as pneumonia or sepsis, if not managed promptly.
4. Fibromyalgia: The patient's fibromyalgia may exacerbate their respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms, requiring close monitoring and management.
5. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD): The patient's GERD may worsen their respiratory symptoms and increase the risk of aspiration.
6. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety may exacerbate their respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms, requiring close monitoring and management.
7. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient's immobility and medical condition increase the risk of VTE, requiring prophylactic measures such as compression stockings and SQ UF Heparin.
8. Stress Ulcer: The patient's critical illness may increase the risk of stress ulcer, requiring prophylactic measures such as PPI.
9. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of VAP, requiring close monitoring and management."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with severe COPD, possibly contributed to by malignancy, viral process, or atypical infection. They have experienced respiratory failure, acidosis, and hypotension. The patient's condition is being managed with medications such as Solumedrol, atrovent, albuterol, and azithromycin. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen and bipap, and is being monitored closely for gas exchange. The patient is also experiencing anxiety, which is being treated with gentle benzodiazepines. The patient's acidosis is being managed with slow bolus fluids, and lactate levels are being sent. The patient's fibromyalgia is being managed with outpatient medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD and respiratory failure put them at risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory arrest.
2. Acidosis: The patient's acidosis, which is being managed with slow bolus fluids and lactate levels, puts them at risk for further acidosis and related complications, such as arrhythmias, seizures, and cardiac arrest.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension, which is being managed with fluids and medication, puts them at risk for further hypotension and related complications, such as organ failure, shock, and cardiac arrest.
4. Infection: The patient's atypical infection or post-obstructive pneumonia puts them at risk for further infection and related complications, such as sepsis, organ failure, and death.
5. Malignancy: The patient's possible contribution of malignancy to their respiratory failure puts them at risk for further complications related to cancer, such as metastasis, organ failure, and death.
6. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety, which is being treated with gentle benzodiazepines, puts them at risk for further anxiety-related complications, such as panic attacks, agitation, and self-harm.
7. Fibromyalgia: The patient's fibromyalgia, which is being managed with outpatient medications, puts them at risk for further complications related to chronic pain, such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of COPD and newly diagnosed LUL mass, admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress. She was intubated due to hypoxia, hypercarbia, and rapid shallow breathing. The patient is receiving high-dose steroids and antibiotics. Her current vital signs are:

* Tmax: 37.8°C (100.1°F)
* Tcurrent: 35.9°C (96.6°F)
* HR: 58 bpm (55-107 bpm)
* BP: 112/51 mmHg (73-122 mmHg)
* RR: 16 inspirations per minute (12-24 inspirations per minute)
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Alert and oriented, but coughing with some respiratory distress
* Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops
* Soft, non-tender, non-distended abdomen with present bowel sounds
* Foley catheter in place
* Warm, well-perfused extremities with 2+ pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema

Lab results show:

* WBC: 7.8 K/uL
* Hct: 31.1%
* Plt: 191 K/uL
* Cr: 0.7 mg/dL
* TCO2: 36 mmHg
* Glucose: 220 mg/dL
* Lactic Acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Ca++: 8.6 mg/dL
* Mg++: 2.5 mg/dL
* PO4: 2.9 mg/dL

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's acute hypercarbic respiratory distress and COPD exacerbation increase the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of a LUL mass and cough may indicate a post-obstructive pneumonia, which could worsen the patient's respiratory status.
3. Infection: The patient's neutrophil count is rising, and she is receiving antibiotics, which may indicate a potential infection.
4. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of high-dose steroids and antibiotics may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Thrombosis: The patient's use of heparin for DVT prophylaxis may increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Sepsis: The patient's rising temperature and WBC count may indicate a potential septic episode.
7. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiac complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac failure.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: The patient's NPO status and use of high-dose steroids may increase the risk of nutritional deficiencies."

   cough
   61 year old female with COPD on 3L home O2 s/p recent admission [**12-2**]
   for COPD exacerbation and newly diganosed LUL mass now admitted with
   respiratory distress...
   .
   #. Acute hypercarbic respiratory distress/Cough:  Etiology likely
   secondary to COPD exacerbation, although pt has LUL mass and bouts of
   coughing; concern for ? trachobroncheomalacia vs viral infection. No
   sign of bacterial infection but given mass a post-obstructive pneumonia
   could also  be a possibility.  There is no evidence of a new
   conslidation on CXR nor any effusions and pt is afebrile, no WBC; there
   is no pulmonary vascular congestion seen on CXR and BNP 89.   Pt with
   continued cough and shallow breathes with SOB.
   - continue albuterol q2 and q1:prn and ipratropium q6 nebs
   - continue solumedrol, FS QID while on high dose steroids
   - Continue azithromycin 500mg qday (day#2 is [**1-25**])
   - Sputum cultures, blood cultures ordered
   - CT chest w/ and w/o contrast ordered, but will hold off given
   respiratory status
   - continue supplemental O2 for goal SaO2 88-93%; PaO2 >60;  We will try
   another trial of BiPAP as tolerated. Will have low threshold to resume
   non-invasive ventilation for now, consider intubation if hypercarbia
   worsens, increased fatigue, or unable to protect airway
   - continue home lasix 80mg daily
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   - cough suppressants and morphine/ativan prn cough
   #. Fibromyalgia:
   -continue home fentanyl patch, SOMA, darvocet, gabapentin, amitryptline
   and Propoxyphene per home regimen

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of COPD and a newly diagnosed lung mass, admitted to the ICU for acute hypercarbic respiratory distress. She is intubated and on invasive ventilation, with high sedation requirements. Her respiratory status is stable, but her lung function is poor, with wheezing and rhonchi in the left upper lobe. She has a fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Her laboratory results show mild anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and normal electrolyte levels. She is on various medications, including antibiotics, steroids, and pain management medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is already compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration if not managed properly.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of a lung mass and cough suggests the possibility of pneumonia, which could worsen her respiratory status.
3. Tracheobronchomalacia: The patient's cough and respiratory distress may be related to tracheobronchomalacia, a condition characterized by weakness or collapse of the trachea and bronchi.
4. Post-obstructive pneumonia: The patient's lung mass could be causing post-obstructive pneumonia, which could lead to further respiratory complications.
5. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and hypertension may indicate cardiac stress, which could lead to cardiac complications if not managed properly.
6. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and mild anemia may indicate infection, which could worsen her respiratory status and overall health.
7. Medication-related complications: The patient is on various medications, including antibiotics, steroids, and pain management medications, which could interact with each other or cause side effects that compromise her respiratory status or overall health.

Recommendations:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status closely and adjust her ventilator settings and medications as needed.
2. Consider repeating the CT chest with and without contrast to further evaluate the lung mass and rule out pneumonia.
3. Continue to manage the patient's pain and discomfort with pain management medications, while avoiding over-sedation.
4. Consider weaning the patient off the ventilator and switching to non-invasive ventilation if her respiratory status improves.
5. Monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust her medications as needed to prevent electrolyte imbalances.
6. Consider ordering blood cultures to rule out infection and monitor the patient's white blood cell count to detect any signs of infection.
7. Continue to communicate with the patient and her family to ensure that they are aware of her condition and any changes in her status."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with severe COPD who was admitted for COPD exacerbation and respiratory distress. She was intubated on day 1 for worsening respiratory distress despite BiPAP therapy. 

The patient's current vital signs are: temperature 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate 56 bpm, blood pressure 110/52 mmHg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 56 bpm. 

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.0 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 7.8 K/uL
* Platelet count: 191 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 30 mEq/L
* Sodium: 139 mEq/L
* Potassium: 4.0 mEq/L
* Chloride: 102 mEq/L
* Carbon dioxide: 29.4%
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.5 mg/dL
* Phosphate: 2.9 mg/dL

The patient's imaging studies show a preliminary abnormality in the left upper lobe of the lung, with emphysematous change and diffuse lower lobe peripheral tree. 

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure due to underlying severe COPD, with a possible viral or atypical bacterial infection
* Weaning of FiO2 today, with consideration of pressure support ventilation (PSV) or spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) as tolerated
* Continuation of Solu-Medrol, scheduled nebulizations, and azithromycin
* Follow-up viral culture
* Obtaining sputum culture today
* Resuming home furosemide

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to worsening COPD
* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections
* Sepsis or septic shock
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Stress ulcer bleeding
* Furosemide-induced electrolyte imbalances
* Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy
* Nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity due to azithromycin or other medications

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies to detect any potential complications and adjust treatment accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted for exacerbation with respiratory distress and coughing spasms. She was intubated due to worsening respiratory distress and refractory hypoxemia despite non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 56 beats per minute, blood pressure of 110/52 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is also receiving various medications, including propofol, fentanyl, lorazepam, pantoprazole, and heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying severe COPD and the possibility of a viral or atypical bacterial infection could lead to further respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's intubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation make her susceptible to VAP.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's CT scan shows a preliminary abnormality in the left upper lobe, which could be indicative of pneumonia.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lactate level suggest the possibility of sepsis, which could be caused by a variety of factors, including pneumonia or other infections.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant medications and her history of COPD increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's history of COPD and her prolonged immobility make her susceptible to pulmonary embolism.
7. Worsening Respiratory Distress: The patient's underlying COPD and the possibility of a viral or atypical bacterial infection could lead to further worsening of her respiratory distress.
8. Cardiac Arrest: The patient's underlying cardiac disease and the possibility of sepsis or other complications could lead to cardiac arrest."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

* Heart rate: 50 beats per minute
* Blood pressure: 146/59 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Hemodynamic monitoring: Sinus bradycardia
* Fluid balance: +740 mL of fluid input and -2,030 mL of fluid output, resulting in a net negative fluid balance of -2,030 mL

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 16.0 x 10^9/L
* Hemoglobin: 10.1 g/dL
* Platelet count: 199 x 10^9/L
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 221 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 0.7 mmol/L
* Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.5 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's respiratory support includes a nasogastric tube, endotracheal tube, and mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Sepsis or septic shock
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* Prolonged mechanical ventilation and weaning difficulties
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to prolonged nasogastric tube use
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to insulin resistance and glucose control issues
* Electrolyte imbalances, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia
* Renal insufficiency or acute kidney injury due to fluid overload and sepsis
* Cardiovascular complications, such as hypotension, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest."

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress due to COPD exacerbation and a newly diagnosed left upper lobe (LUL) mass. She was intubated on January 26th due to inability to tolerate bipap and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 50 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 146/59 mmHg. Her respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 96% on a FiO2 of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 16.0, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 199 K/uL. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 24 mg/dL, and her creatinine is 0.6 mg/dL. Her lactate level is 0.7 mmol/L, and her calcium level is 8.6 mg/dL.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. She is also receiving albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers every 2 and 6 hours, respectively.

The patient's plan includes continued mechanical ventilation, with a goal of weaning down the FiO2 and trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) today. She will also have a repeat chest X-ray (CXR) in the morning and a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) test later today. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: Given the patient's COPD exacerbation and LUL mass, there is a risk of developing pneumonia, which could worsen her respiratory status.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged use of mechanical ventilation increases her risk of developing VAP, which could lead to sepsis and organ failure.
3. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's immobility and respiratory distress increase her risk of developing a pulmonary embolism, which could lead to respiratory failure and death.
4. Sepsis: The patient's respiratory distress and immunosuppression increase her risk of developing sepsis, which could lead to organ failure and death.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and respiratory distress increase her risk of developing respiratory failure, which could lead to death.
6. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's respiratory distress and immobility increase her risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias and myocardial infarction.
7. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's respiratory distress and immobility increase her risk of developing gastrointestinal complications, such as aspiration and gastrointestinal bleeding.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment plan accordingly to prevent these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old female with COPD on 3L home O2 s/p recent admission [**12-2**]
   for COPD exacerbation and newly diganosed LUL mass now admitted with
   respiratory distress...
   .
   #. Acute hypercarbic respiratory distress/Cough:  Etiology likely
   secondary to COPD exacerbation, although pt has LUL mass and bouts of
   coughing;  No sign of bacterial infection but given mass a
   post-obstructive pneumoni- could also be viral although initial viral
   swab neg.  There is no evidence of a new conslidation on CXR nor any
   effusions and pt is afebrile, no WBC (rising now on steroids); there is
   no pulmonary vascular congestion seen on CXR and BNP 89.   Pt had
   continued cough and shallow breathing with fatigue and unable to
   tolerate BIPAP; thus intubated on [**1-26**] but now doing very well.
   Unclear if anxiety playing a large role in addition to her known
   underlying disease.
   - continue albuterol q2 and q1:prn and ipratropium q6 nebs
   - continue solumedrol, FS QID while on high dose steroids; begin wean
   - Goal to extubated today given doing well on PSV
   - Continue azithromycin 500mg qday (day#3)
   - f/u culture data
   - continue home lasix 80mg daily
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   - Low threshold to reintubate
   #. Fibromyalgia:
   -continue home fentanyl patch, SOMA, darvocet, gabapentin, amitryptline
   and Propoxyphene per home regimen
   -Holding home valium for now; giving ativan prn given pt slightly
   sedated after 2mg Ativan given in ED; prefer to monitor closely
   .
   #Anxiety
   -Start  Valium 5mg IV TID per home regimen
   -Ativan prn
   # Anemia: At baseline 31.4.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female admitted to the ICU for acute hypercarbic respiratory distress and newly diagnosed lung mass. She was previously diagnosed with COPD and has a history of fibromyalgia. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 50 bpm, and blood pressure of 146/59 mmHg. Her oxygen saturation is 96% on 40% FiO2. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 16.0, hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 199. Her creatinine level is 0.6 mg/dL, and her glucose level is 221 mg/dL. 

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 500 mL. Her peak inspiratory pressure is 26 cmH2O, and her plateau pressure is 16 cmH2O. 

The patient's assessment is that she has acute hypercarbic respiratory distress secondary to COPD exacerbation, and possibly a post-obstructive pneumonia. She is also being treated for fibromyalgia and anxiety. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation and possible post-obstructive pneumonia.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of cough and shallow breathing suggest the possibility of pneumonia, which can lead to further complications.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 10.1 g/dL, which is lower than normal. Anemia can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.

4. Infection: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which may indicate an underlying infection. 

5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk of developing a pulmonary embolism due to her COPD and immobility.

6. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulant therapy and her COPD may increase her risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

7. Anxiety and agitation: The patient's anxiety and agitation may lead to increased heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate, which can further complicate her condition.

8. Sedation and medication-related complications: The patient is receiving multiple medications, including sedatives and analgesics, which can lead to sedation, respiratory depression, and other complications.

9. Inadequate oxygenation: The patient's oxygen saturation is 96%, which is lower than normal. Inadequate oxygenation can lead to tissue hypoxia and further complications.

10. Increased risk of ventilator-associated complications: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases her risk of developing ventilator-associated complications, such as pneumonia and respiratory failure."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with severe COPD who was admitted for COPD exacerbation and respiratory distress. She was intubated on January 27th due to worsening respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 126/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.1 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 16.0 K/uL
* Platelet count: 199 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.6 mg/dL
* Glucose: 221 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: within normal range

The patient's imaging studies show:

* Chest X-ray: perihilar fullness and left effusion

The patient's microbiology results are negative for sputum, urine, and blood cultures.

The patient's assessment and plan include:

* Respiratory failure due to severe COPD, with a plan to extubate today and transition to BiPAP.
* Controlling pain with scheduled nebs and increasing patch as we wean off IV fentanyl.
* Managing leukocytosis likely due to steroids.
* ICU care includes glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, lines management, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP, and communication with the patient's family.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to worsening COPD or reintubation
* Pneumonia or other respiratory infections
* Sepsis or septic shock
* Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
* Neurological complications due to prolonged mechanical ventilation
* Cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias or cardiac arrest
* Infection or sepsis due to central lines or other invasive devices
* Metabolic complications such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia
* Nutritional deficiencies due to prolonged fasting or malnutrition."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with severe COPD who was admitted for COPD exacerbation and respiratory distress. She was intubated on January 27th for worsened respiratory distress. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pain medications, and respiratory treatments. She has been stable, but there are concerns about respiratory failure and fibromyalgia.

Potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying severe COPD and recent intubation increase her risk for respiratory failure. There is a possibility of reintubation if extubation is attempted.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's recent intubation and respiratory distress increase her risk for pneumonia.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for VAP due to her prolonged intubation and respiratory support.
4. Sepsis: The patient's recent antibiotics and respiratory treatments increase her risk for sepsis.
5. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's COPD and respiratory distress may increase her risk for cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure.
6. Neurological complications: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation may increase her risk for neurological complications, such as seizures or brain damage.
7. Infection: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation increase her risk for infection, particularly pneumonia or sepsis.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation may increase her risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
9. Kidney damage: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation may increase her risk for kidney damage or acute kidney injury.
10. Worsening of COPD: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation may worsen her underlying COPD, increasing her risk for future respiratory exacerbations.

Overall, the patient is at risk for various medical complications due to her underlying COPD, respiratory distress, and intubation. Close monitoring and management of her condition are necessary to prevent or minimize these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of COPD, who was admitted for a COPD exacerbation and was diagnosed with a left upper lobe mass. She was intubated and required invasive ventilation, but was extubated and switched to non-invasive ventilation (CPAP) with a sputum Gram stain showing Gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.2°C (97.1°F)
* Heart rate: 62 bpm (53-88 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 126/57 mmHg (84-135/50-97 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 10 breaths per minute (8-20 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 97%
* SpO2: 97%

The patient's laboratory results show:

* White blood cell count: 16.0 K/uL (9.2-8.3 K/uL)
* Hemoglobin: 11.1 g/dL (29.4-29.7-33.7%)
* Platelet count: 229 K/uL (199-212 K/uL)
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL (0.4-0.6 mg/dL)
* Blood urea nitrogen: 37 mg/dL (35-36-33-37 mg/dL)
* Glucose: 221 mg/dL (139-131-36 mg/dL)

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 97%. However, she has a cough and is experiencing shallow breathing with shortness of breath.

The patient's medical plan includes:

* Continue albuterol and ipratropium nebs
* Continue solumedrol and taper down over the next day
* Repeat CXR in the morning
* Continue azithromycin and monitor culture data
* Continue home lasix and repeat CXR in the morning
* Repeat RSBI and titrate down FiO2 and trial of PSV and possible SBT

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Pneumonia: Given the patient's history of COPD and the presence of a left upper lobe mass, there is a risk of developing pneumonia.
* Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a risk of developing respiratory failure if her condition worsens.
* Cardiovascular complications: The patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, and there is a risk of developing cardiovascular complications if her condition worsens.
* Infection: The patient has a history of COPD and is at risk of developing infections, particularly pneumonia.
* Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is slightly low, and there is a risk of developing anemia if her condition worsens.

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but there are potential medical complications that can arise. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient, a 61-year-old female with COPD, was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and a newly diagnosed left upper lobe mass. She was intubated on January 26th and successfully extubated on January 28th. The patient was started on non-invasive ventilation (CPAP) and is currently on nasal cannula oxygen. The patient's sputum culture revealed gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains, indicating a possible post-obstructive pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 62 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 126/57 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is improved, with a respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute and a SpO2 of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show normal to mildly elevated levels of white blood cells, platelets, and creatinine. The patient's lactic acid level is 0.7 mmol/L, indicating a normal metabolic state.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture reveals gram-positive cocci, which may indicate a post-obstructive pneumonia. This could lead to further respiratory distress and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is still compromised, and she may require further respiratory support. Prolonged respiratory failure can lead to further complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and lung injury.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is 11.1 g/dL, indicating anemia. This could lead to further complications, such as fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. DVT: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to her immobility and respiratory status. This could lead to further complications, such as pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome.
5. Infection: The patient's sputum culture reveals gram-positive cocci, which may indicate a bacterial infection. This could lead to further complications, such as sepsis and organ failure.
6. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's respiratory status and anemia may lead to further cardiovascular complications, such as decreased cardiac output and increased risk of arrhythmias."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who was admitted for exacerbation and respiratory distress. She was intubated on day 1 for worsening respiratory distress and was extubated on day 2. She is currently receiving oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 118/57 mmHg. She has a history of fibromyalgia and is being treated with pain medications. Her laboratory results show mild anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated creatinine levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying severe COPD and intubation may increase the risk of respiratory failure. Monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygenation is crucial.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture shows GPCs, which may indicate a bacterial infection. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and the patient should be monitored for signs of pneumonia.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation may increase the risk of VAP. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and daily chest X-rays are necessary to detect any signs of VAP.
4. Bloodstream infection: The patient's central line and peripheral IV lines may increase the risk of bloodstream infection. Regular monitoring of her blood cultures and antibiotic therapy is necessary.
5. Wound infection: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to her respiratory status and prolonged hospitalization. Close monitoring of her skin and wound care is necessary to detect any signs of infection.
6. Delirium: The patient's prolonged hospitalization and respiratory status may increase the risk of delirium. Close monitoring of her mental status and cognitive function is necessary.
7. Medication side effects: The patient's medication regimen may cause side effects, such as gastrointestinal upset, headache, or dizziness. Close monitoring of her medication side effects and adjustment of her medication regimen as necessary is crucial.
8. Discharge planning: The patient's discharge plan should be carefully planned to ensure a smooth transition to home care. The patient's home situation, medication regimen, and follow-up appointments should be addressed to prevent complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo woman w/ severe COPD on home O2 admitted initially for COPD exac
   and resp distress, intubated [**1-27**] for resp distress.
   (1) RESP FAILURE- underlying severe COPD; CT c/w viral process vs
   atypical bacterial infxn as well as nonspec LUL pattern
   -cont to wean O2
   -cont slow Solu-Medrol wean 60 mg q8h  --> taper today to prednisone 40
   qd
   -cont azithro --> ok to continue but f/u sputum GPCs in case change is
   made
   -resume home furosemide
   -resume home anxiety regimen
   (2) FIBROMYALGIA- stable; cont pain meds, will increase patch as we
   wean off IV fentanyl
   -resume Soma
   (3) DISPO-SW to aid w/ difficult home situation as well as difficulty
   affording important meds such as Spiriva and Advair

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with severe COPD who was admitted for COPD exacerbation and respiratory distress. She was intubated on January 27th due to worsening respiratory distress. She was extubated yesterday evening.

The patient's current vital signs are:

* Temperature: 37.3°C (99.2°F)
* Heart rate: 96 bpm (normal range: 55-96 bpm)
* Blood pressure: 118/57 mmHg (normal range: 78-150/76-146 mmHg)
* Respiratory rate: 14 breaths per minute (normal range: 8-19 breaths per minute)
* Oxygen saturation: 96%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* Well-nourished general appearance
* Clear breath sounds with diminished wheezes
* Right and left lower extremity edema (trace)
* No skin lesions or neurologic deficits

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 11.1 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 16.0 K/uL
* Platelet count: 229 K/uL
* Blood urea nitrogen: 27 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.7 mg/dL
* Electrolyte levels: within normal range
* Blood glucose: 221 mg/dL

The patient has a history of fibromyalgia, which is stable. She is also being treated for respiratory failure due to underlying severe COPD, and is being weaned off oxygen and steroids.

Potential medical complications that may arise include:

* Respiratory failure due to underlying severe COPD
* Pneumonia or other infections
* Pneumothorax or other lung complications
* Cardiovascular complications due to COPD exacerbation
* Nutritional deficiencies due to decreased oral intake
* Skin breakdown or pressure ulcers due to immobility
* Neurological complications due to fibromyalgia or other underlying conditions

The patient's plan includes:

* Continuing to wean off oxygen and steroids
* Resuming home medications, including furosemide and anxiety regimen
* Increasing patch for fibromyalgia pain
* Resuming Soma for fibromyalgia
* Disposition to floor with PT/OT for rehabilitation

Overall, the patient's condition is stable, but she requires close monitoring and management to prevent potential complications."
