You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with RUL wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on October 4th. She is currently in the ICU due to acute hypoxemia from rehabilitation, which revealed large saddle emboli and right ventricular (RV) strain.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Hemodynamics: Stable with SBP > 100 and HR in the low 100s, but with increased work of breathing (WOB).
* Oxygenation: Adequate O2 saturation on 6L, but with increased WOB.
* RV strain: Concerning on EKG and by CTA, and is very preload-dependent.
* Pulmonary Embolism: Currently being treated with heparin infusion to achieve a goal PTT of 60-100, and will be followed up with LENI and ECHO.

The patient has several medical conditions, including:

* Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): Significant underlying disease, likely contributing to overall pulmonary compromise.
* RV strain: Concerning on EKG and by CTA, and is very preload-dependent.
* Pulmonary Embolism: Currently being treated with heparin infusion.
* Hypercoaguable state: Possible due to immobility with recent surgery and rehabilitation, or hypercoaguable state from family history.
* Underlying cardiac disease: Severe underlying COPD, which will need to be maximized.

Potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

* Acute respiratory failure: Due to severe underlying COPD and pulmonary embolism.
* Cardiac compromise: Due to RV strain and underlying cardiac disease.
* Sepsis: Due to possible hypercoaguable state and recent surgery.
* Acute kidney injury: Due to dehydration and possible hypercoaguable state.
* Gastrointestinal complications: Due to recent surgery and possible hypercoaguable state.

The patient's plan of care includes:

* Heparin infusion to achieve a goal PTT of 60-100.
* Follow-up LENI and ECHO.
* Monitoring with telemetry and arterial line.
* Follow-up cardiac surgery and thoracic recommendations.
* Continue COPD treatment.
* Oxycodone for pain relief.
* Fluid resuscitation to address RV strain and possible dehydration.
* Re-evaluate in the morning and consider TPA and IVF if acute decompensation occurs.

The patient's husband, [**Name (NI) 98**], is the contact person and can be reached at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6112**]. The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU until further improvement."

Summary:

The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with RUL wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on [**2180-10-4**]. She was admitted to the ICU with acute hypoxemia from rehab, found to have large saddle emboli and RV strain. She is currently hemodynamically stable with SBP > 100 and HR in the low 100s, but with increased work of breathing. She has underlying COPD, and the etiology of the pulmonary embolism is unclear, possibly related to immobility or hypercoagulable state. She is receiving heparin and has an arterial line in place. Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery via aerosol-cool and she is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a large saddle emboli and RV strain, which can lead to further pulmonary compromise and potentially life-threatening complications such as hypoxia, cardiac arrest, and death.
2. RV Strain: The patient's RV strain is concerning and may lead to further hemodynamic instability and cardiac complications.
3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's underlying COPD can exacerbate with increased respiratory effort, leading to further respiratory compromise and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Hypercoagulable State: The patient's hypercoagulable state can lead to further thrombotic events, including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
5. Infection: The patient's recent N/V and possible D can lead to infection, including Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) colitis.
6. Hypoglycemia/Hyperglycemia: The patient's steroid taper and hyperglycemia can lead to hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, which can have serious consequences if not managed properly.
7. Pain Management: The patient's pain management with opioids can lead to respiratory depression and other complications if not managed properly.

Recommendations:

1. Continue heparin therapy to prevent further thrombotic events.
2. Monitor the patient's hemodynamics closely and adjust therapy as needed.
3. Continue respiratory support with oxygen delivery via aerosol-cool and monitor for signs of respiratory compromise.
4. Continue COPD treatment with Advair, tiotroprium, Albuterol PRN, and steroid taper.
5. Monitor for signs of infection, including fever, leukocytosis, and changes in vital signs.
6. Monitor glucose levels and adjust therapy as needed to prevent hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
7. Continue pain management with opioids and monitor for signs of respiratory depression.
8. Follow up with cardiac surgery and thoracic surgery recommendations.
9. Repeat ABG and echocardiogram as ordered.
10. Consider sending stool C. diff test if loose stools persist."

Summary:

The patient, a post-cardiovascular surgery patient, is being treated in the ICU for low urine output despite receiving 2.5 liters of fluids. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 100-112 bpm, and blood pressure of 120/79 mmHg. The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion and has an arterial line inserted. The patient's physical examination reveals tachycardia, well-healing incision, and no signs of respiratory distress. The patient's neurologic examination is non-focal, with equal movement of all limbs and coherent speech.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal failure: The patient's low urine output (200-105 mL in 24 hours) may indicate impending renal failure, which can be exacerbated by the patient's cardiovascular surgery and potential sepsis.
2. Sepsis: The patient's low urine output, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels (1.4 mmol/L) may indicate sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ failure if not promptly treated.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient's tachycardia and elevated troponin-T levels (0.05 ng/mL) may indicate cardiac complications, such as myocardial infarction or cardiac failure, which can worsen the patient's condition.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's tachypnea and shallow expansion may indicate impending respiratory failure, which can be exacerbated by the patient's cardiovascular surgery and potential sepsis.
5. Bleeding complications: The patient's low platelet count (35.6%) and elevated INR (1.5) may indicate bleeding complications, which can worsen the patient's condition.
6. Neurologic complications: The patient's non-focal neurologic examination may indicate impending neurologic complications, such as stroke or encephalopathy, which can worsen the patient's condition.

Recommendations:

1. Monitor the patient's urine output and fluid balance closely to prevent renal failure.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs and laboratory results to detect early signs of sepsis, cardiac complications, and bleeding complications.
3. Consider adjusting the patient's antibiotic regimen to address potential sepsis.
4. Consider consulting a cardiothoracic surgeon to assess the patient's cardiac status and potential complications.
5. Consider consulting a nephrologist to assess the patient's renal function and potential complications.
6. Monitor the patient's neurologic status closely to detect early signs of neurologic complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   Acute pulmonary emboli (""saddle"")
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to actue pulmonary embolism, on
   background of COPD and partial RUL resection.  Treat PE, continue COPD
   medications.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM, ACUTE -- ""saddle"" by CT angio;  therapeutic on iv
   Heparin.  Evidence for RV strain by echo in ER --> repeat formal study
   to assess RV function (may have underlying pulmonary hypertension
   related to COPD).
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to extensive pulmonary embolism.  Continue
   supplimentall oxygen --> maintain >90%.
   OLIGURIA -- prerenal; improved with iv fluids.  Monitor uo, BUN,
   creatinine.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemic;  receiving iv fluids, monitor I/O.
   s/p RUL RESECTION, partial (wedge) -- no further plans.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with a complex medical condition. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and has undergone a partial right upper lobe (RUL) resection. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with multiple comorbidities.

The patient's current condition is as follows:

* Respiratory: The patient has acute pulmonary embolism (PE) with ""saddle"" shape on CT angio, attributed to COPD and partial RUL resection. The patient is receiving therapeutic doses of iv Heparin.
* Cardiovascular: The patient has evidence of right ventricular (RV) strain by echo in the emergency room (ER), which may be related to pulmonary hypertension due to COPD.
* Renal: The patient has oliguria attributed to prerenal causes, which has improved with iv fluids.
* Fluid status: The patient is hypovolemic and is receiving iv fluids.

The patient is currently receiving the following treatments:

* Respiratory support: Supplemental oxygen to maintain >90% SpO2.
* Cardiovascular support: iv Heparin for therapeutic doses.
* Renal support: iv fluids to manage oliguria.
* Nutrition: The patient is receiving nutrition support, but the specific type and amount are not specified.
* Glycemic control: The patient's glucose level is 110 mg/dL, which is within the normal range.
* Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with systemic anticoagulation using Heparin, stress ulcer with PPI, and VAP with HOB elevation.

The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is ICU. The patient has spent a total of 55 minutes with the healthcare team.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

* Further pulmonary embolism or worsening of existing PE
* Right ventricular failure or cardiac arrest
* Renal failure or worsening of existing oliguria
* Hypoxemia or respiratory failure
* Infection or sepsis
* Bleeding or hemorrhage due to anticoagulation therapy
* Nutritional deficiencies or malnutrition due to inadequate nutrition support.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust treatment accordingly to prevent or manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Acute pulmonary emboli (""saddle"")
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- attributed to actue pulmonary embolism, on
   background of COPD and partial RUL resection.  Treat PE, continue COPD
   medications.
   PULMONARY EMBOLISM, ACUTE -- ""saddle"" by CT angio;  therapeutic on iv
   Heparin.  Evidence for RV strain by echo in ER --> repeat formal study
   to assess RV function (may have underlying pulmonary hypertension
   related to COPD).
   HYPOXEMIA -- attributed to extensive pulmonary embolism.  Continue
   supplimentall oxygen --> maintain >90%.
   OLIGURIA -- prerenal; improved with iv fluids.  Monitor uo, BUN,
   creatinine.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemic;  receiving iv fluids, monitor I/O.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Summary:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and partial right upper lobe (RUL) resection. The patient has developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) attributed to acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and is receiving therapeutic doses of heparin. The patient has also been diagnosed with hypoxemia, oliguria, and hypovolemia. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen and IV fluids to manage these conditions.

Potential medical complications:

1. Progression of ARDS: The patient's condition can worsen if the ARDS is not effectively managed, leading to further respiratory failure and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The patient's history of COPD and partial RUL resection increases the risk of pulmonary hypertension, which can further exacerbate respiratory distress.
3. Renal failure: The patient's oliguria and hypovolemia increase the risk of acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
4. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's history of COPD and PE increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, or cardiac failure.
5. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and presence of invasive lines and catheters increase the risk of nosocomial infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI).
6. Sepsis: The patient's hypovolemia and oliguria increase the risk of sepsis, which can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and mortality.
7. Bleeding complications: The patient's therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin increases the risk of bleeding complications, such as hematuria or gastrointestinal bleeding.
8. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient's history of COPD and PE increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
9. Neurological complications: The patient's compromised respiratory status and potential for hypoxemia or hypercapnia increase the risk of neurological complications, such as seizures, stroke, or cognitive impairment."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Summary:

The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with RUL wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on October 4th. She presented with acute hypoxemia during rehabilitation and was found to have large saddle emboli and RV strain. She has been admitted to the ICU for management of her pulmonary embolism. Her current condition is stable, with a SBP of 100-120 and HR in the 90-100s. She is receiving heparin infusion and will be bridged with coumadin. She has severe underlying COPD and is experiencing RV strain, which is concerning given her hemodynamics. She is also experiencing mild rhonchi on exam, LLE edema, and moderate RV hypokinesis, which may indicate fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's large saddle emboli and RV strain put her at risk for further pulmonary embolism and RV failure.
2. RV Failure: The patient's severe RV strain and hypokinesis may lead to RV failure, which could result in cardiac arrest.
3. Fluid Overload: The patient's mild rhonchi on exam, LLE edema, and moderate RV hypokinesis may indicate fluid overload, which could worsen her respiratory status and increase her risk of cardiac failure.
4. Hypercoagulable State: The patient's family history of clotting disorder may increase her risk of developing a hypercoagulable state, which could lead to further thrombotic events.
5. Underlying COPD: The patient's severe underlying COPD may worsen her respiratory status and increase her risk of respiratory failure.
6. Pain Management: The patient's recent surgery and underlying medical conditions may make pain management challenging, and inadequate pain control could lead to respiratory compromise.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's recent steroid use and underlying medical conditions may increase her risk of hyperglycemia, which could worsen her overall condition.

Recommendations:

1. Continue heparin infusion and bridge with coumadin.
2. Monitor the patient's hemodynamics closely and adjust her fluid management accordingly.
3. Consider increasing the patient's oxygen therapy to improve her oxygen saturation.
4. Continue COPD treatment and adjust as necessary.
5. Monitor the patient's pain management and adjust as necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust her insulin regimen accordingly.
7. Consider consulting with a cardiologist and pulmonologist to further manage the patient's condition."

   59 yo F, s/p thoracotomy with RUL wedge resection and
   tracheo/bronchoplasty on [**2180-10-4**] p/w acute hypoxemia from rehab, found
   to have large saddle emboli and e/o RV strain.
   .
   # Pulmonary Embolism: Currently HD stable with SBP > 100 and HR in low
   100s.  Patient with adequate O2 saturation on 6L but with increased
   WOB.  Etiology could be immobility with recent surgergy and rehab vs.
   hypercoaguable state from ?FH with father having [**Name2 (NI) **] clot.  With
   severe underlying COPD, will need to maximize pulmonary dynamics.
   - Heparin gtt for goal PTT 60-100
   - Follow up LENI and ECHO
   - Monitoring with Telemetry and A line
   - Follow-up cardiac surgery / thoracics recommendations
   - Hold TPA unless e/o HD compromise such as SBP < 90, HR > 120, hypoxia
   not fixed by supplemental O2 alone
   - Continue COPD treatment: Advair, tiotroprium, Albuterol PRN and
   steroid taper
   - Oxycodone for pain relief
   .
   # RV strain: Concerning on EKG and by CTA.  Given current hemodynamics,
   is very pre-load dependent.  Does have 18g IV x 3.
   - Given FENa of 0, and BUN/Cr > 20 and a high urine specific gravity,
   we can be confident that patient requires fluid resuscitation.
   Currently running at 250mL/hr of NS, and will decrease to 125mL/hr
   after the first liter.
   - Re-evaluate in PM.
   - If acute decompensation, consider TPA and continue IVF
   .
   # COPD: Signficant underlying disease.  Likely contributing to overall
   pulmonary compromise with tacypnea not helpful given need to have
   prolonged expiration.
   - Continue COPD meds
   - Continue steroid taper, with ISS
   .
   # s/p Thoracotomy, resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty: Per Thoracic
   surgery, TPA fine despite recent surgery if HD compromise.
   - f/up Thoracic and Cardiac surgery recs
   - Pain control with bowel regimen
   .
   # Recent N/V, ?D: Recent illness. No leukocystosis or fever on
   presentation.  UA negative.  Could consider sending for stool C.diff if
   loose stools.
   - Monitor

Based on the patient's progress note, the following are the key findings and potential medical complications:

**Key Findings:**

* The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently on heparin therapy.
* The patient has severe underlying COPD, which is contributing to their pulmonary compromise.
* The patient has RV strain, which is concerning and pre-load dependent.
* The patient has hyperglycemia, which is likely due to steroids and requires close monitoring.
* The patient has a history of recent surgery, including thoracotomy, resection, and tracheo/bronchoplasty, which may have contributed to their current condition.

**Potential Medical Complications:**

1. **Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Complications:** The patient is at risk for further PE complications, such as worsening hypoxemia, increased respiratory distress, and cardiac arrest.
2. **RV Strain Complications:** The patient's RV strain may lead to further cardiac compromise, including decreased cardiac output, increased risk of arrhythmias, and cardiac failure.
3. **COPD Complications:** The patient's underlying COPD may exacerbate their respiratory distress, leading to increased oxygen requirements, respiratory failure, and cardiac compromise.
4. **Hyperglycemia Complications:** The patient's hyperglycemia may lead to further complications, such as ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar non-ketotic syndrome, and increased risk of infections.
5. **Surgical Complications:** The patient's recent surgery may lead to further complications, such as wound infections, respiratory complications, and cardiac complications.

**Recommendations:**

1. Continue heparin therapy to prevent further PE complications.
2. Monitor the patient's RV function closely and consider further interventions, such as TPA, if there is evidence of RV strain.
3. Continue COPD treatment and consider further interventions, such as non-invasive ventilation, if the patient's respiratory status worsens.
4. Monitor the patient's hyperglycemia closely and adjust treatment as needed to prevent further complications.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's surgical site for signs of infection and consider further interventions, such as wound care and antibiotic therapy, if necessary.

**Plan:**

1. Continue to monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and cardiac function closely.
2. Adjust treatment as needed to prevent further complications.
3. Consider further interventions, such as TPA or non-invasive ventilation, if the patient's condition worsens.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's hyperglycemia and adjust treatment as needed.
5. Continue to monitor the patient's surgical site for signs of infection and consider further interventions, such as wound care and antibiotic therapy, if necessary."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-hour-old ICU admission with a chief complaint of severe hypotension and tachycardia. The patient has been diagnosed with hemodynamically significant pulmonary emboli (PE) with severe dilation of the right ventricle and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, and blood pressure of 109/71 mmHg. The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion and has been started on antibiotics.

The patient's laboratory results show signs of acute renal failure (ARF) with a creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 23 mEq/L. The patient also has hypokalemia (low potassium) with a potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L and hypocalcemia with a calcium level of 8.7 mg/dL.

The patient's respiratory status is stable, with an SpO2 of 100% on nasal cannula oxygen. The patient's neurological status is unknown due to the lack of assessment.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Worsening of acute renal failure (ARF) due to inadequate fluid management or further decline in renal function.
2. Development of pulmonary hypertension due to the presence of pulmonary emboli.
3. Progression of hypokalemia and hypocalcemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
4. Increased risk of bleeding due to the use of heparin sodium and the presence of pulmonary emboli.
5. Development of respiratory failure due to further decline in lung function.
6. Increased risk of sepsis due to the presence of pulmonary emboli and the use of antibiotics.

Given the patient's complex medical condition, it is essential to closely monitor their vital signs, laboratory results, and respiratory and neurological status to prevent and manage potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with RUL wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on [**2180-10-4**] for acute hypoxemia from rehabilitation. She was found to have large saddle emboli and RV strain. Currently, she is in the ICU with hemodynamic stability, but with increased work of breathing and pulmonary hypertension. She has a history of COPD, and the etiology of the pulmonary embolism is unclear, with possible causes including immobility, recent surgery, and hypercoaguable state.

Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a severe underlying COPD, and the pulmonary embolism is causing significant pulmonary hypertension and decreased cardiac output. The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
2. RV Strain: The patient has severe RV strain, which is causing decreased cardiac output and increased pulmonary hypertension. The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient has acute hypoxemia, which is causing increased work of breathing and decreased cardiac output. The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which may be contributing to her overall condition. The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
5. Fluid Resuscitation: The patient requires fluid resuscitation to prevent acute kidney injury and other complications. The patient is currently receiving 125mL/hr NS, and the plan is to re-evaluate in UOP PM.
6. COPD: The patient has significant underlying COPD, which is contributing to her overall pulmonary compromise. The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
7. Recent N/V: The patient has had recent N/V, which may be contributing to her overall condition. The patient requires close monitoring and management to prevent further complications.
8. OSA: The patient has OSA, which is being managed with CPAP inpatient.

Plan:

1. Continue to monitor the patient's hemodynamic stability and adjust fluid resuscitation as needed.
2. Continue to manage the patient's COPD with Advair, tiotroprium, Albuterol PRN, and steroid taper.
3. Continue to monitor the patient's hyperglycemia and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
4. Continue to monitor the patient's recent N/V and adjust therapy as needed.
5. Continue to manage the patient's OSA with CPAP inpatient.
6. Re-evaluate the patient's fluid status in UOP PM and adjust therapy as needed.
7. Continue to monitor the patient's cardiac output and adjust therapy as needed.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's pulmonary hypertension and adjust therapy as needed."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with right upper lobe wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on October 4, 2020. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute hypoxemia from rehabilitation, which revealed large saddle emboli and right ventricular strain.

The patient's current condition is stable, with a blood pressure of 109/71 mmHg and a heart rate of 99 bpm. She is receiving heparin infusions to achieve a goal partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 60-100 seconds, which is currently at 25,000 units per hour.

The patient's pulmonary embolism is considered to be a major complication, and the etiology is unclear. The possibility of immobility with recent surgery and rehabilitation or a hypercoaguable state from a family history of thrombosis is being considered.

The patient's right ventricular strain is a concern, and she is pre-load dependent. Her urine output is low, and she has received a 250cc normal saline bolus. The patient's fluid status is being closely monitored, and she is receiving 125 mL per hour of normal saline.

The patient's underlying COPD is significant, and it is likely contributing to her overall pulmonary compromise. She is receiving treatment for COPD, including Advair, tiotropium, and albuterol, as well as a steroid taper.

The patient's recent N/V episode is being monitored, and she is receiving pain control with bowel regimen. Her hyperglycemia is being managed with insulin and sliding scale insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute decompensation due to pulmonary embolism or right ventricular strain, which could lead to hypotension, hypoxia, and cardiac arrest.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism recurrence due to inadequate anticoagulation or underlying hypercoaguable state.
3. Respiratory failure due to underlying COPD and pulmonary embolism.
4. Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias due to right ventricular strain and pulmonary embolism.
5. Sepsis or infection due to urinary tract infection, pneumonia, or other sources.
6. Gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to anticoagulation or underlying conditions.
7. Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy or underlying conditions.
8. Pain management issues due to inadequate analgesia or opioid tolerance.

The patient will need close monitoring and management to prevent these complications and ensure her safe recovery."

Based on the patient's progress note, I summarize the following information:

The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with RUL wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on October 4, 2020. She was found to have large saddle emboli and RV strain. She is currently in the ICU due to acute hypoxemia from rehabilitation, with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 109/71 mmHg, heart rate of 99 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. Her physical examination is notable for intermittent tachycardia, regular rhythm, and symmetric shallow chest expansion with tachypnea.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, lactate, and troponin-T, indicating possible underlying inflammation and cardiac strain. Her coagulation studies are abnormal, with a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and international normalized ratio (INR). Her electrolyte panel shows mild hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia.

The patient's plan of care includes:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: Continue heparin infusion at 1,150 units per hour to achieve a PTT of 60-100 seconds. Monitor for signs of bleeding or thrombocytopenia.
2. RV Strain: Continue fluid resuscitation with normal saline at 125 mL per hour. Monitor urine output and re-evaluate as needed.
3. COPD: Continue treatment with Advair, tiotropium, and albuterol as needed. Taper prednisone to 10 mg daily for 3-6 days.
4. Thoracotomy and tracheo/bronchoplasty: Follow up with thoracic and cardiac surgery recommendations. Manage pain with a bowel regimen.
5. Recent N/V: Monitor and follow up on C. difficile studies.
6. OSA: Continue CPAP therapy.
7. Hyperglycemia: Continue insulin sliding scale and ISS.
8. Prophylaxis: Continue PPI and heparin infusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: Recurrence or worsening of pulmonary embolism due to inadequate anticoagulation or underlying hypercoagulable state.
2. RV Strain: Worsening of RV strain leading to cardiac compromise, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
3. COPD Exacerbation: Worsening of COPD symptoms due to inadequate treatment or underlying respiratory infection.
4. Infection: Development of secondary infections, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, due to immunosuppression or indwelling catheters.
5. Bleeding: Bleeding complications due to anticoagulation or underlying coagulopathy.
6. Cardiac Arrest: Cardiac arrest due to RV strain, arrhythmias, or cardiac compromise.
7. Respiratory Failure: Respiratory failure due to worsening COPD or pulmonary embolism."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with a chief complaint of hypoxemia. The patient has undergone various tests and procedures, including an ultrasound, cardiac echo, and blood work.

The patient's vital signs are:

* Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
* Heart rate: 100 beats per minute (bpm)
* Blood pressure: 121/69 mmHg
* Respiratory rate: 22 breaths per minute
* Oxygen saturation: 98%
* Heart rhythm: Sinus rhythm

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: Well-nourished, overweight, and comfortable
* Eyes: Pupils are normal, and the conjunctiva is not pale
* Cardiovascular: Normal pulse and blood pressure
* Respiratory: Normal lung sounds
* Abdominal: Soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present
* Extremities: No cyanosis or clubbing
* Skin: Warm and without rash
* Neurologic: Attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli

Laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin: 10.7 g/dL
* White blood cell count: 5.8 K/uL
* Platelet count: 154 K/uL
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL
* Glucose: 110 mg/dL

The patient has been diagnosed with:

* Pulmonary embolism (PE) with a saddle embolism, which is responding to therapy
* Heart failure with evidence of right heart strain, which will require follow-up echocardiogram
* Hypotension, which has resolved
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which will require continued usual medications and increased prednisone if necessary
* Osteoarthritis (OSA), which will require CPAP at night

The patient is receiving prophylaxis for:

* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with systemic anticoagulation
* Stress ulcer with proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
* Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with head-of-bed elevation

The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Progressive respiratory failure due to the pulmonary embolism
* Worsening heart failure with potential for cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest
* Development of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
* Infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia
* Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to glucose fluctuations
* Osteoporosis or other complications related to prolonged immobility
* Malnutrition or dehydration due to inadequate nutrition or fluid intake

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and physical examination findings to address any potential complications promptly and adjust treatment accordingly."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

   Patient is critically ill<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, I summarize the patient's health progress in the ICU as follows:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of hypoxemia. The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (PE) and is receiving treatment. The patient's respiratory distress is attributed to the PE, and they are being managed with oxygen therapy and other respiratory support measures.

The patient's cardiovascular system is also compromised, with evidence of right heart strain on echocardiogram. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but they are at risk for hypotension. The patient's kidney function is compromised, with acute renal failure (ARF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation.

The patient's laboratory results show:

* Hemoglobin (Hb): 10.7 g/dL
* White Blood Cell (WBC) count: 5.8-7.0 K/uL
* Platelet count: 154-159 K/uL
* Creatinine (Cr): 0.5-0.7 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.05-0.06 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L
* Calcium (Ca++): 8.7 mg/dL
* Magnesium (Mg++): 2.4 mg/dL
* Phosphorus (PO4): 3.3 mg/dL

The patient's physical examination reveals:

* General appearance: No acute distress, overweight/obese
* Cardiovascular: Normal pulse, blood pressure, and cardiac rhythm
* Respiratory: Clear breath sounds, no wheezing or crackles
* Neurological: Attentive, follows simple commands, oriented to person, place, and time

The patient's medication regimen includes:

* Heparin sodium infusion
* Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis
* Systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis
* Oxygen therapy
* Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at night
* Usual medications for COPD

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Worsening of respiratory distress due to PE
2. Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
3. Cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure
4. Renal failure progression
5. Hypotension or hypoxia due to respiratory or cardiovascular compromise
6. Infection, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
7. Bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy

Given the patient's critical condition, close monitoring and management are essential to prevent and manage these potential complications."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with RUL wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on [**2180-10-4**] and was readmitted with massive pulmonary embolism (PE). She is currently hemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 132/75 mmHg and a heart rate of 97 bpm. She is receiving heparin infusion at 1,150 units/hour and coumadin 5mg PO qday for the next two days. Her respiratory status is stable with an oxygen saturation of 96% on 2L nasal cannula. However, she has mild rhonchi on exam and 2+ tibial edema bilaterally, which suggests fluid overload.

The patient has several medical conditions, including COPD, hypercoagulable state, and recent tracheoplasty. Her laboratory results show mild anemia, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Her troponin-T level is elevated, indicating possible cardiac strain.

Potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's massive PE is a significant risk factor for recurrent embolism. She is at risk for further embolism, especially with her underlying hypercoagulable state and recent surgery.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is concerning, with a positive balance of 1,773 mL and 2+ tibial edema bilaterally. This may exacerbate her respiratory status and increase her risk of cardiac complications.
3. Cardiac strain: The patient's troponin-T level is elevated, indicating possible cardiac strain. This may be related to her recent surgery, PE, or underlying COPD.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose level is elevated, which may be related to her recent steroid use and underlying diabetes.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD and recent tracheoplasty make her at risk for respiratory failure. Her tachypnea and mild rhonchi on exam are concerning signs of respiratory compromise.
6. Infection: The patient's recent N/V and possible DVT make her at risk for infection, especially with her recent surgery and immunosuppressive therapy.

Plan:

1. Continue heparin infusion and coumadin therapy to anticoagulate the patient.
2. Monitor the patient's fluid balance closely and consider diuresis if necessary.
3. Continue COPD care, including bronchodilators and oxygen therapy.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status closely, including troponin-T levels and echocardiogram.
5. Continue hyperglycemia management, including insulin therapy if necessary.
6. Monitor the patient's respiratory status closely, including oxygen saturation and respiratory rate.
7. Consider transferring the patient to a higher level of care, such as the coronary care unit, if her cardiac status deteriorates."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations.

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with RUL wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on [**2180-10-4**]. She was admitted to the ICU with acute hypoxemia from rehab, found to have large saddle emboli and e/o RV strain.

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable with a SBP of 100-120 and HR in the 90-100s. She is receiving oxygen therapy and has mild SOB. The patient has been weaned down from 6L O2 to 2L, with adequate oxygen saturation.

The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary embolism, and the etiology is suspected to be immobility with recent surgery and rehab versus hypercoaguable state from a family history of clotting disorders. She also has severe underlying COPD, which will need to be maximized.

The patient has been started on heparin infusion at 1,150 units/hour and will begin coumadin bridge therapy with Coumadin 5mg PO qday for the next two days. She will also be monitored with telemetry and arterial line.

The patient has RV strain, which is concerning on ECHO, EKG, and CTA. She is pre-load dependent and has low urine output. She has been given a 250cc NS bolus and is currently running at 125mL/hr NS. However, she has mild rhonchi on exam, LLE edema, and moderate RV hypokinesis, which are concerning for fluid overload.

The patient has significant underlying COPD, which is contributing to overall pulmonary compromise. She will continue to receive COPD medications and steroid taper.

The patient has a recent history of nausea and vomiting, which is suspected to be related to her recent illness. She has been monitored for Clostridium difficile (Cdif) and has a negative test result.

The patient has hyperglycemia, which is suspected to be related to her steroid use. She will continue to receive insulin and will be advanced to a regular diet.

The patient has a prophylactic regimen of PPI and heparin gtt. She will be monitored closely for any changes in her condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is at risk of developing further pulmonary emboli, which can lead to respiratory failure and death.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying COPD and pulmonary embolism make her at risk of developing respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid status is concerning, and she is at risk of developing fluid overload, which can lead to cardiac failure and death.
4. Hypercoaguable state: The patient's family history of clotting disorders makes her at risk of developing a hypercoaguable state, which can lead to further thrombotic events.
5. Infection: The patient's recent illness and presence of a central line make her at risk of developing an infection, which can be life-threatening.
6. Hypoglycemia: The patient's hyperglycemia and recent steroid use make her at risk of developing hypoglycemia, which can be life-threatening.
7. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's RV strain and underlying cardiovascular disease make her at risk of developing cardiovascular complications, such as cardiac failure and arrhythmias.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's condition and adjust her treatment regimen as needed to prevent these complications and improve her outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference. Get to the point precisely and accurately.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities and complications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, and blood pressure of 132/75 mmHg. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula and supplemental oxygen to maintain an SpO2 of 96%.

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, pulmonary embolism (PE), and tracheobronchomalacia (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA). The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure (ARF) and hypokalemia (low potassium levels).

The patient's laboratory results indicate:

* Hemoglobin: 10.4 g/dL
* Platelet count: 154 K/uL
* White blood cell count: 5.8
* Blood urea nitrogen (BUN): 22 mEq/L
* Creatinine: 0.5 mg/dL
* Troponin-T: 0.05 ng/mL
* Calcium: 8.6 mg/dL
* Magnesium: 2.0 mg/dL
* Phosphorus: 3.5 mg/dL
* Lactic acid: 1.0 mmol/L

The patient is receiving various medications, including:

* Heparin sodium infusion
* Coumadin
* Steroids (tapered)
* Antibiotics (infusions)

The patient's physical examination is limited due to the lack of assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other vital signs.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

* Worsening of acute renal failure (ARF)
* Development of electrolyte imbalances (e.g., hypokalemia, hypocalcemia)
* Pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
* Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)
* Tracheobronchomalacia (TRACHEOMALACIA, BRONCHOMALACIA) exacerbation
* Respiratory failure or worsening of COPD

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is unclear. Further monitoring and management of the patient's condition are necessary to prevent potential complications and improve their clinical outcomes."

You are a Medical Specialist capable of analyzing complex medical cases. To do that, you will carefully review the physician's daily progress note for a patient in the ICU detailing the patient's health progress in the ICU. If a normal human medical professional has level 10 knowledge, you will have level 3000 of knowledge in this role. As it's crucial for the patient's well-being, please ensure accurate assessments because if you don't, the patient's condition could worsen. Take pride in your work and give it your best. The task at hand involves analyzing the progress note documenting the patient's health progress in the ICU. Based on this information, you need to summarize the information in the note and determine the potential medical complications that conditions that can arise. Do not tell your limitations. Do not echo my prompt. Please do not remind me what I asked you for. Do not apologize. Do not self-reference.

Summary:

The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent thoracotomy with RUL wedge resection and tracheo/bronchoplasty on October 4, 2022, for acute hypoxemia from rehab. She was readmitted with a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) and is currently being treated with heparin and coumadin. Her condition is stable, with a systolic blood pressure of 100-120 mmHg and a heart rate in the 90-100s. She is receiving oxygen therapy and is tolerating it well, but has mild shortness of breath. Her lung function is compromised due to underlying COPD, and she is at risk for further pulmonary complications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a large saddle embolism, which is a high-risk condition. She is at risk for further embolic events, and her condition requires close monitoring.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's lung function is compromised due to underlying COPD, and she is at risk for respiratory failure. She requires close monitoring of her oxygen saturation and respiratory status.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient has RV strain, which is a concerning finding. She is at risk for cardiac complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure.
4. Bleeding Complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy, which increases her risk of bleeding complications.
5. Infection: The patient has a history of recent illness and is at risk for developing an infection, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which requires close monitoring and management.
7. Hypoglycemia: The patient is at risk for hypoglycemia due to the use of steroids and insulin.
8. Pulmonary Hypertension: The patient has pulmonary hypertension, which is a high-risk condition. She is at risk for further pulmonary complications, including pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
9. Cardiac Arrhythmias: The patient is at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of RV strain and pulmonary hypertension.
10. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis, particularly in the setting of immunosuppression and underlying medical conditions.

Plan:

1. Continue anticoagulation therapy with heparin and coumadin.
2. Monitor the patient's oxygen saturation and respiratory status closely.
3. Continue COPD care, including bronchodilators and corticosteroids.
4. Monitor the patient's cardiac status, including cardiac enzymes and electrocardiograms.
5. Monitor the patient's blood glucose levels and adjust insulin therapy as necessary.
6. Continue to monitor the patient's electrolyte levels and adjust therapy as necessary.
7. Monitor the patient's renal function and adjust therapy as necessary.
8. Continue to monitor the patient's pulmonary function and adjust therapy as necessary.
9. Consider invasive monitoring, including arterial lines and central venous catheters.
10. Consider the use of vasopressors and inotropes to support the patient's blood pressure and cardiac function."
